  "title": "Please Read Before Posting or Commenting",
  "selftext": "**Welcome to Anarchy 101!** \n\nBefore you post or comment, please take a moment to read the sidebar and familiarize yourself with our resources and rules. \n\nAnd if your question is likely to be of the *frequently asked* variety, take a minute to make use of the search bar. Some questions, like those related to \"law enforcement\" or the precise relationship of anarchy to hierarchy and authority, are asked and answered on an almost daily basis, so the best answers may have already been posted. \n\nIf your question seems unanswered, please state it clearly in the post title, with whatever additional clarification seems necessary in the text itself. \n\nPlease keep in mind that this is indeed a 101 sub, designed to be a resource for those learning the basics of a consistent anarchism. The rules about limiting debate and antagonistic posting are there for a reason, so that we can keep this a useful and welcoming space for students of anarchist ideas—and for anyone else who can cooperate in keeping the quality of responses high. \n\nWe welcome debate on topics related to anarchism in r/DebateAnarchism and recommend general posts about anarchist topics be directed to r/anarchism or any of the more specialized anarchist subreddits. We expect a certain amount of contentious back-and-forth in the process of fully answering questions, but if you find that the answer to your question—or response to your comment—leads to a debate, rather than a clarifying question, please consider taking the discussion to r/DebateAnarchism. For better or worse, avoiding debate sometimes involves “reading the room” a bit and recognizing that not every potentially anarchist idea can be usefully expressed in a general, 101-level discussion. \n\nWe don’t do subreddit drama—including posts highlighting drama from this subreddit. If you have suggestions for this subreddit, please contact the moderators. \n\nPlease don’t advocate illegal acts. All subreddits are subject to Reddit’s [sitewide content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)—and radical subreddits are often subject to extra scrutiny. \n\nAvoid discussing individuals in ways that might be taken as defamatory. Your call-out is unlikely to clarify basic anarchist ideas—and it may increase the vulnerability of the subreddit. \n\nAnd don’t ask us to choose between two anti-anarchist tendencies. That never seems to lead anywhere good. \n\nIn general, just remember that *this is a forum for questions about anarchist topics and answers reflecting some specific knowledge of anarchist sources.* Other posts or comments, however interesting, useful or well-intentioned, may be removed. \n\nSome additional thoughts:\n\nThings always go most smoothly when the questions are really about anarchism and the answers are provided by anarchists. Almost without exception, requests for anarchist opinions about non-anarchist tendencies and figures lead to contentious exchanges with Redditors who are, at best, unprepared to provide *anarchist* answers to the questions raised. Feelings get hurt and people get banned. Threads are removed and sometimes have to be locked. \n\nWe expect that lot of the questions here will involve comparisons with capitalism, Marxism or existing governmental systems. That's natural, but the subreddit is obviously a better resource for learning about anarchism if those questions—and the discussions they prompt—remain focused on anarchism. *If your question seems likely to draw in capitalists, Marxists or defenders of other non-anarchist tendencies, the effect is much the same as posting a topic for debate.* Those threads are sometimes *popular*—in the sense that they get a lot of responses and active up- and down-voting—but it is almost always a matter of more heat than light when it comes to clarifying anarchist ideas and practices. \n\nWe also expect, since this is a general anarchist forum, that we will not always be able to avoid sectarian differences among proponents of different anarchist tendencies. This is another place where the 101 nature of the forum comes into play. Rejection of capitalism, statism, etc. is fundamental, but perhaps internal struggles for the soul of the anarchist movement are at least a 200-level matter. If nothing else, embracing a bit of “anarchism without adjectives” *while in this particular subreddit* helps keep things focused on answering people's questions. If you want to offer a differing perspective, based on more specific ideological commitments, simply identifying the tendency and the grounds for disagreement should help introduce the diversity of anarchist thought without moving us into the realm of debate.\n\nWe grind away at some questions—constantly and seemingly endlessly in the most extreme cases—and that can be frustrating. More than that, it can be disturbing, disheartening to find that anarchist ideas remain in flux on some very fundamental topics. Chances are good, however, that whatever seemingly interminable debate you find yourself involved in will not suddenly be resolved by some intellectual or rhetorical masterstroke. Say what you can say, as clearly as you can manage, and then feel free to take a sanity break—until the next, more or less inevitable go-round. We do make progress in clarifying these difficult, important issues—even relatively rapid progress on occasion, but it often seems to happen in spite of our passion for the subjects. \n\nIn addition, you may have noticed that it’s a crazy old world out there, in ways that continue to take their toll on most of us, one way or another. Participation in most forums remains high and a bit distracted, while our collective capacity to self-manage is *still* not a great deal better online than it is anywhere else. *We're all still a little plague-stricken and the effects are generally more contagious than we expect or acknowledge.* Be just a bit more thoughtful about your participation here, just as you would in other aspects of your daily life. And if others are obviously not doing their part, consider using the *report* button, rather than pouring fuel on the fire. Increased participation makes the potential utility and reach of a forum like this even greater—provided we all do the little things necessary to make sure it remains an educational resource that folks with questions can actually navigate.\n\n*A final note:* \n\n— The question of violence is often not far removed from our discussions, whether it is a question of present-day threats, protest tactics, revolutionary strategy, anarchistic alternatives to police and military, or various similar topics. We need to be able to talk, at times, about the role that violence might play in anti-authoritarian social relations and we certainly need, at other times, to be clear with one another about the role of violence in our daily lives, whether as activists or simply as members of violent societies. We need to be able to do so with a mix of common sense and respect for basic security culture—but also sensitivity to the fact that violence is indeed endemic to our cultures, so keeping our educational spaces free of unnecessary triggers and discussions that are only likely to compound existing traumas ought to be among the tasks we all share as participants. Posts and comments seeming to advocate violence for its own sake or to dwell on it unnecessarily are likely to be removed.",

  "selftext": "I've had an argument with an ancap who turned out to be a fan of georgism, believing that it is not left.\n\nMy last argument before they dropped it was that georgism is left and radical because it removes proletarian as a class.\n\n**Under (libertarian) Capitalism**\n\nThe only legal ways of getting property are trade and original appropriation.\n\nOriginal appropriation means \"mixing your labor\" with natural resource. It's seen as if unowned becomes rightfully owned. E.g. by working a field.\n\nIt totally ignores that so-called unowned resource was common before appropriation, that was giving economic value of natural resource to all people for free. E.g. common pasture or beach.\n\nWe can conceptualize it as all (local) people being shareholder of the common asset. Privatization robs everyone of their share with no compensation.\n\nThe result is that common people lose the means of subsistence they traditionally had.\n\n*Proletarians appear* - people whose only means of subsistence is selling labor for wages.\n\nThere's urgency to find a job that feeds you. You have little bargaining power on the conditions.\n\nThe rich who can survive for long without working now can take advantage of the poor, i.e. low wages, bossing around, unreasonable interests.\n\nExploitation happens. Rich get extra rich. Poor remain poor.\n\n**Under Georgism**\n\nLand (uncreated natural resources) is everyone's.\n\nNobody is entitled for economic rent (in classical sense).\n\nIf you exclude people from some resource, you need to compensate everyone for it's raw, unimproved real market value.\n\nHence, eveyone has a share of natural wealth. Whether it's self-employment in subsistence farming or income from dividents, you have other means of subsistence other than selling your labor.\n\n*Proletarians cease to be a thing.*\n\nNow there's no urgency to sell your labor. If you think it's a good deal you go for it, but you don't have to.\n\nIt changes everything, as now, bargaining with an employer, you have much stronger position. Employment gets voluntary, a way to have extra.\n\nIn a developped economy where dividents from land are high work itself becomes optional.\n\n**How to coordinate it with Socialism?**\n\nSo, under Georgism a good half of means of production are socially owned.\n\nHowever, artificial capital goods are still privately owned, on the moral premise that you own what you produce or buy, and on pragmatic premise that profitability of advanced tools stimulates their production.\n\nGeorgism is aimed at growth and incentivizing effecient organization of business. The dream is having rich without having poor.\n\nDoes it vibe with Socialism at all? I feel like it does, but private ownership on produced capital goods makes me doubt.",

That's, to put it mildly, a lot. In the absence of a market similar to what we now have, how can this be sourced?\n\nAnother issue is the land amount used. A modern nuclear plant complex, with its safety zones, associated maintenance and production buildings, often housing for constructors and employees, is many square kilometers.\n\nIf one was to build a new nuclear power plant, how would that kind of a landmass be taken to use? It's pretty likely that the land is already utilized by someone, and given that you prolly don't want to build a nuclear power plant in the middle of absolutely nowhere, it's also likely several people already live in that area.\n\nThe same question goes to many other large projects, from very large bridges to e.g. CERN's particle accelerators.\n\nGaining consensus from all the people who are affected, I imagine, would be nigh impossible.\n\nI have a few solutions I can think of:\n\n- It might be that such large projects are inherently inefficient and unnecessary. Small nuclear power plants might make more sense. But then there's still the question of how e.g. uranium is sourced, given that sourcing it is commonly environmentally problematic and requires large land areas. Or, perhaps even nuclear power just isn't needed if all the excesses of a hierarchical, capitalist society were done away with. Perhaps small scale wind farms etc were sufficient.\n\n- A market not entirely dissimilar to now might be possible without exploitation and the accumulation of ownership. But I've difficulty seeing how it would work at scale without power centralizing to the hands of the largest participants in that market.\n\n- Perhaps in a world where it's clear that e.g. the plant is not for a power company to turn a profit with, but is genuinely needed for supplying people with electricity and heat, people would be more willing to find a consensus and participate on a voluntary basis.",

I'd thus like to know how to you approach anarchism in practice? How does it affect the things you do?\n\nFor me for example, to support my own beliefs and because I simply like to do those things, I participate in some DIY non-profit projects; including e.g. open source projects, but also stuff like helping build and run a DIY non-profit festival. I've also arranged free gigs and concretely driven people and equipment around for them.\n\nAt work, I try to promote transparency and minimal hierarchies. As a part of that, I participated in shop stewards elections and now am a shop steward. It's a bit tricky role in all honesty, since the role is about representing employees at large all of whom have different opinions and who should directly participate in decision-making, but I do genuinely believe that supporting open discussion and non-hierarchical approach to things is genuinely good for employees, rather than it only being my own belief about how things should be done.\n\nIn politics, I'm not an activist and find parliamentary politics quite distasteful and perhaps somewhat a waste of time, but I vote on the principle of minimal harm, and I've ran in municipal elections, with the agenda of wanting to support open participation to decision-making and wanting to support e.g. free spaces for everyone.\n\nI'm also an union member and support unionization, as I believe that helps in promoting employee self-management and is a counter-force to rampant capitalism.\n\nSo - how do your beliefs affect your daily life and the things you do?

You, as a group, have decided that it's a good idea that there's a few sober people working security, with the right to remove people from the premises. The reason you do this is so that the people coming to the festival can feel safe and don't have to worry about being in a state where they needed to use force themselves. All the organizers agree, and the vast majority of people coming to the festival also agree.\n\nThere is, of course, authority there. In my view, it is a justifiable - and perhaps even unavoidable at least given that there's alcohol involved - authority.\n\nWhere I'd draw the line is when authority requires a centralized apparatus to enforce it, and where submission to that authority is no longer voluntary. But when a group of people works on something or arranges something, I'd say they've the authority to set e.g. rules about that thing.\n\nYet this idea seems to often clash with anarchist ideals that would be against all authority.\n\nSo the question has two parts:\n\nOne, if such authority indeed is unacceptable, how would it be avoided and how would it be compatible with an anarchist society if a group of people want to e.g. run a bar with rules that they want to enforce? In my books, such would constitute authority, albeit one limited to a particular time and place rather than the larger society.\n\nTwo, if such use of authority is acceptable, but it is not really authority as meant in anarchist discourse, then what is it?",

Wade decision did not take place because a majority of the US population supported abortion access in 1973. Rather, in view of organizing efforts such as the Jane collective, which provided an estimated 11,000 illegal abortions, we can conclude that the ruling was a response to the intensity with which a particular segment of the population was fighting for abortion access, and to their success in calling the state’s monopoly on power into question by continuing to make abortion available despite the efforts of police and judges*.\" [https://crimethinc.com/2022/06/27/to-defend-abortion-access-take-the-offensive-strategizing-for-direct-action](https://crimethinc.com/2022/06/27/to-defend-abortion-access-take-the-offensive-strategizing-for-direct-action)\n\nOr according to An Anarchist FAQ: \"*after the Popular Front was elected February 1936 and the Spanish landless workers, sick and tired of waiting for the politicians to act, started to occupy the land. The government \"resorted to the time-tested procedure of expelling the peasants with the Civil Guard.\" The peasants responded with a \"dramatic rebellion\" which forced the politicians to \"legalise the occupied farms. This proved once again that the only effective reforms are those imposed by force from below. Indeed, direct action was infinitely more successful than all the parliamentary debates that took place between 1931 and 1933 about whether to institute the approved Agrarian Reform law.*\" **\\[Abel Paz, Durruti in the Spanish Revolution, p. 391\\]** \" [https://www.anarchistfaq.org/afaq/sectionJ.html#secj29](https://www.anarchistfaq.org/afaq/sectionJ.html#secj29)\n\nAnd for the last example, according to Robert Levering ( who was a full-time anti-Vietnam War organizer from 1967 to 1973.), the \"**Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam**\" demonstrations and teach-ins influenced Richard Nixon to end the Vietnam war:\n\n*As a result of the demonstrations, Nixon cancelled his war plans. He wrote in his memoirs that the protests had “undercut the credibility of the ultimatum.”*\n\n*What about Nixon’s claim to have ignored the Nov. 15 Mobilization? “Untrue,” according to Daniel Ellsberg, who was then working for the Nixon administration: “Every 10 minutes he \\[Nixon\\] was calling the Situation Room and finding out what was going on, getting the reports from the U-2s on crowd size… He was totally absorbed.”*\n\n*Admiral Thomas Moorer, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Nixon administration, acknowledged that the government always was concerned about how the antiwar movement would react. He said that the movement “served to inhibit and restrain the decision makers… both in the executive and legislative branches of the government.”*\n\nHere's the article: [https://wagingnonviolence.org/2019/11/anti-vietnam-war-moratorium-mobilization-nixon/](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2019/11/anti-vietnam-war-moratorium-mobilization-nixon/)\n\nHe was also an executive producer for the documentary about the demonstrations called \" The Movement and the \"Madman\". \" [https://www.movementandthemadman.com/](https://www.movementandthemadman.com/)\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "So the us election season is starting up and the arguments for and against it are revving up again.\n\nOne argument I've heard is about \"choosing your opponent\".\n\nFrom what I understand, the argument for it assumes that one is inherently easier to fight against than the other. Critics along these lines may assume that power is monolithic, namely a possession of the power holder, whereas some detractors assume it is relational and is subject to change.\n\nThe counter-argument is that both candidates rely on the same source of power ( the consent of the ruled, including the functionaries.) and that whatever differences they have (either by using repression or co-optation) can be accounted for through planning/training/etc.\n\nAccording to Gene Sharp's theory of power\\*1, the consent that gives power to rulers includes consent by functionaries such as police, soldiers, prison guards, and executioners, and those who feed, clothe, and arm them. When support by such functionaries is withdrawn, the power of a ruler evaporates.\n\nNow for what should anarchists do instead, the usual argument among most is, to quote Proudhon, the *\"problem before the labouring classes . . . consists not in capturing, but in subduing both power and monopoly, -- that is, in generating from the bowels of the people, from the depths of labour, a greater authority, a more potent fact, which shall envelop capital and the state and subjugate them.\"* \n\nFor, *\"to combat and reduce power, to put it in its proper place in society, it is of no use to change the holders of power or introduce some variation into its workings: an agricultural and industrial combination must be found by means of which power, today the ruler of society, shall become its slave.\"* **\\[System of Economical Contradictions, p. 398 and p. 397\\]** \n\nThey do this by organising what Bakunin called *\"antipolitical social power of the working classes.\"* **\\[Bakunin on Anarchism, p. 263\\]** This activity which bases itself on the two broad strategies of encouraging direct action and building alternatives where we live and work. \n\nAccording to them, anarchists need to persuade *\"as many people as possible that their freedom . . . depends not on the right to vote or securing a majority of votes . . . but on evolving new forms of political and social organisation which aim at the direct participation of the people, with the consequent weakening of the power, as well as of the social role, of government in the life of the community.\"* **\\[\"Anarchists and Voting\", pp. 176-87, The Raven, No. 14, pp. 177-8\\]** \n\nThey discuss what new forms of economic and social organisations that this could involve in section J.5 of An Anarchist FAQ\\*2\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*1 to know more about the theory's strengths and limitations, check this link:\n\n[https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/89jpr.pdf](https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/89jpr.pdf)\n\n\\*2 to find out more about these strategies, check these links from An Anarchist FAQ:\n\n[https://www.anarchistfaq.org/afaq/sectionJ.html#secj5](https://www.anarchistfaq.org/afaq/sectionJ.html#secj5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

There is a book, film or something told from an anarchist perspective?\n\nSpare me if you don´t understand everything that I write. English is not my mother's tongue.\n\nThanks",

Taxing the rich so the government can build homes involves both initiating force (taxes) and government (both to tax and to build). Charity, i.e. \"non-profits\", is/are hierarchical as well as capitalist largely in all but name and NGOs can exploit labor as ruthlessly as a \"proper\" capitalist company.\n\n(For an anarchist critique of charity, see: [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/dean-spade-solidarity-not-charity](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/dean-spade-solidarity-not-charity). Also some people have argued against even mutual aid, see: [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/black-flag-sydney-socialism-is-not-charity-why-we-re-against-mutual-aid](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/black-flag-sydney-socialism-is-not-charity-why-we-re-against-mutual-aid).)\n\nSo what I wonder about is - what are some *practical*, not theoretical, steps that a person could do *right now on the ground* to start *directly* solving homelessness anarchistically?\n\nAs I've grappled with anarchism more and more I've found myself to not only like it more and more but also seen that it seems it is one of those things that you just can't \"start with a precooked vision for\" but must develop organically. So the question is, how can you organically start growing that solution and in a committed, diligent manner?",

  "selftext": "Idk how to title this, but like I wanted to know how you guys balanced your social life and your ideals. I’m a asd adhd teen, who loves to debate and discuss political and social topics as my main form of social interaction. But I’m noticing that people that are around me don’t really enjoy it as much and often feel drained afterwards. For example I was at my friends house and we “argued” about cancel culture and whether or not you should separate the art from the artist. At the end she seemed rly demoralized and tied and I don’t rly know why, I understand how arguments can be tiring but this was a topic that didn’t rly affect her and that was rly random. And they’re not the only one. I’m constantly faced with people that don’t want to talk to me because I accidentally bring in values and ideologies into it. But I don’t know how to not since they are my main lens from which I see the world that I can’t just let go without completely shutting up. That’s why most of my “normal” conversations are often just small talk (that I don’t mind but that aren’t fulfilling enough) or just listening to the other person speak. So this is why I come here to ask for support and advice. Ik that this doesn’t rly have to do with anarchy but this is probably the only place that I feel comfortable enough to ask for help and that it’s part of learning about how to be an anarchist.\n\nI would also add that finding people that I could be able to talk to isn’t a option because I go to a small school where the most left leaning students there just think that everyone should be equal and that don’t think deeper into it. I have had very interesting conversations with teachers but usually I would rather not because of the power dynamic and how they talk as tho they are still teaching me rather than having an actual conversation. Also I’m very shy online compared to the real world since I don’t have the crutch of physical reactions to calm my anxieties.",

  "title": "For LWMAs or other market anarchists: Could Ostrom's rules allow for the establishment/stabilization of cartels?",
  "selftext": "So traditionally cartels are seen as unstable.\n\nThis is because of a collective action problem.\n\nBasically, while everyone in the cartel benefits from high prices, each member could benefit a little more by cutting their price a small amount and thereby getting all the customers. The other cartel members have to respond likewise, and this drives down the price. Couple that with artificially high prices attracting new competitors to the market, and the cartel is fundamentally unstable (more or less, there are exceptions).\n\nAnyways, I've gotten into Elinor Ostrom as of late and it occurred to me that her rules and commons management almost sound like a cartel. I mean you're limiting the supply of say, fish, for example. So like, each individual fisherman could benefit more by fishing for more fish, but if he did so he'd destroy the resource because it would drop fish to below healthy levels.\n\nBut limiting supply is what cartels do to raise prices right?\n\nSo like, could ostrom's rules be used to support cartel formation? Are there ways to counter that? I mean the higher prices would attract competitors still, but maybe they'd be incentivized to join the cartel since it is stable? In fairness there is a limit yo this process because there is a minimum each cartel member needs to produce in order to justify being in the cartel. But in order to keep prices the same supply has to be fixed so more cartel members = less supply per member. I'm not sure though, would love thoughts. Another interesting idea is that if Ostrom's rules can be used to form a cartel, then couldn't it also be used to form a counter cartel? So like, the denial of goods to the cartel by the most interest parties (i.e. a boycott or a refusal to supply a firm).\n\nCould Ostrom's rules be used for cartel formation? If so, how can this be prevented if at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm not sure this is guaranteed though.\n\nCause in order to keep prices high, you have to limit the supply in the market right?\n\nBut high prices attract new market entrants. And that means that you're going to end up in a situation where you are constantly attracting new people to the market, and in order to prevent them undercutting the cartel, you have to get them to join it, which then leads to a situation where you further have to limit supply otherwise the rewards of the cartel are going to be reduced the more people you have right? It's a catch 22. You reduce market supply to keep up high prices and rewards constant, but this attracts more people, meaning you have to further limit supply and raise prices. If you didn't do this, then new members to the cartel reduces rewards to cartel members and at a certain point defection is the better strategy because demand cannot keep up with the need to reduce supply and therefore raise price. I don't really see a way for cartels to be stable like that in the long term unless they are able to prevent market entry, which is basically impossible given the assumption of socialized capital and land (as we assume in any socialist environment)\n\nAt some point you'd have to limit the supply to such a degree that it is cheaper for consumers to make it themselves or there isn't sufficient demand to justify that supply right?\n\nAnd that's not to even mention the possibility of other workers forming a cartel to counter yours, limiting the supply they produce to account for the higher costs they incur. Or preventing you from accessing their labor and its products.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut yeah, it's an interesting thought experiment. Are there other approaches I am missing?",

I think it would be cool to set up an autonomous community in a rural/semi-rural area or brownfield site, which people could live on for free in return for simple engagement in building, cooking, cleaning and other basic voluntary chores.\n\nWhile this may not be particularly 'revolutionary' in the literal sense, it can offer some opportunities to challenge or disengage with the system, for example building your own simple housing would mean refusing the forced systemic dichotomy of having to accept either extortionate rent or an equally extortionate mortgage commitment, thus circumventing the whole shitty commodified property system. \n\nPeople could still have jobs or whatever if it could be near enough to a given town/city to pay for basics like food, but it would allow for an alternative autonomous existence outside of that. Such a community could be promoted via social media or other means to further the popularity and values of anarchist principles and practice.\n\nThere is plenty of public rural land close to towns where this would potentially be viable without automatic forced eviction, and people have set up communities like this before, such as gypsy and Roma groups\n\n.Anyway, I dunno how popular these ideas would be with people on here, but it would be doing something, even if it doesn't make much of a difference on a macro-scale. The Zapatistas haven't had a huge impact on global politics, but what they did was nonetheless arguably good and important to the movement.",

They said that anarchists are simply reactionaries; that they have bought into CIA propaganda about the history of communism and spend more energy attacking communists than they do attacking actual fascists.\n\nThe anarchists have said that it is hard not to hate on communists because communists have killed anarchists, for no reason, every time they gain power, and have used the state apparatus to engage in what they call \"red fascism\". They said specifically that Marxist-Leninists are authoritarian and act in contradiction to what Marx initially thought about the state. \n\nSo what does history actually say about this? Did anarchists try undermine the revolution, or did communists oppress and kill anarchists. Or is there a little bit of truth in both points of view? And more in general, can this in-fighting between leftists' biggest camps ever be tempered? Is that something we should even strive for, or is infighting the sign of a healthy and developing ideology and necessary to find what is true?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the detailed answers and the lack of talking down to this \"big C communist.

  "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI personally believe that every anarchist should read Ostrom's Work \"Governing the Commons\". I read it a year or so ago and am planning to read it again. It is utterly fascinating and a great example of self-management and showing that the so called \"tragedy of the commons\" is not inevitable and the justification for private property can easily fall apart. Ostrom herself wasn't an explicit leftist or anything (though I think she grew more sympathetic as she got older), but I sincerely believe every radical should read her work because it is probably the best window we have into what anarchist organization would look like in the world we wish to build.\n\nSimping aside, her focus was primarily on CPRs (Common Pool Resources). CPRs are rivalrous but non-exlcusive, (if I catch a fish you cannot catch that same fish. But it's very difficult for me to prevent you from also using the lake to fish).\n\nShe laid out 8 key principles for commons management which can be found here:\n\n[https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons/index.html](https://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/elinor-ostroms-8-principles-managing-commmons/index.html)\n\nHowever the one relevant to this post is the first one.\n\n1. Define clear group boundaries.\n\nNot all commons can have clear boundaries. For example, human knowledge can be treated like a common resource. There is a given cost to produce it (i.e. labor-time, resources, etc) but once produced anyone can use it and it's hard to prevent its spread. This can lead to a free-rider issue as people under-allocate labor or resources to it in order in the hopes other people make up the slack. Another example is fishing on the high seas. While local fisheries can be managed quite well because its boundaries are clear (like, people tend to know what the boundaries of a lake are) it's a lot harder to understand the boundaries of the literal ocean right? And it sure as hell is hard to exclude someone from using the ocean and so i'm not really sure where the boundary is? Open source software is another example.\n\nThis first rule is the one I have the biggest trouble with. The rest I am on board for.\n\nSo, are there works/resources describing how to manage the commons when clear boundaries don't exist or are very hard to define? Where can I read more about how to take ostromian ideas and apply that to boundaryless commons?",

That is not meant to be in bad faith I just can’t think of the proper phrasing for that question.",

Along with the rest of Chiapas, which remains the poorest state of Mexico, the EZLN communities have been dragged by the global capitalist crisis into the same storm of violence, repression, persistent deprivation and outward migration...  \n>  \n>In a series of communiqués, it announced that, except for existing private plots, Zapatista land will become “non-property” or “common land” which explicitly will not be “ejidos”, a traditional form of communal ownership of the land combined with individual use of a few hectares at a time. Instead, it will be open for cultivation by non-Zapatistas, including several hectares for “national and international civil society.” The plan is for so-called Local Autonomous Governments (GAL) to manage these properties.  \n>  \n>Removing the empty tag lines, this is a plan to set up a political structure that will encourage outside investors and increase proceeds for the Zapatista leadership, which already taxes individuals and imposes a 10 percent tax of agricultural income of families, according to a leaked military report. Among other initiatives to reach out to non-Zapatistas, their plan can be summed up as, “If you can’t beat them, join them”...  \n>  \n>El Pais reported leaked internal documents of the Mexican military showing an even greater surveillance of the EZLN than the drug cartels, with one military report from January 2020 discarding any danger to the Tren Maya project, concluding that the EZLN simply does not have the resources to oppose it.   \n>  \n>The EZLN leadership however has responded by isolating itself further and making appeals to the same capitalist government to defend it.

One question that goes through my mind is: what are the motivations for anarchism? I’m not necessarily asking: what are the differences in different approaches, but rather—why do folks gravitate towards anarchism as a worldview or as a political theory?\n\nI pose this question to you all. \n\nIt seems to me, though, that many reasons abound: from the sheer contradiction in having enough resources in this world so no one goes hungry, to the vast inequities perpetuated by Capitalism, to the lunacy in enacting policies that affect certain populations while purposefully neglecting their input, to the fact that many, if not all reasonably minded human beings, value freedom and yet we live in a society that not only frustrates these freedoms, but suppresses them for the sake of a small minority. \n\nMy own motivation for considering anarchism has to do with observed patterns in decision-making, be it in healthcare (at the bedside), politics, religion or economics. The pattern, which I take to be harmful, is the desire to appeal to dogma and authority, out of which all power and decision-making must flow. More broadly, or epistemically, it’s about the desire for a foundation that serves as a basis for knowledge and action. As someone who grew up in a strict religious household, who has witnessed medical paternalism in action, who has seen public health policy (drafted by a select few) impact populations that are the least well off among us, who has witnessed the blind appeal to dogmas in science, I think anarchism serves as a powerful framework for interrogating this pattern. At the very least, it’s the reason I started reading more about it.\n\nAnyway, I’m curious to see everyone’s responses!",

Also does that not seem like just hijacking a social movement that's already based around that minorities interest's, like if it's a capitalist minority sure go for it (you'll struggle forming and then maintaining any form of control as an Anarchist in a capitalist movement obviously due to pushback, keep up the fight though!!) but what about if it's let's say...a black-led racial abolitionist group and a bunch of white anarchist's show up and begin to deflect from racial issues and discrimination in favour of other issue's.\n\nI understand Anarchism is anti-authority and therefore anti-racist but not even anarchist's are free from various forms of bias (example is about racial bias but it could be gender bias, age bias, class bias etc.) especially when we live in racist societies of varying degrees, depending on social and cultural attitudes and norms.\n\nThat's also what baffled me about the Platformist principles, if everyone has to hold the same theory and praxis, what if that theory and praxis is problematic? So surely not everyone SHOULD hold the same theory and praxis then because otherwise you'd have a hivemind mentality and there wouldn't be a point in aiming to reach consensus in the first place.\n\nAlso, collective responsibility seems a tad odd to me, idk-just seems as though if a member of the organisation was a new member let's say and they went on to commit a problematic action none of us knew they would commit, why should I be responsible for that person's actions rather than them having to take personal responsibility for their own actions while maintaining critical thinking skills?

  "title": "Markets and Enterprises",
  "selftext": "Recently I've been more and more interested in market forms of socialism. Here are a few ideas I've been having, and I ask of you to point out their shortcomings, share your perspectives, and point me to resources where these ideas have already been explored, because I'm sure they're not original.\n\n  \nFirst, where I'm coming from. I believe in justice and oppose injustice, everyone does :) Injustice I define as the act of taking advantage of someone, having them do something for you, while disregarding their own interests. On the opposite, doing something altruistically is good, and everything in between is neutral.\n\nTo cut a long story short, the reasons why capitalism is unjust are as follows:\n\n\\- Absolute private property is theft - you can't just claim something for yourself, like a piece of land or an idea. The notion of property is useful most of the time and should be respected, but should never be absolute. On the opposite, taking peoples toothbrushes will sow distrust and should be avoided.\n\n\\- Most modern companies are authoritarian in their structure, where lower ranks have no influence on the trajectory the company takes. And while this isn't morally good or bad in itself, authoritarianism structurally incentivises injustice, besides also alienating the lower ranks.\n\n\\- The concept of publicly traded companies with shareholders incentivises management to take advantage of the society at large in order to grow in times of bull market, as well as take advantage of their own employees in times of bear market.\n\n\\- Money=influence, which incentivises elected representatives to represent those with money as opposed to their own constituents.\n\nThese are the main ones. Now what do we do with that information, how do we construct a society that will structurally reward justice?\n\nCapitalism is a system in which people with money and influence use them to get even more money and influence through the medium of the market. So let's critically examine money and the market.\n\nI believe in David Graeber's position (at the risk of misrepresenting it) that money is a recorded, formal account of debt. And the need for money is in reverse proportional to the amount of trust between people. Here are a few examples:\n\n\\- Between close friends and within a family money is not needed. If you make a favor for somebody, informal debt is placed on the other party, and you expect them to pay it back in more or less equal amount. Issues arise when more than two people are involved - if person A made a favor for person B, person B to person C, how can person A expect that person C then makes a favor for them? If he reasonably could, that would be actual communism.\n\n\\- If you have no trust with the other party, you can only record debt in a medium that is in itself self-evidently valuable - like gold or silver. Gold and silver historically have been in most demand in times of war and crisis, where you can't trust in the value of anything else.\n\n\\- If you have no trust in the other party, but you both have trust in a third party, you can hand over the gold and silver (self-evidently valuable items) to them, have that party issue convertible bank notes, and exchange those. If a crisis arises that disturbs your faith - you can get the gold and silver back.\n\n\\- If this arrangement lasts for a while and you don't expect a crisis in the future - you can omit the deposition of valuables and just deal in banknotes without backing. That is the highest form of trust achieveable between parties short of pure informal debt.\n\nBecause money is an expression of debt, debt is integral to interpersonal relationships, and exchange of money for goods and services constitutes the market, I do believe that a market is inherent to societies. The question then becomes, how do we create such a market that structurally rewards justice, unlike capitalism, which does the opposite.\n\nFirst of all, I'm in favor of real, actual communism - and I have shown that this kind of communism requires absolute trust between people. This is not achieveable overnight, so we need a market that structurally rewards trust, which will both lead to communism in the future, and when conflicts arise and people stop trusting each other, will provide a fallback option, that will overtime, again, lead to communism.\n\nSecond of all, markets should be free, because monopolistic tendencies incentivise injustice. Different kinds of goods and services by their nature have a degree of natual monopolicity to them, and in such cases formal processes should be devised to fairly evaluate the available options and choose the best one. This in itself requires trust - both for the companies to follow the process, and the customers to participate in it.\n\nThird, I believe that there should be mulitple currencies allowed as legal tender. A currency is an expression of trust in the issuing institution, so why would I use one that I personally don't have a reason to trust? This introduces logistical issues, but I feel this idea is worth investigating.\n\nFourth, how do we structure companies in a way that structurally rewards justice? Companies are collections of people and resources that provide a desireable product or service. Companies are also inherent to society - people constantly come together to achieve something. And on the one hand, company as a whole should respect the interests of every participant. On the other, if the company mission changes - structural changes are necessary, new departments should be created and staffed, old ones - disbanded, people fired. Won't democracy get in the way of this?\n\nI believe that this question should also be viewed through the lens of trust. I, as a regular worker, should not be expected to elect the company leader - I have no reason to trust him or have a way to evaluate his performance. I do have a reason to trust my colleagues - we are doing the same type of work, and I can compare myself to them, identifying the freeloaders and firing them. I also can elect my immediate manager - I interact with him daily and can evaluate his performance. Same goes for him - that gives us a basis for negotiating our salaries.\n\nBut how should departments interact? Should low-level team leaders elect department heads? Or should department heads appointed from above decide which teams they need, and which teams are redundant - and should be disbanded and fired. I believe that team department heads should be appointed - companies should in their essense be mission-oriented, and with that come top-down assignments - but departments themselves should be independent contractors - with them possibly offering their services to multiple different companies, negotiating their pay with each. This way, I believe, the level of expected trust between colleagues is natural, and in places where trust is not to be expected, the market will do the negotiating work to arrive at a fair compensation.\n\nThere is also the problem of the functions of the state - administration of justice, security, possibly other things. The state can be viewed as an inherently monopolistic company and treated as such. But honestly idk, I'd like to hear your opinions on this.\n\nSo, what do you all think? Also, sorry for \"he\" pronouns for gender-neutral terms - this is just my habit.",

I understand the notions of mutual aid and deconstruction of power imbalances thru either the means of revolution or evolution but when it comes to big picture conversations I'm a bit confused and have a few questions. \n\nBorders- I'm American but I'm aware that national borders can be open ended as many European borders where one can roam freely and might just need a passport or ID. This is normal. But if there was an anarchist social structure to take the place where the US once stood I can only assume that the borders would remain. So how would we maintain or negate certain boundaries between an anarchist structure and a nation that has conflicting policies. Would we even be considered a country in their eyes? (It would be super cool if both Mexico and Canada were chill about lax borders but I know that our borders also extend to the oceans and skies for defense, trade and travel)  \n\nNational Security- I've always hated the military state entirely I detest it, but the problem remains that there are going to be nations with conflict of interest, or nations that might even view the rebuilding of an anarchist society as a power vacuum (especially if the transfer of power is violent or extremely sudden) to exploit? \n\nLarge scale governing- I would assume that it would be democratic, hopefully with an informed and educated voter population with actual weight to the polls but how would we keep national affairs transparent? The only thing I can think of is live broadcasting but that might be unnerving or dangerous when it comes to decisions on foreign policy. If the system decides on some sort of overall democratic mediation what would be the deciding factors? How to we keep conversations on international and interior issues in the hands of the people while also keeping open a direct line of communication for movement, be that defense or aid? \n\nThank you for reading up to this point.

But ive watched a few hours worth of interviews with him. As far as I'm aware this is his theory. Although id highly recommend researching more as im no expert.\n\nAs a very, very high level conceptual explanation: (edit drippywaffle) \n\n1. In feudal times wealth and power was concentrated in the hands of people who **rented** (lords who owned land just expropriating 30-50% of the harvest of a peasant). \n\n2. With the industrial revolution wealth and power shifted to those who owned businesses and factories and used wage labour to create things that were sold on a market for **profit.**\n\n3. With the advent of platforms like Amazon, Apple Store, Uber, etc labourers (like on Uber) and \"vassal capitalists\" (like on Amazon, Apple Store) **rent** space on these platforms to access consumers, which aren't traditional markets (he gives the example of walking down a High Street where they can custom price everything, all the buildings are owned by one guy, and he gets to choose what businesses you see). \n\n4. As these \"techno-feudalists\" are gaining more power they will displace the traditional capitalists for top dog, completing the transition. As he pointed out, there were capitalist entities in feudal times, it only became capitalism when the balance of power shifted. \n\n5. We are now also doing free labour as serfs to try and boost our own standing (linkedin, facebook, youtube) for getting hired, which creates 100% of the content for those sites, which is a kind of serfdom. Cloud capital as the OP mentioned. \n\n6. As a final bit of info, since 2008 profit has not been so important as there is a constant stream of central bank money to keep the economy on a drip feed, meaning turning a profit is not as important. \n\nI think it's an interesting idea and good for understanding the current paradigm.\n\nEdit: For an even more simplified description, it's the Apple App Store taking 30% of revenue from all sales like a lord takes 30% of grain from a peasant farmer, in both cases for the honour of being on their platform/land, rather than creating a product/service and selling it for a profit in a market like a industrial factory making toothbrushes or app developer making Angry Birds.",

I saw online discussion in group that claims to be anarchist, where some people claimed, that anarchism never succeeds thanks to people that are not dogmatically anti-state. \n\nFor context, post was about city's public transport and people that do not pay for their tickets. Public transport in this case is financed mainly from city's budget (70%) and tickets (30%). City budget is mostly financed from local taxes. City eventually decided to send demand for payments to free riders that did not want to pay for it for years.\n\nSo, I don't find dogmatism appealing. For me, dogmatism can contribute to environment conductive for microfascism. I can understand why some people see any form of statism as wrong, but on the other hand, what is end goal for anarchism? Isn't it intellectually lazy to just say \"fight the system\" and treat it as axiom in every possible situation? Isn't it in the end about people's well-being? \n\nIf people pay indirectly for something and you say \"fuck the system\" to justify stealing from them, then how does it makes it different from dogmatic communists that commit genocides, because for them, the end justifies the means? \n\nFor me it makes sense to focus on oppressive parts of the system and fight them, but that's it.

  "selftext": "So a little while when I was really getting into Warren, I was worried about a specific issue. If price = cost = wage + input costs, then the introduction of a labor saving technology could result in the reduction in consumption power of a worker. A reduction in labor cost means a reduction in take home pay (as disutility has now decreased). While yes this means price falls and demand rises, and there is a general price decrease across the economy, it is possible that the demand increase will not be enough to compensate for the lost income. This is a niche scenario, but one that concerned me. \r  \n\r  \nBut thanks to some conversations with other anarchists I realized I had forgotten about the increase in social profit. There will be a general decrease in prices (which still may not be enough in the short term). This means that the worker will be able to get training on other kinds of work more cheaply or just buy the production facilities needed to produce the level of consumption they were at previously, and therefore are still better off (in the long term) because a portion of that social profit is reinvested in them. In short, the general decrease in prices (i.e. increase in social profit) makes it easier to acquire the MOP needed to produce the previous goods the worker was consuming or to acquire skills needed to produce something else with higher disutility.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBut that got me thinking: What are the other ways social profit could be reinvested? There isn't a central controller or anything, so there's clearly going to be a self-organized line of thought in social profit reinvestment. What do you think are the best things that social profit could be spent on, and how do we best structure how it is reinvested? I'm also curious, do you think I am right about the worker who lost out wages because of cheaper labor being better off because of social profit reinvestment in the way I described?

Let's say, for sake of discussion, this Anarchist society runs on a gift economy because that's something I atleast have a small grasp on at the moment.\n\nLets say, you wanted a t-shirt. You go to the local tailor shop, and ask for a t-shirt. Now, making one shirt is a pretty long process. You have to get the right fabric depending on the order, and use the right tools. All these require a long logistic chain to meet demand. \n\nMy point is, to produce a shirt, a tailor would be have to go through many obstacles to be able to produce one shirt. So how would this tailor meet demand, when all of the producers that make this job of producing shirts possible? Like a farmer who produces wool. This farmer has to go through the same struggle of getting the right materials to make their farm run properly. \n\nWithout the massive supply chain that monopolies have in a capitalist society, that makes the mass production of products easy.

Alternatively I hear about decentralized planned economies basically working by dividing up a country into counties and replicating the centrally planned model on a smaller scale, with planning agencies trading between them according to need, and that's just a market economy no? Except now it exists solely between planning agencies and not individuals.\n\nSo like, what distinguishes de-centrally planned economies from market economies? How do they operate differently?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy current economic vision is basically individuals forming free associations based on shared interests and negotiation between these different associations. I am not sure if this is a market or planned system as it kinda has elements of both? I'm not really sure.\n\nLike, as an example (and take it for granted that everyone controls that which they operate, i.e. the MOP are owned by the workers working them):\n\nSay i live in a village and we want electricity. However we don't know how to operate or build a power plant, but we do know how to grow wheat. As it happens, other communities want wheat as well so we have established connections with them.\n\nAnyways we find someone who knows how to build a power plant. We give him labor-pledges such that the cost of our labor-pledges = the cost of his labor (again labor cost differs depending on the job). Although he himself may not need wheat, someone in our network does and we have given him a pledge to do labor so he can use that to trade with others in the network who may need wheat.\n\nHe builds the plant and then we find others to operate it. We strike a similar ongoing deal with people who know how to operate the plant, so they get labor pledges which can be used in the rest of the network or directly redeemed by the community.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nImagine an economy that more or less works like that.\n\nThere are elements of a planned economy: namely the free association of consumers, the free association of workers operating the plant and both negotiating to establish a production plan that works for both. But there's also market elements like currency circulation and credit (which is effectively what a labor pledge is).\n\nThis idea also sounds very similar to Pat Devine's Negotiated Coordination which he holds up as explicitly not market socialist and is on the wikipedia page for a decentralized planned economy.\n\nSo I don't really know.

  "title": "Anarchism in poor countries",
  "selftext": "I was wondering if an anarchist movement got popular in a poor country, how would the process of its implementation, roughly speaking, unfold or even begin. The reason I'm asking this is that the whole process seems to be more difficult to implement in poor than in developed countries. I'm from Bosnia,  a poor country in Southeastern Europe. What I'm going to say applies overall to almost all post-socialist European countries and probably to many others on other continents.   \nWe have suffered an incredible brain drain over the last three decades. We are in deep trouble. Rural areas and even a lot of towns are suffering from a lack of doctors, engineers, teachers etc. There have recently been news for example, about how doctors don't want to go to some of these rural areas even when offered a pretty good salary. We are indebting ourselves to pay out even the goddamn pensions and salaries.   \nThere's shit ton of people who live in poverty, both employed and unemployed. So, I was wondering, if a bit prolonged transition phase would be necessary or something. If the state gets abolished very soon after a hypothetical coup, revolution or even elections, doesn't matter, a lot of people would find themselves in a terrible situation. Cutting the current welfare the state provides, however bad it might be, would just push people who are already recieving it into even more trouble. A lot of pensioners here live alone too and they would be hit pretty hard as well. Other people, even those who have somewhat decent standard of living would find it difficult to help all those in need. I think that for all reasons mentioned, getting things moving again, creating jobs etc. would be incredibly difficult.  \nSo what should be done, in broader terms, if such hypothetical case of an anarchist takeover takes place, to minimize authoritarian practices overall, deal with the money system and try to prevent things sliding into a poverty hell hole for a lot of people. Or is it even smart to go into all of this in a small, import dependent and depopulated country at all if things on a global scale remain as if they've been for the last let's say 35 years with all the imperialism stuff going on?",

Does the anarchist movement fight against it across time? is this a liberal or social democrat thing only? i already saw Marxists wanting gun control even with the \"under no pretext\" thing that Marx said himself, how did the usual left movement get into the gun control side and the right became the pro-gun? and what anarchists were doing about this political change across the evolution of political debate in the past decades?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: i think i expressed myself wrong, i know anarchists don't advocate for gun control because that would make no sense, but how they handled the change of positions of the leftist movement from leftist pro-gun to pro-control, seeing that it changed across history?",

  "selftext": "What I mean by this is that is there any other way to critique and/or negatively view civilization without being totally at a loss for the possibility of positive human development?\n\nFor context: I work as an employee at a cooperative bakery, only about half of the staff are co-owners though, and sure it's a nice work environment but it's not like material conditions are drastically better for me. Plus all of my bosses are vaguely anti-capitalist themselves which honestly feels worse. For a while I really wanted to believe if more cooperative development started taking place we'd be a lot better off. And maybe we would. But at least at other jobs you know your boss is a boss outright and they don't try to convince you they're a \"good\" boss.\n\nI just feel like being a boss rots your brain. And it would be nice if the productive forces of society that feed, clothe, and house people no longer had to be done like this anymore. But a realistic outlook of the world imo shows that societies will continue industrializing to their detriment. Even if state socialist societies could aim for a better trajectory with all this it still feels like nothing will be done in time before most people will bear the weight of civil downfall.\n\nSo I can't really see how someone could happily be anti-civ and preach its cause to others without the implication of being a nihilist or wanting other people to be nihilistic too. Granted if I can come to good terms as to why I would consider myself a nihilist, I would. But I dislike how the \"destructive urge is also a creative urge\" group promotes how they have no clue what they actaully want besides \"not this\". It just would be nice to have a positive program for change and actually not see the world in this way if I could avoid it but it's hard.",

  "selftext": "A quote from Cory Doctorow ([source](https://doctorow.medium.com/gig-work-is-the-opposite-of-steampunk-463e2730ef0d)):\n\n“A craft worker enjoys enormous autonomy. If they get a cramp or need a bathroom break, they can just stop. If they’re hungry, they can eat. If the landscape outside the window is looking especially picturesque, they can stop and contemplate it... *Even the most labor-friendly, cooperatively owned assembly line can’t function if its workers do their own thing*. The price of factory efficiency is autonomy: a worker in a multi-stage process has other workers upstream and downstream depending on them to maintain the pace and regimentation of the line.” \n\nI think what distinguishes a factory from craft labor, and what makes it objectionable, is mass production of homogenous goods to meet a quota or maximize output. This demands strict scheduling and oversight.\n\n **I’m not saying this is impossible without the hierarchies of modern society**. There’s lots of successful agricultural projects and factories brought up here that are more egalitarian. I’m asking: **can it be done while fully respecting the autonomy of all the participants? If not, can anarchist movements make use of factories as a means to an end?** \n\nThis question is relevant, because while modern production practices are excessive and wasteful, anarchist regions might benefit from some things being produced at scale, e.g. bullets and drugs. For things like this, a decrease in output to allow for more relaxed factory work days could be harmful to the consumers.",

  "title": "How would Anarchists handle closing down collectives?",
  "selftext": "Hi! I was reading An Anarchist FAQ, and I have some questions about the functioning of the economy in anarchism. Sorry if I'm misunderstanding anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  What would happen to the assets of closed-down collectives?   \nLike if say some factories and shops will have to be closed down because of a large drop in demand, or a miscalculated investment resulting in massive overproduction, or some other such crisis, big enough that they can't just reduce hours, and some factories and shops will have to close. What would happen to the assets afterwards?  \nIn Mutualism,\\* it seems simple to me, because it would be a lot like the situation of the Mondragon Coop in 2013, when one of the members, FAGOR, was closed because there just wasn't much demand in the market during the recession, and they kept running at a loss, so the general assembly voted to deny FAGOR more credit and let it go bankrupt because they feared that it would drag the whole federation down with it from the sheer expense. The workers were helped by the federation, with early retirement pay, relocation to other coops, etc, while FAGOR's assets were sold off to other companies to pay off it's debt to the Caja Laboral credit union. Under Mutualism, unless something is very different, I would assume that it would be a similar process unless the confederation votes to do something different with the assets. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  \nBut in Anarchist Communism and Collectivism,\\*\\* the assets are the property of all of society, not owned just by the workers who work there, so how would the assets be dealt with? Would they just be divvied up to other collectives that the confederation decides needs them?  \n\n2. How would economic planning be done in anarchist societies?  \n(This one's not about the Mutualists BTW.)  \nI've read *FAQ*, and as I understand it, economic planning in an anarchist society basically consists of trying to collect information about demand (whether it be through councils of economy, or communes, statistical commissions, etc), and then the confederations of collectives will try and plan out the investments to different collectives to try and meet the needs of the people. But then the collectives act autonomously, trading with each other freely, without the sort of Soviet-style commands, ie: \"*You will get 10 tons of coal from company A, and 40 tons of Iron Ore from company B, and you will produce 30 tons of Iron to sell to company C...\"*  \nIt's not like that at all right? They plan out the investments, (either in labor notes, or directly with labor and raw materials), and then from there on out, they interact autonomously, doing whatever they need to, as long as they try and fulfill the plan.  \nAm I understanding things correctly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Yes, I know Mutualism doesn't mean \"Market Anarchism,\" that it just means \"Anarchism tolerant of markets,\" but I'm talking about a Mutualist coop that is operating in a market here, so just humor me for a moment please. You don't need to explain it to me again.\n\n\\*\\*I'm using Collectivism here because I saw it in *FAQ.* I understand that it's not really popular at all in anarchism today, so can anyone explain why Iain Mckay is using it there, and why he explains stuff like investment funds and the like in such detail? Is it still popular in some form, or is it part of a sort of Malatesta-style \"there will be a mix of systems at first,\" sort of thing going on here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

  "selftext": "This is something I have been thinking about a lot lately. I have noticed that the general consensus in leftist or anarchist circles is that science is objectively factual and should not be questioned. I would agree that properly designed, properly conducted, independent study is indeed objectively factual. But how do we really know what is independent study in the context of capitalism and government? Capitalist forces could of course bribe scientists to do their bidding. Government forces could censor, threaten, or even murder scientists who go digging where they aren't supposed to. It's pretty easy to determine what type of science could be influenced by capitalism, just follow the money. I doubt there is a whole bunch of independent scientific study on topics that multi-billion dollar industries could benefit from. These industries have the money to make scientists do whatever they want, or even kill scientists who won't do what they want. It's well known that the CIA has carried out assassinations in foreign countries at the behest of giant corporations. Do we not think they would do that in our own country? Of course they would, we just wouldn't hear about it on the news. Even if a topic doesn't have money behind it, who knows what the government does or doesn't want us to see. If they didn't want us to see some science, I don't think we would end up seeing it. We probably only get to see what they want us to see. If someday, there was a world without capitalism or government, I would be very trusting of science, but until that day, I will remain very skeptical and open minded. What's everyone else's thoughts on this?",

  "selftext": "Here's something I see a lot that I'm not understanding. I see a lot of anarchists talking about harm reduction as justification for things like voting. I don't see how this is really compatible with anarchism. If people took real steps to free ourselves from government and capitalism, it would be the complete opposite of short-term harm reduction. Harm would be massively increased in the short-term, and many people would not survive. We would have to accept the short-term harm to maybe have a better world in the long term. Realistically, there will never be a peaceful transition away from government and capitalism. Governments will fight to the death to prevent that. If your main concern is short-term harm reduction, you might as well just be a democratic socialist or whatever. And even then, how much harm reduction are you really getting from voting? Seems like a very minimal amount if any. Here in the US, both parties are currently supporting a genocide in Gaza. Both parties support genocide, endless war, mass incarceration, the police state, and capitalism. I just don't see why anarchists should even be thinking about short-term harm reduction. It seems like a distraction to me. Maybe this is an accelerationist point of view, but it seems to me like we should be more focused on the long-term goals, and we would have to be willing to accept major harm in the short-term. There will be no peaceful transition away from the system we are currently living in. So why should we even be thinking about harm reduction in the short term? And even if voting did significantly reduce harm, which I don't believe it does, would you not be ultimately supporting the system that you are opposed to? Why even participate in voting when you are supporting genocide no matter who you vote for? I can't even stomach voting after watching this bipartisan support for genocide.",

If a person is in psychosis/ a different mental state and would be deemed to need help by the majority of people but they themself don’t think they need help (as a lot of instances of psychosis could manifest), would Berkman think involuntary treatment would be justified?\n6.

We could attribute this need for violence as a result of imprisonment for example. As a lot of people who have been incarcerated are recidivists.

  "title": "Anarchist Econ: How do we best respond to demand shocks?",
  "selftext": "\nOk, so this is a rather technical question, as such this is rather long, so sorry for that in advance.\n\nAlright so here's the specific problem I am thinking about.\n\nWithin an anarchist economy (for our sake we'll assume a gift economy), the basic idea is as follows:\n\n\nYou give without expectation of immediate reward. The reason that I do this is because I know that I will get my needs met by someone else within out gift economy network later on done the line. But I only get those desires/needs met if I contribute here and now (necessities are a given, they will always be met. But most people want more than just necessities right? So if I want those non-necessities I have to contribute to the community otherwise they won't give them to me).\n\nOk, that's the basic idea yeah? If we want to mathematically model this, we can basically say that Consumption (C) <= Production (P). You have to add as much or more than you consume otherwise others won't be inclined to give you stuff. And that also ensures the long term sustainability of your gift economy (if consumption > production for extended periods of time, the whole thing will eventually run out of resources and collapse, this is part of the issue with capitalism).\n\nOk, so then the most common objection raised is: not all labor is equal, why would I do very unpleasant labor if I can get the same luxuries as someone who is doing comparatively pleasant labor (so, like, why would I clean a sewer if I can sit in a nice air conditioned office and do paper work?)? We will call the unpleasantness of labor \"disutility\" (borrowing from econ). Cleaning a sewer is high disutility, working in an office is low disutility (comparatively at least). My basic assumption moving forward is that people want to minimize disutility (this means minimize unpleasantness of work basically).\n\n\nThe answer that i have found in most anarchist circles is the distribution of luxuries and priorities may vary depending on the distuility of different types of labor. Basically, a higher number of hours of average disutility labor is equal to 1 hour of high-disutilty labor, and so C and P are no longer solely determined by the objective time measurement that went into production/consumption.\n\nSo if your job requires lots of training/education (like being a doctor) that is a higher disutility and as such will be compensated by higher priority for luxuries. (So for example, a doctor may be the first in line to get the biggest house on the block, or maybe they're first in line at the communal kitchen, etc). Alternatively, resources are allocated to make high disutility have a lower disutility (so the doctor gets extra help instead of having to do it all themselves, that sorta thing).\n\nThat's all fine and dandy. But that leads us to an interesting problem (the topic of this post): What happens when those who do high-disutility labor have a higher degree of bargaining power over the rest of the community?\n\n\nSay that there's a sudden disease and the demand for doctors rises rapidly. This means that individual doctors are in a better bargaining position and may demand more priorities/advantages in exchange for the same amount of labor.\n\n\nWhile it is true that doctors have access to as much luxuries as they need because they can just get them from the broader gift network, the issue is the ratio of their labor to other labor that is necessary to achieve those luxuries.\n\nSo to make this problem clearer, I will use math.\n\nL_d = Labor-time of the doctor or other high disutility worker.\n\nL_s = standard labor-time, just some standard unit used to measure average disutility labor for the rest of the community.\n\n\nSo before a sudden demand shock we have:\n\nL_s/L_d = x where x is some constant that was negotiated upon between the doctor and community. x represents the ratio of the doctor's labor to the community's labor that is necessary in order for the doctor to receive the higher priority in luxuries and whatnot.\n\n\nAfter the shock:\n\nL_s/L_d = y where y > x and L_d remains constant\n\n\nWhat this means is that L_s has risen, i.e. the rest of the community must do more work to receive the same level of labor from the doctor. This happens not because the doctor wants more luxuries, but because the doctor wants to minimize the amount of work they do and maximize their own consumption (i.e. min(P) and max(C)). So for less work they can consume as much as before basically. This is obviously not ideal.\n\nNow long term this will stabilize, because the higher L_s/L_d will attract other people to that particular line of work and therefore decrease the bargaining power of the doctor which drives the ratio back down until it is at x or lower. But the fundamental question remains: What about the interim? During the demand shock?\n\nHow do we properly prevent a rise in L_s/L_d? We could deny the doctor access to luxuries that he needs, but that also means that we're denied access to the doctor right? Long term that's not gonna be great for anyone right?\n\n\nWe could kick the doctor out of the commune after the shock as well. Or we could look for other doctors.\nBut are there other solutions? Are there other ways to prevent the doctor from raising that ratio or removing the incentive to do so? Because the incentive lies in a desire to minimize labor.\n\nI suppose what we could do is maintain a low ratio, z, where z < x and then in the future when the demand shock is lower, we can up that ratio to y temporarily as repayment for taking a lower ratio when needed. That could potentially work as it fits with labor minimization.\n\nAnother approach is requiring the doctor train others so that their negotiating power is lower.\n\nAny other approaches? What do you think is best?\n\nEdit:\n\nI do think there's potentially a case to be made that the higher y is justifiable in certain circumstances because a demand shock may entail more actual labor done (if a deadly virus is going around doctors may have to work more. This means more hours which increases the average overall disutility). This means each hour may have to have a higher ratio in order to compensate for the greater overall disutility\n\n\nSo to give a numeric example:\n\nLet's day our doctor is working 10 hour days normally and at a ratio of 2/1, i.e. x = 2. Disutility per hour is not constant, the first hour of a work day is a lot more pleasant than the last. So let's say the average disutility is about 30 utils. This means an average of 3 utils/hour.\n\nOk so now our doctor faces a demand shock. This increases his work hours to 15 a day. This has a dramatic increase in overall disutility both from the increased stress of a pandemic and from the higher hours,  leading to 600 utils over the day. 600/15 = 4 utils per hour.\n\nSo if x was 2 when utils/hour was 3 then perhaps y should be 3 when utils/hour is 4 right?\n\nHell even if we keep the hours the same this problem could still happen solely from stress of dealing with a pandemic right? So if we kept 10 hours but upped the disutility to 100 utils. Then we have 10 utils/hour right? And that's much higher than 3.

Of course, the nature of how better they are is like being given the option to be imprisoned your whole life vs being in imprisoned your whole life, but you also get a window to see out of. That seems like a notable distinction. \n\nI do not see electoralism as a way out of our current hellscape, however i see it as something that can be done alongside more meaningful steps towards something better for everyone. plus, it really doesn't take much effort at all to vote, though i know this is not a universal truth and i am certainly privileged in my state for having ease of voting. \n\nI was previously fairly sympathetic/convinced of the voting doesn't matter perspective, until a very simple thing was put to me: a trans person said something along the lines of \"repubs are ferociously anti trans/lgbt, dems are bad but less bad obviously, so vote\", and frankly this seems obvious. I don't get why people defend their decision to not vote. \n\nAlso, i understand some arguments against voting, such as that it isn't truly consensual, and that the both parties are terrible so why bother. \n\nBut i just think that it's a matter of weighing the pros and cons, and while each has a laundry list of cons and virtually no pros, the voting option in the case of voting blue is more likely to yield one less terrible con. \n\nbut yeah, i am open minded and almost want to be persuaded, but i feel like i can't honestly say i have a good response to the idea that not voting will be bad for lgbt people, as well as in ways bad for all marginalized people. \n\nI could see a new wave of fascist chest pumping and therefore violence in response to the celebration following a trump victory.

Therefore, they are more responsible utilizing their power for the greater good of their nation than an autocrat who is in a constant struggle to expand and keep their power.\n\nThat's the basics of their philosophy and I'm really interested in hearing an anarchists position on monarchy in detail. \n\nPersonally, I much rather prefer that the people rule themselves than having a monarch call the shots.",

Why would an egoist want to convince other people of egoism? Wouldn't it be easier to mislead and manipulate people who aren't egoist and wouldn't that be more beneficial to the egoist?\n2. How does egoism deal with having a long term conception or ideal of your self? Stirner seems to say that we should accept others and ourselves as we come instead of comparing ourselves to some ideal and that we shouldn't deny ourselves in pursuit of this ideal. How does this apply to long term goals or self improvement though?  For instance, if a bodybuilder wants to achieve their ideal physique or body, they need to maintain a strict diet and exercise regimen even if there may be times when they would like relax or eat junk food.\n3. How does one determine that they aren't acting towards some phantasm? Is it just a matter of following your intuition or gut? How do you know that you aren't acting toward some deeply embedded or unconscious phantasm?\n4. How would anarcho-egoism deal with future potential problems, e.g. climate change? Is climate change not a phantasm that we would have to change our behaviour in order to avoid the worse effects of it? This seems antithetical to egoism.\n5. What further books/works would you recommend I read to get a better idea of anarcho-egoism?\n\nThank you for your help!",

It is very probable that a single commune would not have the resources for, for example, creating and repairing every street and maintaining public services. So, how would they bring and do all those things?

  "selftext": "i want to start this question by noting i immensely respect the anarchist committment to liberation and equal rights of all people. but there is one anarchist talking point that I have encountered many times, and have always been completely unable to internalize. it feels very alien to me and i'm not sure i understand the anarchist position in its entirety here. this point is as follows: anarchists seem to be unable to recognize that some problems of some people are not really *caused* by society, and society would have to constantly take active steps to mitigate them, which seems different from most forms of liberation that merely require a cessation of marginalizing activity, yet this is rarely if ever recognized.\n\ni'll use myself, and groups i belong to, as an example, for fear of offending anyone or misrepresenting some other group's struggles. i am a neurodivergent (in a bad way) transgender person. i face a lot of problems in society the way it currently exists. some of these problems - such as institutions trying to take active action to prevent me from accessing care i need, or threats of violence - obviously and transparently stem from existing systems of oppression, and their mitigation requires the dismantlement of these systems and nothing else. but this seems transparently false for some other problems i face.\n\nfor example, i have problems navigating some social spaces the way normal people do, and certain inputs of information have an unpleasant effect on me. these problems are immutable - they have to do with the way i am. in a way, i will just never be able to do some things as well or as effortlessly as neurotypical people do them. in cases like this, however, anarchists seem to treat a failure to provide *active accomodations to me* as a form of oppression equivalent of being explicitly excluded for my immutable traits. even in cases when providing such accomodations makes no economic sense simply because there are not enough people needing them for how much they might cost, anarchists, including market anarchists, treat this as a problem of societal intolerance and intersectional bigotry, the same way they treat 'active oppression' that requires effort on part of the oppressor.\n\nto me, the difference between the two is obvious, and i do not see how an equivalence can ever be drawn up against them. one very clearly cannot exist in a truly free society, but the other, if taken to logical conclusion, is impossible to eliminate without organized coercive structures overseeing said efforts, at least within a market anarchist incentive structure. is there something i am missing? has this question already been answered? is this a fundamental flaw of market anarchism versus other forms of anarchism?",

  "title": "Some technical questions about the implementation of a mutual aid based economy on a large scale",
  "selftext": "Hi!\n\nSo I having been thinking about how the implementation of a mutual aid based economy would work on scale.\n\nA lot of communist thought tends to center on more local knowledge. So, like, the classic argument against anarcho-communism is \"Well why would anyone work?\" and the answer is that like, if you don't contribute to the commons you aren't gonna get the nicest stuff. That stuff goes to the people who actually do contribute. Sure your medical needs and all that will be met, but if you're just lazy or whatever people aren't obligated to give you the best goods or luxuries or whatever.\n\nAnd that's fine and all, but that kinda breaks down as you scale up, simply because you can't know everyone in a larger economy, and thus don't have a way of knowing how/if they contribute to the commons. So it becomes a lot easier to slip through the cracks.\n\nThe answer, to me, seems to be to create a system to measure contribution and consumption, a la [mutual credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_credit) (a mutualist idea). Everyone is able to consume as much as they want, up until an agreed upon limit (with flexibility based on the individual or emergency circumstances). Consumption is viewed as debt, i.e. taking out of the system, and production as credit, i.e. adding to the system. So when you do labor for someone they give you x tokens and they lose x tokens. You can go negative if you want, just never over the agreed upon limit.\n\nThe best way to think about these tokens is that they're pledges to do labor in the future. So if I give you 10 tokens, I am pledging to do 10 tokens worth of labor for someone (not necessarily you) in the mutual aid/credit network in the future. It's basically just measured and formalized mutual aid. In all honesty, this system is basically just mutual aid but with record keeping. So I record that I did 10 tokens worth of labor for Jeff, and he records that he consumed 10 tokens worth of labor for me. Later Jeff does 10 tokens worth of labor for Mary, balancing out the whole thing so Production - Consumption = 0 across the whole network. No profit or interest or any of that capitalist nonsense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, with that said, here are the technical questions:\n\nHow do you ensure that the record keeping is accurate? The way I see it you have two options: a centralized or decentralized approach. You can store records in a centralized location. That leaves a lot of power in the hands of that location and forms a single point of failure for the network (a fire or malicious actor could destroy or modify records). A more secure solution seems to be a distribute peer-to-peer style system of record keeping (as in the more localized communist system, except their record keeping is more informal and personal, based on memories and whatnot). The question then becomes: How do you ensure these peer-to-peer record keeping systems are accurate? Let's say Jeff consumes 10 tokens worth of labor from me but later decides he doesn't want to do labor to redeem that consumption, so he modifies his record to delete that consumption. If he did this, then across the whole network Production < Consumption and that means you're gonna have problems as there's too many hands grasping for too little. Similarly, I could modify my own records and pretend I did more work than I actually did, which allows for me to consume more than I produce. And that can unbalance the network as well.\n\nSo what we need is a way of ensuring that these records are genuine and that both parties agreed to it and cannot modify the record afterwards.\n\nI know that blockchain and crypto exists, but a) that's pretty environmentally damaging and b) the whole thing reeks of a scam to me given... you know....\n\nSo, is there a good peer-to-peer record keeping authentication system?\n\nOr do we have to rely on more centralized approaches (which are also liable to potential issues regarding security of records)?\n\nIn essence both of these forms of tampering with records amount to stealing from the commons, and we do need systems to prevent that. Even if you reject the mutual credit idea, we do still need some way of measuring who is consuming and who is producing in a large scale mutual aid based economy because if you don't it's hard to prevent free-rider issues and the like and ensure everyone contributes.",

Like say for instance, you have a [bidet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidet) manufacturing collective that wants to sell more bidets because they think they're superior to toilet paper (and they can make a profit off it), how would they let consumers know about their product? Would it all be by word-of-mouth (which is how, I understand, the Communist and Collectivist Anarchists want it), or might there be alternative channels of advertising, maybe ones set up by the Confederation, and requiring them to be informative and unintrusive or something?

Education is important but incredibly difficult.\n* How to communicate with others. Organization requires socialization which is another difficult skill.\n* Taking action. Sometimes just putting plans into place is difficult, often due to physical/mental health problems, and healthcare sucks in my country. Mutual aid healthcare would be awesome but I do not have the skills for that.\n\n\n\nAnd then there's lack of resources regarding:\n\n* Money. Obviously, no money means no resources for mutual aid.\n* Time/Labor. Capitalism loves grabbing as much of our labor as possible, leaving none for ourselves.\n* Capital. If we actually owned our means of production, money wouldn't be an issue. Alas, capitalism and the state have stolen almost everything.\n\nThese seem to be the main things to me that prevent further anarchist movement, although I'm certain there's other factors/perspectives I'm missing.

So, I was wondering if anybody had any empirical evidence or literature that covers past or present cases of this kind of “workers concession” occurring. \n\nIt seems like Social Democracies generally aren’t that bad as an interim institution (as in if we happened to elect someone right now in the U.S that was a social democrat it would be pretty good for those who are barely subsisting from their low wages) but do not serve as an ends to a means, or a relative end goal. I see it as being desirable within a capitalist system for those struggling, but not necessarily being an actual means to an ends in it of itself. \n\nMaybe a better way to put it would be that I see Social Democracy as a helpful tool for those who are struggling and are living day to day.

  "selftext": "Hi! I am a Marxist, but I would like to know more about the differences between anarchism and Marxism and about their similarities.\n\nSo that we can speak more concretely, I attach here my political convictions: In an ideal case, after the revolution, the state must be preserved for a certain period, as an instrument for the exercise of political violence against the exploiting classes.  This state should be run through the soviets.  There would be soviets of different levels: local, regional, etc.  Anyone should be able to represent his interests even in higher level soviets, even when he does not have a majority in the local soviet (as it was in the Soviet Union).  All the decisions that can be solved at a lower level, must be solved there (decisions are made only by the people that are influenced by that decision).  The supreme bodies in the state are the Soviets.  They create those \"executive committees\" (\"governments\") that implement the decisions of the soviets (in the way that all soviets decide).  Regarding that \"avant-garde party\", I am of the Marxist opinion that it has special importance.  However, I believe that, in a Soviet republic, he should not participate directly in the management of the state, but should continue to work with the people from below, just as he did until the revolution.  They must focus on the development of theory, the propagation of ideas in society, the organization of the masses, etc.  Already through those masses, who participate in the soviets, the party ends up \"leading\" the state.  People can always choose other leaders if they want.  In this context, the party truly remains part of the masses and does not separate itself from them forming that \"political elite\".\n\nSome anarchists, as far as I know, understand the need to keep a \"small state\", reduced to the minimum and for as short a period as possible.  Likewise, regarding the idea of a \"vanguard party\", I suppose most anarchists reject this concept more in the sense of \"a few people directly running the country\" and not in the above sense.  In this context, I would like to know if I am right and if the differences between Marxism (a rather libertarian variant of Marxism) and anarchism are really that big, in your opinion?\n\nBesides this question, I would also be interested in other differences between them.  Likewise, I am open to other ideas, recommendations of books/articles/etc on the topic.\n\n(I apologize for my poor English. I hope it's not such a big problem to understand what I wrote).",

Give unions necessary resources to strike longer. Teach prospective soldiers a trade via skillshare so they don't need the army for college (“when the soldiers will refuse to obey their superiors, the whole system of capitalism will be doomed” -Emma Goldman). But we need to be honest that unions and trade jobs are not the end goal; we’re working to destroy capitalism.\nExpand the mutual aid network as far as possible (nationally, or continental) & run it as a directly democratic confederation (this lets us understand what each in the sense that what we are for and against is clearly defined). When enough people join & it's stable, refuse to buy/work so the economy freezes, and make it completely clear why you’re on strike.\nBefore the gov attacks the network & unions (like it's historically done) we need to learn how to defend our communities. That way we can take the water/power plants and factories and incorporate them into the network. This is framework for a revolution I’ve thought about for a while. It lays the foundation for a better society, shifts us away from our ‘culture’ of nationalist tribalism (that’s somehow still individualistic), and it has given me hope in the last several months since I put it together.\n\nTl;dr Build a mutual aid network sufficient for your community (which will expand) to go on strike.

  "title": "Seeking some clarification on mutualist value theory. Specifically regarding \"pleasurable labor\" and dis-utility",
  "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI recently discovered this channel: [https://www.youtube.com/@Plutophrenia](https://www.youtube.com/@Plutophrenia)\n\nIt's been super helpful and I have learned a lot from it.\n\nOne of the videos on this channel is this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Xw9OIpB94](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0Xw9OIpB94) and it's all about mutualist value theory (specifically the combination of the subjective theory of value of the marginalists and classical labor theory of value).\n\nThe way this channel describes it, utility is the impelling force for labor, and disutility is the limiting force. Where they meet will be the quantity produced by an individual.\n\nThe basic assumption behind this logic is that labor has an associated dis-utility. It represents an ABSOLUTE cost. Unlike capital or land usage, whose only real cost is opportunity cost and that's only because whoever controls the assets CAN charge for access, labor is an absolute cost because the laborer is not choosing between two types of labor, but whether to labor or not labor.\n\nNow that makes a lot of sense to me for the vast majority of labor in an economy.\n\nHe also goes on to say that \"pleasurable labor\" still follows this logic, but the basic idea is that the end product is something that the laborer takes pride in or admires, or alternatively from the expected reward of labor of having overcome the toil involved. So the \"pleasure\" comes from the finished product, not the labor in and of itself. All of this makes a lot of intuitive sense to me and I really like that idea. In order to convince someone to do something unpleasant, you must give them something of equal or greater value to that unpleasantness.\n\nWhat I wanted to really understand is: what about in cases where the labor, in and of itself, is inherently pleasant? \n\nI enjoy listening to several comedy podcasts, and I also love watching some D&D series on youtube. Cracking jokes with your friends is something that people do for fun, as is playing D&D (because it's a game, it is inherently enjoyable to play right? That's the point of a game).\n\nSo where is the dis-utility of labor in this process? Games and jokes are something people actively seek out because they provide utility. Sure, there's an argument to be made that editing the podcast or video and uploading it has associated dis-utility, but if that's the case, then shouldn't the hosts of the podcast or the players in the D&D campaign not need to be paid because they don't have an associated dis-utility?\n\nThe best reply I thought of is that their time has an associated opportunity cost. So they have decided to labor for say, 8 hours a day, and because this recording session takes up some of those 8 hours of that day, they need compensation equal to the compensation they would have gotten from doing unpleasant labor during that time (maybe not even that much, cause the utility from podcast/filming would also be factored in).\n\nBut now that factors in opportunity cost as well. And sure, that opportunity cost is going to be defined by the utility/dis-utility of what you could be doing with those same hours and so it's still based in dis-utility of labor, but is there more nuance to this than I initially thought?\n\nThe only other reply I could think of is that, while playing D&D with friends is fun, it usually isn't recorded and shared with a large audience. That might be a source of dis-utility? But why would that be? Especially if the folks involved are comfortable with that sort of thing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, thank you! I would love to figure out where the source of dis-utility is in these sorts of \"fun\" labor that people do (like recording games, or cracking jokes with a friend, that sorta thing. What people do normally that is inherently joyful as opposed to admiring a finished work or something along those lines)?\n\nEdit:\n\nI suppose the disutility could arise from the process of being filmed, as most don't normally do that part for fun. So you have to incentive people to film for you as opposed to simply sitting at home on the couch or playing with friends and that's where the compensation comes in.\n\nWith that being I said, I don't totally see where the disutility arises from the process of being filmed. Some people are comfortable on camera right?\n\nBut I guess there is some disutility cause if there wasn't people would normally film their games and upload to YouTube Irrespective of pay. And most people don't do that.\n\nI just have trouble identifying the source of that disutility.",

  "title": "Is it more feasible to ensure high quality for as many as possible or lower quality for accessibility to the masses?",
  "selftext": "Hey, I'm writing a narrative featuring my favorite political dilemma; should the goal be to ensure the highest quality or the greatest accessiblity?\n\nI apply this to everything, all the time. I believe that when the goal is widest access, a dip in quality has to be expected. And most people's demands for higher quality don't come with an acknowledgement of limited resources. They just *wish* for higher quality and *hope* that educated, well-trained, properly funded help just solves the problem for them. \n\nSo when I say \"lower quality\" I don't mean bad. I just mean, not luxury, not middle class, fully paid service. So often, I advocate for solutions that works towards the greatest accessiblity possible, and it is an answer that incorporates the most \"do-it-yourselfism\", minimalism, education, and automation. And people who disagree with me usually have an air of \"that's not dignified/good enough\" to their rebuttals and a demand for \"higher quality\". Some examples,\n\nHomelessness and Homeownership: I believe the most \"amount\" of house to give someone with limited income is just enough house that they can clean, fix, and maintain *by themselves*. (With attention paid to educating them on that, too.) So many problems I've seen in addressing homes has come from well-meaning people calculating the cost of the home, but not the cost of the concierge of services required to maintain the home, as they encourage people to buy houses that require an instant elevation to middle class thinking and lifestyle to maintain. Because from their perspective, smaller, more rugged housing is undignified. \n\nFood: I think everyone should cook. But I also think most people only need to know 3-5 dishes, only need a pot, a skillet and one good chef knife, and about a dozen ingredients they buy regularly. When people shake their fists to the heavens and say that it's impossible to eat healthy when melons and oranges cost so much, I point out that red bell peppers and broccoli have more Vitamin C at a lower cost. People can eat plenty of fruits without picking up exotic tropical ones: tomato, zucchini, and cucumber. There. \n\nEducation: If all you ever have is a middle school education, you were still taught to read and how to write a 5-paragraph research essay using critical thinking questions and a bibliography. The simplicity and pervasiveness of literacy, and yet our unwillingness to educate ourselves for the next 60 years of our lives, shows me how much we use the excuse of demanding higher quality to avoid providing and using the greatest access. \"But did a college educated teacher get paid a salary to make me learn this?! Then how can I possibly learn it. By just reading this book?!\" \n\nSo at this point, I'm willing to acknowledge the pragmatism that human behavior wants to feel good by having \"the best.\" Plenty of times people ignore simple solutions because they don't feel good. \n\nBut I can't think of that many examples in real life where the demand for the best actually led to the most ethical outcome that helped the most people. I have even walked away from a steering committee that was designing a grocery store to put in an African-American neighborhood because other people on the steering committee demanded \"the best\". They didn't want whole foods that African Americans were more likely to eat, they wanted whole foods you would find at Whole Foods. And they acknowledged that people would likely not buy these foods, but their presence would elevate the grocery store and give people a better self-esteem, and that that was just as important of a goal as the grocery store being profitable and selling its inventory. \n\nI've also walked away from programs for what seems like the opposite reason. When addressing why some senior citizens quietly starve in their homes, I've pointed out to my program manager that it's simply an issue of getting prepared food delivered to them. (This was before the pandemic, back when \"deliverying groceries by Internet\" was still a joke.) I wanted to make a service and my program manager felt that was too expensive and acted as if it would help the most people to expect these elderly people to come to their location. Duh, if they can't get to the grocery store, why could they get to our office building? We need to provide a service. \n\nSo, I CAN make an argument that high-quality service can sometimes help more than lower quality rugged individualism... But the examples are few and far between. It makes more sense to pay stipends and provide training for people to care for their own families than assume and wish and hope you can get enough people to make careers out of taking care of all of our grandmothers. It makes more sense to pay for gardening seeds with food stamp cards then think that you can get high quality grocery stores in every square inch of America. But \"food desert\" research is based ONLY on measuring how many high-quality grocery stores are in a zip code. 8/10 times, I don't think demanding that the standard be high-quality is the right decision.",

  "selftext": "Hi ! I'm an undergrad in political science doing a paper on prison abolition vs. prison reform, and I'm wondering if you had good examples of anarchists engaging with the former.\n\nTo be fair, it's very easy to find good resources on \"open prisons\" (ie. prison reform), and it's even easier to find extremely sound criticisms of carceral systems. However, I must admit that I don't know a lot of books that really delve deep into what a prison-less society might concretely offer, which is why I'm turning to anarchism.\n\nHow would an anarchist society treat a pedophile, for example ? What about counter-revolutionaries ? Was it justified for revolutionary Spain to jail fascists, for Rojava to jail ISIS members, etc. ?\n\nMore broadly, Foucault said that anyone who sought to abolish the prison had first the task to imagine a society where power structures could function without a need for illegalism (ie. the artificial creation and othering of \"delinquent\" lumpens through the vicious cycles of the carceral industrial complex), historically, how did anarchist theorists and projects engage with that task ?\n\nI was watching a video on anarchism ( «After the revolution », by Anark), that adressed the subject of prison abolition with the concept of « Rehabilitation communities », ie. when a prejudice is committed, if, and only if, reconciliation processes between the victim and guilty parties lead to nowhere, the community could send the later to a   « rehabilitation community », that would fonction like any other anarchist entity (direct democracy, self-rule, etc.)). However, if feel a bit dumb because I fail to grasp how what I just described is not essentially just an extremely reformed (and much more humane, obviously) system of sanction by incarceration (a prison, in other terms). Foucault was extremely critical of scandinavian-style open prisons, stating that they were nicer, sure, but by no means progressive or revolutionary, since they upheld the very logic, moralism and work-ethic of carceral ideology (in 1976, « Alternatives à la Prison », he states that reforming a prison is like scolding a child by asking him if he prefers to be smacked or to have his desert taking away). In other words : however merciful a punishment might be, it still presupposes a power dynamic, right ? Am I misunderstanding this ? If not, how did prior anarchists come to terms with paradox ? \n\nThanks to yall in advance ! ",

The international political system and political economy is an unregulated battleground where self-interested states take shots trying to gain more power. This has allowed for hegemons and empires to rise, utilizing the chaotic anarchic system to their advantage, where strength and might is literally all that’s needed for global domination. \n\nWhy then, does an anarchist advocate for an anarchic society when we can take many lessons of its failures by looking at the history of our world politics from a macro scale?

My intention with this is in good faith and hopefully to generate debate. \n\n* Questions are essentially a guide.\n* I am not a native English speaker, so I will gladly make an effort to understand you.\n\n\nPart 1  \n\n1. Is ideological purity an obstacle to achieving tangible advances in improving the conditions of the oppressed, and should we consider pragmatic strategies within state institutions?\n\n2. Do we trust enough in the self-organizational capacity of the masses, or are we underestimating their potential by dismissing institutional political strategies?  \n\n3. Does automatically rejecting interaction with the State reflect a dogmatic stance, and would it be more beneficial to adopt strategic approaches on a case-by-case basis?\n\n4. Can we learn from historical revolutionaries who, with pragmatism, took advantage of contradictions in power without compromising their long-term ideals?  \n\n5. Is there a risk of self-isolating by adopting a hostile attitude towards movements that use participatory strategies, thus losing the capacity to exert real and effective influence?\n\n\nPart 2  \n\n1. Does participating in hierarchical institutions contradict anarchist principles, or is it a valid tactic for advancing towards emancipatory objectives?  \n\n2. Is there a danger of legitimizing and strengthening oppressive structures by participating in elections or state institutions, and how to mitigate that risk?\n\n3. Do we risk being co-opted by the system by entering the political game, compromising our principles for the sake of adaptation and moderation?  \n\n4. Should we focus on building anarchist alternatives outside the political system, such as collectives and mutual support networks, rather than trying to change it from within?  \n\n5. How to prevent participation in elections or public office from becoming an end in itself, diverting us from fundamental anarchist objectives?\n\n6. In case we decide to participate, how to ensure we don’t indefinitely postpone the pursuit of fundamental anarchist objectives, such as the abolition of the State and capitalism?",

I understand that perhaps some of Proudhon's proposals were transitory or before he developed a consistent anarchist theory of social change/revolution, but I'm having trouble understanding what Proudhon means when he talks about \"Centralizing\" in section 3: Forms of Government. \n\nIn my interpretation, this seems to be a description/program/prediction of what is needed in a transitionary period towards anarchy? He describes a tendency towards centralizing certain industries organically and without the state, saying something along the lines of the industries now being hierarchical and centralized, while in anarchy or on the way towards anarchy they will be centralized yet be egalitarian.\n\nSo which is it? Is this a program or prediction of what will happen? And is this centralization egalitarian or not?

I must be missing something because I don't quite understand what left communism is.\n\nI think an important question to ask to answer this question if I understand correctly is do you think you can be a Marxist and an anarchist? My opinion is of course yes because Marxian critiques of capitalism, the state, and his overall analytical framework can be used to explain the need for anarchocommunism as that was his endgoal after all. You don't have to worship Marx or be a classical or orthodox Marxist to be a Marxist as that really only really entails being an actual socialist who analyzes the material conditions from an ostensibly dielectical materialist framework.

  "selftext": "I've found it somewhat useful, but I haven't seen others use it. Does anyone even know about it or is it that obscure?\n\nI've only seen it used in the Anarchist FAQ, and specifically in section B.1. Forgive me for the massive wall of text.\n> This distinction between forms of authority is important. As Erich Fromm pointed out, “authority” is “a broad term with two entirely different meanings: it can be either ‘rational’ or ‘irrational’ authority. Rational authority is based on competence, and it helps the person who leans on it to grow. Irrational authority is based on power and serves to exploit the person subjected to it.” [To Have or To Be, pp. 44–45] The same point was made by Bakunin over 100 years earlier when he indicated the difference between authority and “natural influence.” For Bakunin, individual freedom “results from th[e] great number of material, intellectual, and moral influences which every individual around him [or her] and which society … continually exercise … To abolish this mutual influence would be to die.” Consequently, “when we reclaim the freedom of the masses, we hardly wish to abolish the effect of any individual’s or any group of individual’s natural influence upon the masses. What we wish is to abolish artificial, privileged, legal, and official influences.” [The Basic Bakunin, p. 140 and p. 141]\n\n>It is, in other words, the difference between taking part in a decision and listening to alternative viewpoints and experts (“natural influence”) before making your mind up and having a decision made for you by a separate group of individuals (who may or may not be elected) because that is their role in an organisation or society. In the former, the individual exercises their judgement and freedom (i.e. is based on rational authority). In the latter, they are subjected to the wills of others, to hierarchical authority (i.e. is based on irrational authority). This is because rational authority “not only permits but requires constant scrutiny and criticism … it is always temporary, its acceptance depending on its performance.” The source of irrational authority, on the other hand, “is always power over people … Power on the one side, fear on the other, are always the buttresses on which irrational authority is built.” Thus former is based upon “equality” while the latter “is by its very nature based upon inequality.” [Erich Fromm, Man for Himself, pp. 9–10]\n\n>This crucial point is expressed in the difference between having authority and being an authority. Being an authority just means that a given person is generally recognised as competent for a given task, based on his or her individual skills and knowledge. Put differently, it is socially acknowledged expertise. In contrast, having authority is a social relationship based on status and power derived from a hierarchical position, not on individual ability. Obviously this does not mean that competence is not an element for obtaining a hierarchical position; it just means that the real or alleged initial competence is transferred to the title or position of the authority and so becomes independent of individuals, i.e. institutionalised (or what Bakunin termed “official”).\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-full#text-amuse-label-secb1",

And this power, in our opinion, constitutes the principle of government, of authority.” (Malatesta, 6) \n\nHe equates the principle of government and the principle of authority, so while talking about governors, his statements here apply just as well to authority-holders. The governors have the power to use \"the social power\" and can oblige others to carry out their wishes. This necessitates a hierarchy and the usage of force. \n\nFrom this, the definition of authority that I have made is, \"A role within a hierarchy that gives the power or right to give orders and make decisions for others while enforcing obedience by coercion or threat of coercion.

Its been said repeatedly that people living in anarchist societies will have a different view of community and giving than people who grew up under hierarchal oppression. This pretty much assumes that your population consists in significant majority of either people who grew up in anarchist communities, or who did the reading and came into this with the specific intention of being anarchist-- this will not work if you just take a bunch of people who grew up in oppression and dump them into an area with no government.\n\nSo, with refugees,\n\n* There are currently a lot of people in very desperate situations who would like to move to basically anywhere other than where they currently are. They will move, not a few at a time, but in mass, to any safe area that will accept them. This will not stop if we end capitalism tomorrow-- climate change alone will keep this going for the rest of our lives\n*  They will come, not because they want to be anarchist, but because they want to be safe (a laudable goal!)\n* the vast majority of these people are not anarchist and in fact many are from very conservative/hierarchal cultures and/or religions (islam most obviously, but not exclusive to that).\n* Its easy to say people will adopt anarchist ideas if its a few at a time, but it doesn't happen instantly, and even less likely if the newcomers make up >20% of the population and share a language/religion\n\n- One answer I've seen here is that anarchism should be built gradually, starting with community projects, mutual aid, unions, co-ops etc. That's a good idea, but I presume that at some point, there will be a plan for anarchist areas to exist outside of government control. And of course, one assumes these areas will have open borders, also laudable, so they will welcome all refugees\n\n-----\n\n*My motivation for posting this is not a gotcha but a sincere interest in hearing ideas for how to handle it. I lived in germany for most of the 2010s and say first-hand the strife caused by mass movement of immigrants-- I and everyone in my family were very in support of helping immigrants and still are. We volunteered moving people and helping get food and resources to new immigrants. I do in fact still favor open borders-- but i think its *difficult* in ways that I think people who haven't experienced it underestimate. \n\nLeaving aside xenophobia, assuming everyone sincerely wants to help, settling large amounts of people is tricky. Many/most of them didn't know how to work our systems (bus routes, atms are different apparently, getting a cell phone plan, how to make a doctor appointment-- theres so much stuff)*, not speaking the same language, very often sick and traumatized upon arrival, etc. I do believe this would be *easier* without so much government red tape-- i don't think it would be *easy.* And if you're talking about fully open borders that's probably 10x more people per capita than we were taking in, in a probably newer, less stable community than the entire country of germany.",

  "selftext": "\"[What is Authority](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/mikhail-bakunin-what-is-authority)\" is the essay Bakunin wrote that appears within *God and the State,* ultimately meant to be part of *The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution*.\n\nContextually, it comes right after Bakunin made an extended argument against idealists and theologians who wanted to argue that the idea of God was compatible with human liberty.\n\nRight before he begins then, he says this:\n\n>Perhaps, too, while speaking of liberty as something very respectable and very dear, they [the idealists and theologians] understood the term quite differently than we do, as materialists and revolutionary socialists. Indeed, they never speak of it without immediately adding another word, authority—a word and a thing which we detest with all our heart.\n\nRight after this, Bakunin considers one definition of authority then, but leaves it as an open question.\n\n>Bakunin: What is authority? Is it the inevitable power of the natural laws which manifest themselves in the necessary concatenation and succession of phenomena in the physical and social worlds? Indeed, against these laws revolt is not only forbidden, but is even impossible. We may misunderstand them or still not know them at all, but we cannot disobey them, because they constitute the basis and very conditions of our existence; they envelop us, penetrate us, regulate all our movements, thoughts, and acts, so that even when we believe that we disobey them, we do nothing but demonstrate their omnipotence.\n\n>Yes, we are absolutely the slaves of these laws. But there is nothing humiliating in that slavery, or, rather, it is not slavery at all. For slavery supposes an external master, a legislator outside of the one whom he commands, while these laws are not outside of us; they are inherent in us; they constitute our being, our whole being, as much physically as intellectually and morally. We live, we breathe, we act, we think, we wish only through these laws. Without them we are nothing–we are not. From where, then, could we derive the power and the wish to rebel against them?\n\nWe have a potential definition of authority here then: \"the inevitable power of natural laws.\"\n\nBut here is my question: Is this meant to be the *idealist* definition Bakunin is critiquing? Or the *materialist* definition he is proposing?\n\nI have read it in the former way. The idealist is proposing this sense of authority because they can \"never speak of liberty without immediately adding another word, authority\". With this definition, we could see why. For human liberty to exist, humans must exist, and therefore conform with the laws of existence. This definition also makes it clear that abolishing authority would be impossible. To abolish authority would require abolishing existence.\n\nBakunin seems to later critique this definition too. He says we are \"absolutely the slaves of these laws.\" But then he turns around and says it is \"not slavery at all.\" His reason for this is that slavery \"supposes an external master,\" which contrasts to the inevitable laws of science and mathematics which \"constitute our being.\"\n\nThe way I read this then, Bakunin is contrasting two senses of the word authority. The idealist uses it to mean necessity. Because of this, they understand the word \"quite differently than we do, as materialists and revolutionary socialists.\" For Bakunin, slavery, and authority by extension, requires this kind of external master, making it quantitatively different from the laws of physics.\n\nThis reading seemed obvious enough to me. However, I have seen that /u/humanispherian, whose work I deeply appreciate and even translated the copy of the text I cited above, offers another interpretation, found [here](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/bakunin-library/the-authority-of-the-bootmaker-2/) and [here](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/bakunin-on-authority-proudhon-on-property/).\n\nAccording to him, when Bakunin proposes the \"inevitable power of natural laws\" as a meaning of authority, he is proposing this as a *materialist* definition.\n\n>Humanispherian: Rather than talking about what the idealists consider to be authority, he [Bakunin] asks a question, in which we see a possible materialist definition.\n\nI would argue that Bakunin *is* telling us what the idealists consider to be authority, which he contrasts to the materialist sense in the very next paragraph.\n\nHumanispherian gives what I still consider a fairly plausible reading of Bakunin here though. Faced with an authority that is impossible to abolish, the role of the anarchist is now to promote rebellion and push it as far as possible. We push constantly to overcome these limits, reducing them as far as possible.\n\nWhen Bakunin does accept some authority, such as the \"authority of the bootmaker,\" it is read as a reluctant acceptance here.\n\n>Humanispherian: [Bakunin] bows to the inevitable, which we know is the only law he will recognize. And if our reading of the nuances is not entirely incorrect, we have no reason, I think, to imagine that he bows, even to necessity, with particularly good grace. At the limits of his knowledge, life, reason and rebellion should, we expect, all be brought to bear. In the absence of “fixed and constant authority,” developing humanity might at least aspire to less of both authority and subordination.\n\nI think this reading is probably on the right track... However, the text itself doesn't show Bakunin as all that reluctant to accept the \"authority\" of science and math. On the contrary, he mocks the idealists for trying to rebel against it themselves.\n\n>Bakunin: One must, for instance, be at base either a fool or a theologian or at least a metaphysician, jurist, or bourgeois economist to rebel against the law by which 2 x 2 makes 4. One must have faith to imagine that fire will not burn nor water drown, unless one has recourse to some subterfuge that is still based on some other natural law. But these rebellions, or, rather, these attempts at or foolish fancies of an impossible revolt, only form a rare exception; for, in general, it may be said that the mass of men, in their daily lives, let themselves be governed by good sense—that is, by the sum of the natural laws generally recognized—in an almost absolute fashion.\n\nI think Bakunin's attitude toward the bootmaker is better read if we recognize that he is distinguishing these two meanings of the word authority, namely distinguishing whether this \"authority\" is of an internal nature (the idealist sense of authority) or an external nature (the materialist sense).\n\n>Bakunin: If I bow before the authority of the specialists and declare myself ready to follow, to a certain extent and as long as may seem to me necessary, their indications and even their directions, it is because that authority is imposed upon me by no one, neither by men nor by God. Otherwise I would drive them back in horror, and let the devil take their counsels, their direction, and their science, certain that they would make me pay, by the loss of my liberty and human dignity, for the scraps of truth, wrapped in a multitude of lies, that they might give me.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I on the right track?",

Obviously many people have been fed up with the uselessness of police forces and some have taken up action as costumed characters straight from a comic book that I would and still love to read.

My question is a little different from ***most*** of the \"how does anarchism deal with murder.\" \n\nLast night my partner asked me about prison abolition, rehabilitation, and all that jazz. I explained it to her, along with my strong feelings about it and why I felt that way. Then she asked, \"what about mass murderers?\" I responded by saying exile or death, which I understand sounds a bit like [that batman line](https://youtu.be/QswquD2sDUw?si=DS_231wu7DsXa5ja).\n\nI firmly believe that most people deserve second chances, however I also think there are some things you can't come back from. After you cross a certain point you cannot ever be accepted into society again. For instance, when I was in the ME I spoke to a man whose community had been terrorized by ISIS, they'd take people to the tops of the towers at a nearby plant and push them off while their families were forced to watch. The fall didn't always kill them and anyone who tried to help the victim would be shot or pushed off themselves.\n\nIn my mind, the people who perpetrated this don't deserve a second chance and, although I think exile is an alternative, I worry that exile would risk them coming back or terrorizing someone else. Maybe I'm wrong here, in fact I'm sure there are many people who think I am, but I see no other way.\n\nMurderers, rapists, even pedophiles. Rehabilitate them. Mass murderers, serial rapists, terrorists (this last depending on the situation).

Do we want them free too? Many prisons also have fascists",

  "selftext": "This question assumes the anarchist region is next to at least 1 capitalist region, and is no bigger than a city.\n\nI think mass death is kinda inevitable. Not in the eco-fash way, but rather that capitalism has created large groups of vulnerable people that will have no support in dealing with its ramifications (climate change, eventual scarcity of essentials, etc). They will experience natural disasters, civil war, authoritarian regimes, and other vehicles of mass death that overwhelmingly affect the poor.\n\nI dont want this. I want to be convinced that it can be avoided under anarchism (at least enough for population decline to be shouldered by lower birth rates).\n\nIssues:\n\n1. Several essential supply chains will rely on external regions. Despite the immense waste of capitalist production, I think most, if not all densely populated places on earth lack the capacity to be self-sufficient. Cities are also incapable of large-scale agriculture, which probably limits their bargaining power with capitalist regions as that’s a very immediate need. How do you participate in these supply chains without conceding to capitalist demands?\n\n2. unless you maintain the same or better quality of life for workers with valuable skills, they are materially incentivized to go somewhere else. Many might stay on principle, or because of loyalty to the people there, but many would leave if their QoL declines. \n\n- The benefits many well-paid workers get right now are built off exploitation of consumers/taxpayers/other workers (e.g. well-paid surgeons benefit from price-gouging health insurance). A society with more equal resource distribution would likely result in their QoL declining.\n- Essential programs may require disruption of the status quo that aren’t appreciated. E.g. housing the homeless without expanding the region may require people sharing their homes or lower-density suburbs being replaced by apartments, and either would have opposition.\n- what happens to the internet (and tv)? It’s the most effective tool of capitalist/fascist propaganda and very costly to maintain, but it’s also essential for long-distance communication, and has funny videos of cats :3. Seriously, no internet or restricted internet would be a dealbreaker for a lot of folks, even if they sympathized with anarchists.",

I think that the government should not exist but that everyone can individualistically decide things as a direct democratic group without representation of any kind or a hierarchy of any kind. everyone should be born equal with equal opportunities and equal wealth. I don't think people should be allowed to own more than a million, nobody needs that much. nor should excess wealth be allowed to be inherited. companies shouldn't have rights of any kind especially not human rights. companies like disney and mcdonalds should be considered world powers. people should not be able to own land they aren't using to live on, corporations shouldn't own land and they should operate on a pirates share type of employee pay plan where everyone gets an equal share proportional to their work and the profits they gained for the company. I don't believe labor or service work has any inherent value separate from the desire to not do said work and instead society should be structured to allow people to do things they like or want to do because they want to do it instead of needing to do it due to a threat of death, be it direct or indirect. I believe only material wealth should have worth and that people should only have to do things they want to do and that all the things we don't want to do should be automated. I do not believe jobs are important and I believe them to only exist due to the greedy few desiring more than they need as well as the unfortunate reality that the logistics required to make use of our fruits tend to be interfered with by others to the gains of each own. I think that everyone should be able to grow their own food on their own land and control said land completely, except for cases wherein which adverse effects would occur to nearby or adjacency properties or wildlife. we should all be able to buy a dirt plot and throughout our lives guide it to prosperity without government interference preventing us from building our dream castle. I also disagree with the concept of owning an idea. ideas can't actually be owned. people think they can own ideas by throwing copycats in jail but that's just bullying. if you have a good idea and it would better another's life in any way you should not be allowed to monopolies that idea. following this line of thought I also don't believe in copyrights or trademarks and instead people should rely on facts and logic to determine quality with bad owners of IP's being able to lose ownership simply by having a competitor figure out how to use the IP better.

They are equal in ownership of everything, ability to set goals and plan to meet them, and their ability to harm others. this creates a state where one does not have true freedom, because others have the ability to act on you to take your freedom and sets forward the idea that true freedom can only be gained when one gives up their ability to harm others and ownership over all things.\n\nWhat this tells us is that logically, all humans should form a commonwealth, a unity of sorts in whatever form that takes that limits their freedoms by mediating their disputes and redressing their injuries but by doing so creates the situation where all other freedoms are maintained and all people are equal creating a situation where the degree of freedom is actually higher than in the state of nature.\n\nMy explanation isn't super awesome, i encourage you search up the direct stuff from Locke and Rosseau\n\nThis should then explain why some system is required for society to be truly free, it also sparked the modern idea of libertarianism. i tend to use it to explain the whys of feudalism and monarchy, the failures of modern capitalism, and how some hierarchies may have come to pass such as feudalism.\n\nWhat is your opinion on the state of nature, is their any fallacies, or incongruent parts. where might if clash with the core values of different schools of anarchism if it does at all? how might one use it to talk about anarchism. this ethics - poli student thanks you in advance.",

But they take labor and resources to find. Prospecting for mines has a cost. And that cost must be paid. So a group sets up a prize. Whoever finds a diamond mine and gives us the information will get $10,000 (currency is irrelevant here, just using it as a measure).\n\nThe prospector finds a mine and tells the original miners, but also sells that information to a new set of miners. The two show up and now have a dispute about who has the right to use the mine. Then a third group of miners unrelated to the other two shows up, having found the mine themselves. The liberal went onto say you need a state to intervene and protect the first group's rights to the mine. I disagreed, but I thought this was an interesting case-study in occupancy and use and different ideas around it, and I would love to discuss! Who has rights to the mine?\n\n\\------------------------------------\n\nSome Thoughts:\n\nArguably, the first miners were \"using\" the mine via the prospector first. They have a valid claim. But the second group of miners were also \"using\" the mine when they paid the prospector for information. \n\nIt seems the best way to settle this dispute is to distribute the cost accordingly. So if miner group 1 paid 10,000, group 2 paid 5000 and group 3 paid nothing, the total cost = 10,000+5000 = 15,000.\n\nDivide that by the total number of miners. If anyone overpaid they get compensated by the others, if anyone underpaid they pay to meet that minimum. Then all three groups can use the mine and cost is split accordingly.\n\nAlternatively you could have the first group have exclusive rights for a while, then first and second, and then everyone in account of the money each paid.\n\nWhat do you think most fits with the idea of occupancy and use norms?

It seems to me like the whole idea of that community is based on the existence on some nebulous, innate \"gender\" which is, in sort, akeen to a soul. The (liberal?) trans community seems to want this \"gender\" to exist and they seem to believe that it, inevitably, decides a lot about a person despite at the same time wanting freedom of gender expression. However, this idea is only useful to protect binary trans people at the expense of women, which includes trans women and the unique ways in which they are oppressed by the patriarchy. Meaning that, really, it does not help trans people at all.\n\nDo you agree with this or do you find holes in the argument?

  "selftext": "*TL;DR: 3 preface paragraphs, main question in bold below*\n\nMy overarching goal is to make an autonomous social center somewhere in the general vicinity of my city/town. I noticed that a lot of my favorite volunteer run/diy/donation based venues that have come to pass always rented out their space. Needing to make ends meet off the very community they wished to service. Whether that's musicians/music fans, artists, etc. Don't get me wrong I value the time and effort of anyone making community spaces but the gist of always needing to churn people in and out of the space gets to me. Seeing when rent can't be met and needing to forfeit the space was a contradiction I wanted to avoid.\n\nThat turned me onto housing co-ops, which I tried establishing from scratch on 2 seperate occasions in 2020/21 by bringing people together around the idea of having a semi-public/common area closed off from the rest of the home (for safety/privacy of the residents) that would act as the social center. I can get into my experience giving this a shot and why I am likely not taking this route moving forward but that is outside the scope of this question (feel free to ask though).\n\nSo now I am just planning on owning a home that is mixed-use, ideally. Basically like a shop-keep I will live in the upstairs of the home and the downstairs will be an open space to run the center. Pulling the right strings/making relations I could probably get-by affording it just like a homeowner would; but with a space that's essentially an event center I have been considering the possibility of renting it out to any 3rd parties who need a gathering space for their events.\n\n\n\n**Main Question:** \n\nWould renting out my space like an events-center business be in line with anarchist praxis? I would love to be able to afford a building on my own/with someone and let it be free to use just with simple scheduling/reservations, but I don't necessarily see that being too feasible alone. I feel like pocketing that kind of money is landlord-like? Would it be possible to create some form of financial arrangement where the collected rent essentially re-funds the community by only using it for the continuation/development of the space rather than as a means to generate my own profit/mortgage?",

What i mean is when people refer to words like \"islamophobia\" and using that as a way to call people out or whatever the case may be. \n\nIm personally torn on this, i acknowledge that there are prejudice against people through religion that also is closely tied to racism. But i personally dont know if i can honestly believe something like islamophobia is a real concept i need to advocate against.

  "selftext": "Hello, I just read through the Solution of the Social Problem (the whole pamphlet, not just the chapter of the same name), and I have a few questions for neo-Proudhonists just to make sure I'm not misinterpreting Proudhon:\n\n1. Proudhon seems to rely on governmental methods several times through this work. For example under *Bank of Exchange*, he said:\n\n>A hundred thousand manufacturers, miners, merchants, commissioners, public carriers, agriculturists, etc., throughout France, unite with each other in obedience to the summons of the government and by simple authentic declaration, inserted in the Moniteur newspaper, bind themselves respectively and reciprocally to adhere to the statutes of the Bank of Exchange\n\nAnd then he goes on to say\n\n>The Bank of France, become the Bank of Exchange, is an institution of public interest.\n\nIt is placed under the guardianship of the state and is directed by delegates from all the branches of industry.\n\nI've heard that at this time, Proudhon had not arrived at a consistent anarchist theory of social change and so was still suggesting statist and governmental methods. Is that what we should understand these as? Or when he says state, does he mean the 'citizen-state'? Or is this a case of interpreting his proposal too much in favor of the anarchic ideal when he is trying to give a concrete and practical solution to a problem in his day?\n\n2. It seems like his Bank of Exchange has plenty of rules, which I thought are not consistently anarchist. Or are these norms based upon the ability of people to voluntarily disassociate from the Bank? For example:\n\n>The General Assembly shall meet on the first day of May of every year.  \n>  \n>Its order of business shall be:  \nTo hear the statement of the Board of Directors.  \nTo hear the report of the Council of Surveillance.  \nTo adopt, reject or modify this report.  \nTo proceed with the election of members of the Board of Directors.  \nTo elect the new delegates for membership of the Council of Surveillance.  \nTo ratify the applications for loans made to the Association either by individuals or by companies, or by the State.  \nTo regulate the rate of discount for the coming year.  \n**The convocation and sessions of the General Assembly shall be governed by the rules ordinarily in use by commercial assemblies. A two-thirds majority shall rule.**\n\nwhich reads like rules to me, though I feel like I'm misunderstanding.\n\n3. Is there any mangling in the translations? I used the [translation here](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/pierre-joseph-proudhon-the-solution-of-the-social-problem).",

  "selftext": "Recently had someone throw Bakunin's 'bootmaker' quote at me while trying to defend a point they'd challenged me on. This got me thinking about how the word 'authority' is used in that passage and I was hoping some of you might help clarify my thoughts on this.\n\nThe word authority has two different meanings. The first and most widely used could be described as authority as '*power*' and the second could be described as authority as '*expertise*'. That could also be expressed as the difference between someone *having* authority and someone *being* an authority.\n\nThat's a reasonably simple line to draw but it becomes more complex when you accept there could be a correlation between the two definitions e.g. the more someone is an authority because of their *expertise* \\- the more chance they might end up having authority as *power*.\n\nThis might seem like a purely semantic distinction but it means that statements like *'anarchists are against all forms of authority'* are not as literally correct as they might first seem because we're against authority as *power* not authority as *expertise*.\n\nBakunin seems to acknowledge this when he says: \"*Does it follow that I reject all authority? Far from me such a thought.*\" i.e. He does not reject *all* authority.\n\nAnd he continues with: \"*In the matter of boots, I refer to the authority of the bootmaker*\" i.e. He accepts 'authority as expertise'.\n\nBut then he finishes with: \"*But I allow neither the bootmaker nor the architect nor savant to impose his authority upon me.*\" i.e. He rejects 'authority as power'.\n\nWe could take this further with the idea that 'authority as power' could be described as the *hierarchical* form of authority and 'authority as expertise' could be described as the *non-hierarchical* form because 'authority as power' most likely needs a hierarchy to exist but 'authority as expertise' does not.\n\nThis is important for those of us who are against all forms of hierarchy in anarchism because - by definition - it includes 'authority as power' and excludes 'authority as expertise'.\n\nOf course - Bakunin doesn't explicitly clarify any difference in his use of the word authority and I admit this sort of semantic ambiguity is an autistic special interest for me - so my assessment may well be wrong.\n\nThoughts?",

I was simply asking if certain boundaries, even cheating, can seem controlling to a point that it becomes antithetical to an anarchist’s beliefs, leading them to more likely pursue relationships with people beyond their partner(s).\n\nThis question (more like questions) may be strange compared to what’s usually asked, but since I haven’t seen anything similar on the sub I thought it might be interesting to ask.\n\nBy this question, I mainly ask how it differs from what we usually see today. Commonly, two people who love each other after some time will get married. It’s *generally* forbidden to cheat, and boundaries may sometimes seem as though they can be very controlling.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I would be devastated if my partner cheated on me, and I would hate myself forever if I cheated on them. Cheating, though, is only a thing because many people view their partners as their own. Love itself becomes property that the significant other subconsciously views as their own. Yes, it is also that an exclusive relationship doubles as a promise to be “loyal,” but loyalty itself almost seems incompatible with anarchism to an extent. Do any of y’all (anarchists) see it in a different way? Are anarchists more willing to be in open relationships (specifically because of their philosophy)?\n\nWould marriage, often a religious ceremony, still be favored by some anarchists? What would that even look like? Just a ceremony to celebrate forever with someone?\n\nAt the end of the day, this is just meant for a discussion on something not usually associated with politics/economics. I imagine we’ll all have very different answers because love is not something philosophy could describe, at least fully. I’d love to see what y’all think. So many aspects to a relationship, if y’all can talk about your own experiences and how they seem unique *as a result of being anarchists* feel free to talk about it. Thanks!",

  "selftext": "with regulation I mean, a voluntary system where people try to minimize the risks of weapons.\n\nSo, I'm coming from the premise that most of us live in places with weapon arsenals, they only are accessible by police. Guns and other weapons will be necessary to remove armed power imbalances and maintain anarchy. So, I believe most places will still have to have a weapon arsenal.\n\nHowever, in order to avoid power imbalances an universal access to it must be granted.\n\nHowever, I feel like access still can't be unrestricted, even in anarchist society, weapon abuse can't be completely cut out.\n\nHow would the restrictions be performed without creating a power imbalance? Would it be something like jury duty where members of society regularly and randomly rotate in and out of restriction oversight?\n\nEven it that case, what about the temporary power imbalance that exists during \"jury duty\"? A group could coordinate and wait until most of them have \"jury duty\" on the same day and then occupy the weapon arsenal. \n\nI guess, the solution to that would be to have multiple arsenals distributed throughout an area and reducing the probability of such an event. I guess that answers that question, but feel free to share your thoughts on this anyway.\n\nWhat about storing weapons at home? I know that in praxis, it can't be really avoided and the only reason currently why most people don't store weapons at home is because they choose not to, but I do worry about the psychological effect this has on people. Currently we have the illusion of safety, due to police. But with no police (to be clear, I am all for that), what would be necessary to maintain trust within communities where individuals may carry guns or have them at home? I know that I would be somewhat paranoid and even currently, I always tense up when I see police or someone who carries a gun.\n\nI might be worrying too much about nothing, but I can't help to think that this could be an issue for others as well and could be a serious problem in maintaining anarchy in the long run.",

A train needs people to maintain them, people to drive them, people to build tracks for them, people to build the train itself, and so on. I know how this gets done with a government, in a functioning government I can go to them, tell them that my city needs trains, and then, with the voice and resources granted to them by they people, the government can yell out to the world and ask \"Who knows how to build trains?\", \"Who knows how tracks work?\", \"Who knows how to drive trains?\". And if they find those people, great! They can bring them together and with the resources the people give the government through taxes and that they can work together and build a city nice working trains. And even if they don't find those people they can ask \"Who wants to learn how to make trains?\", and then the government can give them the resources and have them research how to make trains, and then they can build those trains.\n\nWhat I'm confused with though is how that would work without said government, which (if functional) operates as a lens to focus the people's voice and resources in order to fix problems that no one person could fix on their own.\n\nIn an anarchist society who do I go to first? And how are all the people with their specializations able to first, know who else is involved, then gather the resources they need to build the trains, and know where to build the tracks and stops? Because a system like this would certainly end up beyond me who  first asked, how would the people over in another part of the city know that a train is being built in the first place, and then how would they be able to tell the train people that they could really use a stop over by them too?",

I'm a huge critic of anarchism but I don't want this to devolve into the typical mud-slinging bullshit between leftists so I want to pose some of my criticisms to you all directly to seriously consider your replies and better understand your point of view.\n\nIn an anarchist society there would be no hierarchies. However, if someone wanted to go against this established norm and establish a hierarchy (for example, a religious cult, or a mafia-style price fixing organization), how would an anarchist society stop it from taking over the society?\n\nExample, I start a jonestown-style cult and amass a small following. I then use my newfound power to coerce more people into joining, either through brainwashing, bribes, or just outright intimidation. The Anarchist commune would organize to try and stop what they would (correctly) see as a threat to its existence. However, the hierarchy I operate under would allow me to much more quickly and efficiently direct resources and effort into my project to create and expand my own influence as this messianic-like figure. The anarchist society on the other hand, without an organized military and social hierarchy, would have to face many more logistical obstacles and would rely on individuals deciding for themselves whether or not it's worth putting their lives at risk to try and stop this evil. \n\nMeanwhile, I can tell my followers to fight and die for me, without any regard for their own lives. I can ask them to give me their money, their things, their time and their manpower and leverage that to much more quickly amass a sizeable weapons arsenal. I can form alliances with other anti-anarchic groups to aid in the war effort. The anarchists on the other hand, have no structure, no centralized power source which to leverage.\n\nMaybe I fail, but my efforts will certainly inspire other power-hungry maniacs and one of them might eventually succeed. Is this not a fundamental flaw in an anarchist society? And if you set up some kind of emergency military committee to deal with emergencies like this, how do you ensure that the people you grant temporary powers to won't abuse their authority to keep those powers permanently?",

  "selftext": "I recently read a book by Thomas Ibanez talking about postanarchy and neo-anarchism. One of the issues i've always had with Anarchy is that it's pretty utopian to have a whole world system based on it (it's not utopian on a smaller scale). \n\nEdit: (The below paragraph has received some very constructive criticism. I still agree with Ibanez that the whole world following Anarchy is utopian I want to note 2 things. 1st of all. I'm not against figuring out ways to live in Anarchistic systems (TAZ's and PAZ's as mentioned below), just not on the scale of the while world. 2nd of all, the argument I gave ia flawed, however it is explained differently and much more coherently.in Ibanez's book. I'm unable to explain it, im just gonna have to urge you to read it. Anarchism is Movement. Can be found in the Anwrchist Library online.)\n \nIbanes gives a very good argument for this. Basically- Anarchism is based on freedom, in order to have a system around the world based on it everybody would have to be an Anarchist. That is highly improbabale so people not believing in anarchy would have to live in these systems even though they don't want to. And now it's not anarchy anymore since its not liberitarian.\n\nHe claims a much better option is post-anarchism. Basically, anarchism is based on fighting against opression therefore, as opression changes, so does anarchism. In today's world we have to relish ourselves in the utopia of an anarchist world without believing in it, considering it's unrealistic. Instead of waiting for the great revolution we make our life and our fight, a revolution. We use anarchism primarily, as a: force fighting against opression, and a building block of grasroot structures. PAZ'S, TAZ'S (Permanently and Temporary Autonomous Zones), squats, FNB, community gardens, etc.\n\nThis is clearly a quite radical take since it says that what the 'original' anarchism was based on (the idea of a functioning anarchist world), won't work today. I'm starting to lean towards agreeing with this thesis the more i read and think about it. However, i want to hear your thoughts. What do you think about post-anarchism? Maybe recommend me some lectures on it?",

  "title": "Credit, debt, tally sticks and gift economies",
  "selftext": "I've recently been exploring the interplay between ideas of various schools of anarchist thought. As of late, I've been particularly interested in the gift economies of the communists, and the mutual credit/debt systems of the mutualists and how that relates to the history of debt/money. This lead me to post the following in r/AskAnthropology (where I figured folks more familiar with David Graeber than I could comment).\n\n>My understanding of a gift economy is basically the idea that you give without the expectation of receiving anything in return.Now, the idea of participating in a gift economy makes sense. Sure I can give without the expectation of that gift being renumerated but that also means I can expect to receive without having to give anything. Of course, if you aren't giving to the community you lose social standing and may not get the best stuff. Everyone has an incentive to give because everyone wants to receive. While any individual gift may not get reciprocation, you can expect that by participating in the network you get what you want as well.  \n>  \n>I suppose in a way you can think of a gift economy as an informal debt/credit system. So I take out of the system by consuming. That creates a debt. I add to the system by giving gifts, that creates credit (i.e. I am worthy of trust that I will produce for you). If people have a general sense you take more than you can provide they may dislike you or you lose standing in the community.  \n>  \n>So the question I have is: what role did tally sticks play? Graeber discusses tally sticks as a way of keeping/marking debts. So like, if I give you shoes now, I expect something of equal or greater value in the future. You can denominate that value in silver or gold or cloth or whatever, but it doesn't have to be paid in silver, gold, or cloth. It's a way of trading on credit with a unit of account.These tally sticks arose before coins (i think). So effectively they were a way of making debts transferable and measurable.  \n>  \n>So my question is: what advantages did this provide compared to a traditional gift economy, if any?  \n>  \n>Why do you need to measure debts or make them transferable?My guess would be that this enables a more formalized system of debt collection and reliability. This could enable a) dispute resolution and b) perhaps enable larger gift economy networks? I.e. I don't have to personally know everyone in the network cause I do trust that the people I do know in the next town over will accept this tally stick from a member I don't know? Something like that?I'm not sure, would love input. Why use tally sticks as opposed to solely gift based organizing?\n\nTo rephrase in anarchist schools of thoughts:\n\nMutual credit and gift economy organizing strike me as remarkably similar. The basic idea is that i contribute to the network and I can expect that in the future I will be able to take out of the network.\n\nMutual credit does this by measuring labor contribution in labor-for-labor exchanges (so like, I go to the time store  (a la josiah warren) and get a shoe that took 30 minutes to make. I give the storekeep a pledge to do 30 minutes of labor in my field of work like farming. Later someone (storekeep or otherwise) comes and redeems that note. I do 30 minutes of farm labor and give them the produce). Gift economies do this much more informally (You helped me get new shoes. Later on I contribute back to the community by working on the farm and sharing the bounty with the shoemaker and other members of the community who provide other stuff to me).\n\nTally sticks are a way of measuring debts and making them transferable, in a similar way to mutual credit. Tally sticks are sorta a stand in for mutual credit in the above post.\n\nAs far as I can tell, mutual credit is a more formalized and quantified gift economy. Which is fine, I just wonder why mutualists prefer that quantitive element and communists prefer the informal element. What are the benefits/downsides of each approach?",

  "selftext": "Title. I'm an anarchist, but I've been reading a lot of Marx and I find his economic critique to be very compelling. I also agree with his theory of dialectical and historical materialism. However, I disagree with his goal of seizing state power during the transition to communism. Nonetheless, it seems to me like this is actually a pretty minor part of his overall views, and he actually changed his views a lot after the Paris Commune. His split with Bakunin seems to have been based on several miscommunications, and the actual differences between their views seem pretty minor to me.\n\nDoes this make me a Marxist? And if so, am I still an anarchist, or another type of libertarian socialist?\n\nEdit: The main reason I asked this question is because \"Marxism\", in economics, just refers to Marx's economic critique of capitalism. Since I agree with that, which makes me a \"Marxist\" in the economic sense, I was wondering if I could still be considered an anarchist. It looks like the answer is yes, based on people's responses so far. (I wasn't trying to ask whether an anarchist could agree with the seizing of state power, of course that's a no.)",

  "selftext": "I’ve been involved in anarchist organizing directly for a little over half a year now, starting in February/march when I helped organize some solidarity actions with the stop cop city campaign. Since then things have felt pretty steady, I’ve been doing stuff consistently (helping various mutual aid orgs, going to rallies/marches sometimes, and occasionally helping my friends with direct actions) and until very recently haven’t felt too overwhelmed. I kept hearing about burnout and sorta didn’t understand it. I figured either I was less susceptible to it than other people or I’d just found a level of engagement which would allow me to stay below the burnout threshold. Since Israel started its new carpet bombing campaign in Gaza a few weeks ago, that’s all changed. I’ve been doing a lot of organizing stuff on my college campus and going to all the major protests in my city and for a while it felt pretty good. I was hyped up, and felt like I could keep doing it forever. Things were shifting, though. Where before I only helped out with things when I felt like I had capacity, now I was doing things literally regardless of any personal commitments. My grades were suffering, I started missing classes regularly and distancing myself from friends, things were going well with the girl I liked before and now I haven’t talked to her in like a week and a half, I was supposed to be making a DND campaign for my friends and that’s gone completely the fuck out the window. Despite all that I kept barreling forward, and managed to ignore the rapidly growing problems until today, which was the first time I missed a protest/direct action since October 8th. As soon as my momentum stalled I was confronted with the fact that I can’t keep up this pace. I’m going to burn out soon, if I haven’t already. I’m still angry and I don’t want to stop, especially as we’re going into an election year and things are only going to get more intense from here, but it needs to be sustainable. Does anyone who’s been in the fight longer than me have advice about how to avoid burnout and/or deal with it when it happens to you?\n\nTLDR: doing organizing around what’s happening in Gaza is rapidly burning me out, how do I avoid burning out completely, and what’s a level of engagement which can reasonably be kept up?",

  "selftext": "What factors prevent planned obsolescence in socialist or anarchist markets? To what extent is it caused by state control within capitalist ones?  \n\n\nMy personal guess is as follows but I would love to hear your input/if I got something wrong.  \n\n\nPlanned obsolescence is more common in uncompetitive markets (i.e. if there's like 5 sellers they can collude to lower lifetimes of products). This concentration if market power is only possible due to state interference with things like patents, state subsidies to corporate power, etc.  \n\n\nIn an anarchist context no market agent could get to be large enough to dominate like that.  \nFurthermore, anarchist markets and mutual credit systems require us to rethink how we view production. Basically, think of consumption as debt and labor as credit. So by consuming products, you are taking out of the system, and by doing labor you are putting into the system.  \nIf you want to consume more you basically just take on more debt which will be matched by more labor. You don't need to \"sell\" in the same way capitalists do. What you instead do is pledge to do labor in the future and in exchange you get to consume now.  \n\n\nCapitalists markets don't work like that. Instead they require you pay interest on credit as credit is monopolized by the financial class.  \n\n\nThis means that if I were to pledge services in the future I would have to pledge what I consume + interest. And that means that it's more expensive to take the loan out rather than just get the money myself. So a better strategy is to convince others to give me money in exchange for a service, and the more people I convince the more money I get and the more I can consume. On top of that I need to convince the capitalists who own the MOP to continue to allow me to use it, so I need to maintain high profits, as the capitalists face the same dilemma I do.  \n\n\nWithin an anarchist context you don't have to do that as there is no interest and no need to meet capitalist profit demands. In the absence of capitalist private property (and therefore profit) and interest, a debt-credit model of consumption becomes more dominant and that's based on offering actual services and not mere property.  \n\n\nOn top of that, the \"firm\" doesn't really exist anymore. So like, say a community needs widgets. They can either look for other communities that make widgets or they can finance the creation of their own widget factory. They'll go with whatever the cheaper option is. Let's say that it's the widget factory. So the community comes together to finance the thing, and then they look to people who have pledged to do labor in exchange for consumption. They call up these debts, people work at the factory. The community allocates labor according to its needs. The factory isn't a \"firm\". It's owned by the community and the people working there are doing so on credit for previous consumption. It's not seeking to maximize profit, but rather meet community needs.\n\nIs that more or less correct?",

  "selftext": "Hello, I am a Marxist. A Marxist what? Just Marxist, I prefer simplicity. I have read the State and Revolution recently so I am at least proud of that accomplishment as an AuDHDer. Lenin makes many good points in my opinion. But that is beyond the point of this question. The point of this question is to understand some of the developments I may have missed due to not actually knowing much about Anarchist thought, as from what I hear seems to occasionally be contradictory. I thought the horse's mouth itself may provide the most interesting thoughts because I myself am trying to figure out how to create an analysis of alienation in regards to digital age. This is probably a little broad but I come here entirely good faith. How much has anarchist thought analysed alienation in regards to our digital age and where exactly can I find such information? It would be useful to compare notes essentially. lol\n\nGenerally the issue I find among ML circles is how its a field very much based on respected figures with lengthy careers. Usually people not young enough to truly understand the implications of the internet. And it has just hit me... Anarchists probably have already extensively covered these questions just as a consequence of decentralised distribution of information. Something also tells me anarchists have better adjusted to the digital period simply due to their organisation not being entirely stifled and imploded along with the USSR. So this means I imagine anarchist circles were entirely unaffected and likely quite healthy during these times. Hence I wish to tap into tap into such a knowledge base to get useful ideas and concepts. One other key issue is accessibility, and something tells me anarchists are also fairly decent at this simply because of the same phenomenon found in all segments of anti-capitalist ideology and that is being overflown with neurodivergents and disabled folks generally who are especially more vulnerable to becoming lumpenproles. And due to this disabled people tendency towards anti-capitalism... perhaps this means anarchist literature is also more accessible.\n\nIf this question isn't concise enough about what I am asking for, blame it on the fact I haven't slept in a day. But it is also probably because I am not actually sure what I am looking for. I simply have the belief that refusing to at all engage with anarchist theory is a mistake on part of Marxists because the potential for knowledge swapping is immense.

  "selftext": "**CONTEXT:** I have diagnosed Autism. Very early childhood I was described as scoring very highly on Conner's Index for ADHD which I feel at the moment seems a terribly significant point. I wasn't diagnosed ADHD with the only reason I can tell being that \"I seemed to focus very intensely on anything I was interested in, any hobbies that I had.\" (what I read on my records)\n\nI feel this question is related to Anarchism because I feel I have a very deeply Anarchist way of learning and approaching the work I do.\n\n(I'd gotten the highest grade for Mathematics and second highest grade for Applied Mathematics once I'd left secondary school)\n\n**Self-directed learning:**Developing my own learning goals, obtaining my own resources/materials, working towards the goal I had and ensuring I completed all the personal tasks/activities I set out for myself.\n\n**Active-participation:**Everything just makes 10,000% more sense to me if I'm actively participating in engaging with hands-on work such as exercises that I can self-correct/self-check using resources for feedback and being allowed to work with concepts in a collective setting. Really well-written books that require me to perform complex skills feels like a two-way conversation. (here's the key programming concepts, a discussion on those concepts, here's some exercises to do to fully learn the concept)Nothing better but collaborating with other people rather than just being told stuff.\n\n**Hands-on:**Having something to do with my hands. Metalwork and Technical Graphics were amazing subjects for this. So is anything that can be made active. Mathematics, Programming, etc. Keyword though is I'm actively using the concepts because I tend to feel completely overloaded and everything just turns into fancy nice-looking symbols on the page and it doesn't make sense anymore and I've got a bad headache now if I'm not allowed to actively engage and work with the ideas presented. And I'm also extremely restless, uncomfortable, fidgety, squirmy, distractable, hyperactive, zoned out... (uuf)I am resorting to teaching myself a lot of the Linear Algebra and Programming at the moment which combines the hands-on approach with the self-directed learning approach which works way better for me because I don't feel overloaded and I can happily just intensely/lazer focus on what I'm doing and it feels like I'm getting so much done. Which tends to give me the encouragement I need to feel motivated and rewarded so I'm currently at the stage of building the inertia to just non-stop keep going at it. I feel I'll need to add Calculus and Mechanics to the list.\n\nI'm using this books:\n\n1. Shaum's Outlines for Linear Algebra, 4th Edition\n2. Learn Python With Jupyter",

  "title": "Feeling hypocritical regarding my job and my anarchist principles",
  "selftext": "I work in a mental health rehab. My patients have all been sectioned under the UK mental health act - meaning that they have been detained for presenting a danger to themselves or others (usually because of either violence, self-harm/suicide, or self-neglect). It isn't a prison, the intention is rehab, not punishment, and a big part of what I do is to help them work towards their discharge. But their stay is usually not voluntary, and there are definite rules and hierarchies in place that I take part in and sometimes help to enforce.\n\n\nI'm going to bullet point a lot of my thoughts since I don't want to write an essay. This won't be particularly coherent. I don't know what I'm trying to get at, I guess I'm just looking for opinions on how to best balance things. Don't be afraid to call me out if I need it.\n\n\nFirstly, I know that working any job means participating in hierarchies. It's necessary to survive, I don't want to be the \"but you participate in capitalism\" guy. But there's a difference between being a builder or something and working somewhere with locks on the doors where you're trained in restraints.\n\n\nSome of what I/the hospital does - helping with symptoms of mental illness, either through medication or psychology and coping strategies. Teaching life skills that they may be lacking. Stuff like cooking, cleaning, budgeting, and also less obvious stuff like coping in public. Some patients are quite institutionalised, so getting them out into the community as much as possible really helps. Otherwise it's mostly just looking after them/keeping them occupied until the professional team decides they're ready to go.\n\n\nThe conditions for detention are based in capitalism. I don't know how to word that better. But while the majority of my patients would likely hurt themselves or other people if they weren't detained, there are some where the only reason they can't safely live outside of hospital is that they can't hold a job, or they can't manage money, or they have drug addictions (quite often started because of pain inflicted by capitalism). Unfortunately with the world we live in that does mean that they need help, and this is the form that the help currently takes.\n\n\nI feel like a hypocrite because I live the life that I'm denying them. Not just things like going out whenever I want but things like drinking alcohol or smoking weed. If one of my patients got caught high or drunk then they would face consequences (a lot of which are the parts of the job that I quite strongly disagree with, restricted leave and stuff) whereas I get home from work and light up a joint.\n\n\nThe \"just following orders\" argument. I agree that it's bullshit, I don't write the rules but I choose to work in a job where I enforce them. I guess I'm arguing against myself here.\n\n\nThings I do to try and help/act like an anarchist and not a tool for the system. The biggest one, I actually make an effort. Some people I work with only see what they do as a job, they forget that they're working with people, and I never want to be like that. I listen, I explain to patients what's going on if they want to know, I push to get things moving for them. I try to facilitate as much leave and activities and stuff as I can for them, I don't restrict things just because there's a risk that something could \"go wrong\". Sometimes I'm limited by what my bosses allow, which really sucks because I can't afford to lose my job, but I try to do as much as I reasonably can. Also, I turn a blind eye to small rule breaks. Again I'm limited by trying to keep my job, so I can't look past drugs and stuff, but things like arriving back from leave ten minutes late I'll let slide.\n\n\nAn argument I see a lot around jobs and stuff is \"this job will exist either way, so who else will do it if not you\". I guess it's the same as voting for the least harmful party in elections despite them still being bastards. That argument will only take me so far, I'd never be a policeman or something, but I suppose the good outweighs the bad here and I'd rather someone like myself is looking out for these patients.\n\n\nTwo big debates that are relevant but I'm not sure I've got the energy to get into them. One is suicide. I fully support euthanasia and I think that if somebody wants to take their life then that's their decision. But when I'm at work and I see somebody with a ligature around their neck I sound the alarm and cut it off them. Somebody will be screaming at me to let them die and I'll be holding their arms while a nurse sedates them. It's difficult because obviously I don't want them to die, and often they will say afterwards that they don't really want to die either. I guess as well, if the suicidal feelings are treatable then it also complicates the question.\n\n\nThe other big debate is capacity. Some patients have been assessed to not have the capacity to make decisions around their life/care. I'm not sure how to group together a lack of capacity with anarchy, is it wrong of me/my team to make decisions on behalf of someone who can't understand the question if we have their best interests at heart?\n\n\nI won't be answering comments for a few hours as I'm about to go to sleep but I'll read everything and answer what I have time for in the morning. Sorry it's chaotic but I hope I'm getting my thoughts across.",

  "selftext": "Hi folks\n\nI would like to know the opinions of other anarchists regarding music. In my close group of friends who consider themselves anarchists, they mostly listen to Progressive Rock/Metal, Industrial Music, and Jazz, which contrasts quite a bit with the anarchist stereotype associated more with Punk music (although Industrial music could be considered a type of Progressive Punk). So, I asked them about their perspective as anarchists on music. They told me that when they started reading about anarchism, they became interested in jazz. One of them said:\n\n>*\"I think I embraced jazz at the same pace as anarchism because they share identical philosophies and a similar historical context.\" That avant-garde, improvisational, and independent style among jazz band musicians, even if they belong to the same group, they don't follow a central style; each of them adds a personal style and feeling. Each of them contributes to the same melody independently and simultaneously. It fills my heart with joy every time I see jazz bands and think that humans can truly be mutually independent and create great masterpieces.\"*\n\nI remember hearing about anarchist jazz as a literary genre, but I couldn't find much more about it. Well, the response melted my heart, and I'd love to know the views of other anarchists regarding the music they listen to or if you think anarchism changed your perspective on music. \n\nI want to clarify that I'm not implying that if you don't like jazz or another genre, you're not a true anarchist. It's more of a reflection on anarchy in music.",

  "selftext": "To be spesific, I don’t mean people that are mainly disabled by capitalist society. I mean people that require high levels of assistance, are unable to contribute and can be very difficult to care for on a physical or emotional level. For example things like throwing feces, violence, inappropriate sexual behaviour, where people genuinely do not understand or will not accept to behave in an \"appropriate\" manner due to any number of potential issues.\n\nThe idea I’ve seen (mainly from self described nihilists and egoists) is that disabled people will be taken care of because humans feel good helping each other. This seems to ignore the reality faced by many disabled people. Where the more help you need and the more openly affected you are, the less people want to be around you. People become severely disabled, non verbal and often the only people who hang around are payed to be there or motivated by \"spooks*\" like familial obligation, moral values, etc. (*this term is a racial slur where I’m from so a replacement would be appreciated if there is one.)\n\nFrom the responses to similar questions I’ve read it almost seems like anarchy would leave certain disabled people even more vulnerable than they are now. More dependant than ever on others who don’t have to help them. I know about historical cases of disabled people being cared for, but from what I know that’s more of an exception to the rule when it comes to high needs disability and doesn’t address disability as it exists with modern medicine. The only comment I saw about those that might not be able to integrate into society was proposing more of the same, like group homes. In general people seem to overestimate the role good will plays in getting people to do care work while ignoring hierarchy within medicine and how medical professionals are inherently in a position of power over disabled people in their care (many might as well be cops in the current system). \"We’re all interdependent\" responses don’t really address the issues facing uniquely vulnerable populations. \n\nI’m trying to understand more about different leftist beliefs and that’s been one of the issues I’ve had with anarchism compared to what I’ve seen from ML’s and other statists. Basically removing the mechanisms that allow for a hierarchical society is cool, but anarchism from what I understand can’t guarantee anything for disabled people. \n\nReading recommendations are appreciated, I’m still a beginner.

The specifics of any given mutualist's problems with neoclassical perspectives will probably depend on which economic theory or theories they prefer to use themselves, and often these have been some combination of classical political economy, bits of Marx, maybe little bits of Proudhon, and, in the case of Carson, some Austrianism. There's currently some interest in seeing where Sraffa could be useful which I think shows promise. I've been curious to see if institutional economics might have some compatibility; it appeals to my sociological training more. Both of those schools have their particular gripes with neoclassical marginalism.That all said, Mutualism is often seen as primarily being about economics and the Wikipedia page isn't really helping with that, but currently the big questions within mutualism are not really about economics specifically, but about social theory, which can be applied not only to economics, but sociology, anthropology, international relations, and so on. I think we still have a lot of work to do developing a neo-Proudhonian social theory and methodology before we will have a good and easily summarized mutualist critique of neoclassical economics that most mutualists could agree with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm curious as to what a good source to read up on that might be. Are there currently existing attempts to reconcile proudhonian and sraffian ideas? I've long been interested in sraffa, so would def love to see any attempts to merge his ideas into proudhon's. Or the role of institutional economics in proudhonian social science?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere can I find literature on modern takes on proudhonian ideas and their synthesis with other schools of thought?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have read *Studies in the Mutualist Political Economy* like the FAQ recommends.

As someone who has followed the Israel Palestine conflict since she was 10 years old and comes from a Muslim background, I have always seen Israel as a settler colonial state that oppresses Palestinians and is the primary aggressor in the conflict. Although I understand that Jews have been persecuted for thousands of years, that does not give them an excuse to colonize another group of people. Furthermore, I believe that Hamas isn't the best leadership for Palestinians considering they're a reactionary Islamist group; however, Hamas seems to be the only option for Palestinians atm since Hamas is seen as the only group who can help Palestinians resist settler colonialism. What are your thoughts on the situation and what do you think is the best solution for it? If you're a Palestinian anarchist, your opinion is even more valuable.",

  "selftext": "Not sure if this is the best place to ask, but I'm recently learning that the biggest union (the retail and fast food union, the SDA) in my country (Australia) isn't exactly the bastion of workers rights that it claims to be, so I've been doing a lot of digging on their largely pro business practices. But I'm also just wondering if how they're structured is typical for unions?\n\nBasically, working for SDA is a full time job. The job of an organiser is to just travel around, going store to store to get people to join the union, and try to recruit people as delegates of that store so they can also recruit their fellow workers. Organisers aren't also workers themselves, they only organise, it's their career.  \nMy understanding of unions is that they're formed by the workers in a given store/chain/industry, and it's the workers themselves that organise other workers.\n\nSo I guess I just wanna know, is any of this typical for larger scale unions? I know there are unions that exist external to workplaces that cover entire industries (like the UAW in the US), how are these structured? Are they run primarily by workers who do union activity in their free time, or is working primarily as a union organiser a common thing?\n\nThe SDA is also heavily involved with our centre left major political party, the Labor party, which has its history in unions and workers rights, but hasn't been very pro worker in quite a while. I know this isn't really a thing in the US, but is it common anywhere for unions to have strong connections with major political parties, with the ability to sway policy?\n\nIf I could have some sources or historical examples provided, that'd be super appreciated as well.

  "title": "Is Left-Rothbardianism a form of Market Anarchism/Free Market Anarchism?",
  "selftext": "I want to say first how something like Left-Wing Rothbardianism sounds like, it's pretty weird to me at least lol.\n\nRecentely i was studing some stuff about direct action in Market Anarchism and Anarcho-Individualism, such as illegalism and agorism. The second one took my atention, mainly because Samuel Konkin III considered himself as a \"Radical-Rothbardian\". I'm not gonna lie, Rothbard and his fellas always gave to me that vibe of \"ultra liberals reacionarians, almost like a far right thing\", but something like a \"Left wing rothbardianism\" make me fells like \"Wtf is this even possible?\". So i start to read\n\nI read this Kevin Karson article: [https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-the-left-rothbardians](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/kevin-carson-the-left-rothbardians)\n\nKevin Carson put in some parts of the article some declarations from Muray Rothbard made between 1965 and 1969, like that one:-\n\n\"But if Columbia University, what of General Dynamics? What of the myriad of corporations which are integral parts of the military-industrial complex, which not only get over half or sometimes virtually all their revenue from the government but also participate in mass murder? What are their credentials to “private” property? Surely less than zero. As eager lobbyists for these contracts and subsidies, as co-founders of the garrison stare, they deserve confiscation and reversion of their property to the genuine private sector as rapidly as possible. To say that their “private” property must be respected is to say that the property stolen by the horsethief and the murderer must be “respected.\"-\n\nAfter that point, Kevin Carson ending up the first part of the article saying:-\n\n\"To reinforce that impression, bear in mind that (as Hess’s remarks above on property suggest) Rothbard considered all land titles not traceable to a legitimate act of appropriation by human labor to be utterly null and void. That meant that titles to vacant and unimproved land were void, and all such land in the United States should be open to immediate homesteading. It meant all the real estate in Southern California currently held as real estate investments by the railroads, pursuant to the land grants of the nineteenth century, should immediately become the absolute freehold of those currently making rent or mortgage payments on it. It meant that all the land in the Third World currently “owned” by quasi-feudal landed oligarchies should immediately become the property of the peasants working it; and land currently being used by corporate agribusiness and other cash crop operations, in collusion with those same landlords, should be returned to the peasants who were evicted from it.\"-\n\nThis last point raised by Kevin Carson about Rothbardian theory reminded me, in parts, Mutualism and the Market Anarchism. In the end, would the Left Rothbardians can be considered as free market anarchists? From what i understand, they advocate for the end of state, the end of monopoly, the end of corporativism, the end of coerscion/control and are in favor of free association and individual property (I don't know much things from Market Anarchism though)\n\nSorry for my poor english",

  "selftext": "It sucks that r/Anarchism has disabled requests but I totally get it. 😩\n\nI would like to preface this by saying I have anarchist roots as a teen but found myself drifting away from anarchism over time as I grew older. \n\nSo here's what I wanted to discuss. Upon the dissolution of the state, you immediately run into a few problems:\r  \n\r  \n1. A lot of people don't care about the fate of minorities in their respective societies\r\r\n\n2. A disturbing number of people already blame people with deviating characteristics / worldviews for causing the exacerbated suffering resulting from capitalism's contradictions due to many decades of deeply ingrained propaganda - the politically correct, the academically-guided, and voices of reason and compassion would be unable to guide the development of society a large except for small pockets maybe, especially since most are pacifistic liberals used to compromise and collaboration with undesirable regimes\r  \n\r  \n3. A lot of people will be reluctant to participate in building completely unfamiliar alternative structures in governing society\r  \n\r  \n4. Because of community and family ties, the majority of people will likely align themselves under the guidance of \"warlords\" who already commanded a degree of authority from the previous social order\r  \n\r  \n5. Most people will probably move toward recreating social institutions that propagate the ideas they are familiar with:  \nprivate property  \ngenerational wealth  \nexclusive relationships to the means of production (thus leading to continued class distinction)  \noften religiously motivated social rules that subjugate women / control reproduction / repress bodily autonomy  \nsystematic oppression along ethnic / cultural / nationalistic lines by the majority or hegemonic group\r  \n\r  \n6. People who were victimized prior will be motivated to normalize punitive / vigilante justice\r  \n\r  \nThese obvious predictable outcomes have got me thinking of a few questions, and here are the conclusions I've come to:\r\n\n1.\r\n\nQ: Who's going to protect ethnic / gender / sexual minorities?\r  \n\r  \nA: You need a group upholding and enforcing values of inclusivity in a position of coercive power to protect them. Their values would need to be adopted by mainstream society in a short window of time... a process which cannot be free from coercion.\r  \n\r  \n2.\r  \n\r  \nQ: How do you ensure that the collapse of the state will not simply result in the purging of political radicals, such as - crucially - Anarchists?\n\nA: You need strong, enforced political cohesion to run a counter-propaganda project that will turn the first generation or two away from their previous programming under capitalism. But that's not enough because you want lasting protection from these groups not only for a short time!\r  \n\r  \nTherefore I think society should start seeing minorities, academics of the social sciences (oft targeted as \"naysayers\" and \"saboteurs\" under capitalism), and conscientious people who have a tendency to proselytize political correctness - with a degree of reverence, that they are the heart of a conscious society and their counsel should be considered in a lot of matters, that blaming them or not listening to them is something that leads to the reduction of quality in life in a society. I know this sounds borderline religious but I think it is necessary, and is one of the big points I have butted heads with Anarchists about.\r  \n\r  \n3, 4 & 5.\r  \n\r  \nQ: A few scattered tiny communes built on horizontal organization scavenging to survive and trying to keep on the down low to avoid rump government forces and agrarian warlords / oligarchic militias, will not have the flow of resources needed to bring the change necessary to improve the conditions of society. What preconditions would need this to not be the case after the capitalist state's removal?\r  \n\r  \nA: Ties into both 1 & 2. This is where I tend toward characteristics of a vanguardist approach toward exiting capitalism. You need to fully take control of the instrument of the state and make use of all of its appendages toward making rapid development in a short period of time, if only to the extent that is possible in the face of encroaching climate devastation. This may require the use of statist-aligned rhetoric and the illusion of political continuity, with a thoroughly anti-capitalist framework behind it. You will seize capital and make it managed for all society, but the populace - who are not yet ready for such an organizational change - will superficially see that it had to go through due legal process. See that enough people's lives may be saved through this and it generates widespread enough legitimacy among the populace for the ideology/ies of improving the human condition. At the same time, you have grassroots organizations spreading and normalizing the idea and practice of horizontal organization, where individuals don't auction their interests against one another but stand up to represent many who are in need.\r  \n\r  \nOne of my only major disagreements with Marxists - particularly those in the Leninist line - is their fetish for a national platform and geopolitical garbage.\r  \n\r  \n6.\r  \n\r  \nQ: Do you need to prevent the flare-up of vigilante/punitive justice in the event of a revolution?\r  \n\r  \nA: I think yes. The mental image that will be left behind by a revolution will shape its lasting legitimacy in the eyes of mainstream society. This is why I think the social order that steps in to fill the vacuum capitalism leaves behind needs to immediately implement methods of rehabilitative justice... this however technically means seizing the monopoly on violence to disarm and deter revenge militias who want to just execute individuals and groups.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, I think rehabilitative justice will be important in a hypothetical future of an improved human condition. There will always be people who have compulsions that can't be controlled. I think society will need the resources to build architecture, infrastructure and the administration to keep them in a place where they will be safe from themselves / others will be safe from them, where some of them may be able to safely put compulsions into practice in a virtual environment, while they are also taken care of... until such a time, if ever, that they can be fully rehabilitated and reformed. This is more desirable than punishment-based conditioning or - as a Trotskyist once suggested - exiling them into the jungle and shooting them if they try to come back 😨 (smh 😔).\r  \n\r  \nThoughts? I'm overall curious to what degree anarchists want *the entire human condition to change for all human beings*. Any degree at all or is it enough to stop living under capitalism?",

Things like \"what do we do about criminals\" and \"how do anarchists protect themselves against an invasion\" etc. Even I have had some questions like this in the past. I imagine it must get tiring for people to answer these kinds of questions so frequently. Is there not some sort of FAQ that compiles these kinds of questions?  \n\n\nWhat questions are you *tired* of seeing?  \n\n\nAlso, it seems to me like a lot of questions people have about anarchism are answered in texts like [Anarchy Works](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/peter-gelderloos-anarchy-works) and [An Anarchist FAQ](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-full), but I understand that pointing people who are unfamiliar with anarchist ideas towards a large text when they have questions may turn them away. I think this is especially the case when said text has a bunch of details instead of the-gist-of-it-is style answers. What are your thoughts on this? Do you agree or am I tripping?\n\n\n",

  "selftext": "Beforehand: If this doesn't make sense, or is confusing, I apologize, it's hard to put this question into words  \n\n\nOf course, spreading your beliefs can be done in a none obnoxious way in normal conversation or speaking up when something nonsensical/harmful is being said. (for example speaking up about racism or homophobia, etc.) I personally just do my own thing, living as an anarchist and supporting what I think is good, doing my own thing, being logical and respectful, etc.  \n\n\nBut about actual activism: does it not appear to be obnoxious? Not like it matters, because people often don't want to hear or accept things that might be more logical than their past beliefs or something they've been taught from a young age. It's great to be loud and open about what needs to be heard!!!  \nHowever, let me use religion as an example here: I personally dislike it when someone tries to push their personal religious agenda on me, I'm sure a lot of people dislike that. Of course it is fine to bring it up, talk to people about it, etc. But.. isn't activism kind of similar to that, though? Of course, we are advocating because WE want to, we don't do it for the church or any other organization (not saying all religious folk do it because of someone else!) , and we haven't (as it often is the case for people within religious groups or cults) been manipulated into something.  \n\n\nI feel like it would be hypocritical to dislike people advocating for their church but then try and tell people about anarchist beliefs. \n\nI am wondering this because I do think there is a difference here, because religion cannot really be proven, where as anarchism is probably just the most liberating way to exist without opression, etc. And I believe humans, as any other animals, are just naturally anarchist, since we are born as individuals, not to follow orders or rules under anybody/anything.  \n",

Therefore, you cannot escape the social element of art creation, even if you retreat to paint pictures alone in a mountaintop ashram until your dying day.\n\nOn this view, from my understanding, everything is a remix, and so claims to total \"originality\" are largely explained away. This forms the basis of anarchists' opposition to copyright, etc., and seems to stress the context in which the art was made.\n\nHowever, surely it would logically follow that anarchists oppose fine art, or are at least skeptical of the term? It seems to me that the definition of fine art - art made allegedly to express passion / love / aesthetics \"in-and-of-itself\" - makes whatever fine art *is* easier to alienate from the social context in which it was made. Behold this fine sculpture! Behold this rococo-framed painting! Who cares when, where, who by and under what socio-economic-political context it was made? It's *beautiful*!\n\nIn contrast, anarchist theories of art seem to stress art's social function, regardless of how \"abstract\" the art work itself *seems*.

They **reject** the idea of a **centralized authority** and **hierarchical power structures**.\n\nStates, regardless of their form, whether democracies or dictatorships, share fundamental attributes. They function as institutions responsible for **creating and enforcing laws within a designated territory**, ultimately **controlled by a minority**.\n\nIn a **capitalist society, the state operates akin to a business entity**. Its **prosperity hinges on the profitability of enterprises within its jurisdiction**. Tax collection serves as the primary means to finance its policies, with its core objective being the promotion of economic growth and profit. The state retains the capacity to **employ force,** whether against external threats or internal dissension, to uphold its policies.\n\nRegarding the state's involvement in areas such as **education, infrastructure development, and economic protectionism**, anarchists perceive these as **investments geared toward enhancing the state's profitability**. They view the presence of **welfare states and social services** as **concessions made** under duress due to **pressure from the working class**. These concessions are seen as a means to avert revolutions and maintain the societal machinery, rather than genuine acts of benevolence by the state.\n\nThroughout history, efforts by workers to **influence the state through political parties and revolutions** have proven **futile**. Even when in**itially aligned with the interests of the working class**, these movements eventually found themselves **compelled to prioritize economic competitiveness over the well-being of workers** in order to survive. Anarchists contend that the state invariably operates against the interests of the people.\n\nIn summary, anarchists oppose the existence of the state for several reasons:\n\n* The **concentration** of an **excessive amount of power and control** in the hands of a **minority**.\n* The inherent **contradiction between the state's objectives** within a capitalist economy (seeking more profits through maximum exploitation of workers) and the **interests of the people**.\n   * The state's inherent **incentive to reduce corporate taxes** rather than increase them.\n   * The state's **incentive to curtail social spending**, viewing it as a business expense.",

  "selftext": "So, no this isn't the \"how do people make grand decisions\" sorta thing, and is more, work place related. So, I like investigation stuff, and planes, to air crash investigation shows are something I enjoy, and... well they bring up a lot of questions at times when it comes to regs at the time (there's a reason they say it's written in blood). But, there have been various crashes because a group of workers thought they had found better ways to do things, or old rumors that probably weren't true. In these two examples; an airline maintenance crew not following how the manufacturer plan on how to remove the engines, instead removing the whole pylon and causing cracking in the mounts; and pilots belief that \"Ice Bridging\" was a thing meaning they were slow to deploy deicing gear; we see that the folks working in these areas ignored how something should be done with deadly consequences. With both these crashes leading to reg changes to prevent them in the future.  \n\n\nA less serious example would be railway brakemen originally hating full train breaking systems controlled from the engine, generally sighting not trusting them, even though they were way safer, or even today with various workers almost constantly annoyed by OSHA.  \n\n\nSo, my question is how would an anarchist society handle these kinda situations where workers are in the wrong in some way, shape, or form; or are the ones who would want to cut corners to get something done? I mean, if folks already will ignore regulations and things recommended by the the people making what they're working on what stops this from happening more often?",

This rush of flour has “exceeded the demand”— “prices have fallen”—twelve hundred barrels have spoiled in one man’s hands, and two thousand barrels are on their way back to  \n>  \n>the place of production! where, after having been stored and booked, and draped and shipped to  \n>  \n>New Orleans, and there unshipped and drayed, and stored and booked, and waiting for a demand,  \n>  \n>it is again drayed and shipped, and brought back to be unshipped, drayed, and stored and booked,  \n>  \n>and sold, half spoiled, to its original producers, for all its first cost, with all these expenses added,  \n>  \n>and as much more as the holders “can get.” This is the economy of our present profit-making  \n>  \n>commerce!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe part I want to focus on is: \"as far as they could anticipate them\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat happens when you cannot fully anticipate your needs?\n\nTake for example, something that happened to me on a road trip.\n\nI was with my family driving along when all of a sudden we get about 50 different warning lights and weird noises come from our car.\n\nWe pull over in the middle of nowhere and managed to find a mechanic across the street from a truck stop.\n\nWe spent like \\~6 hours getting the car fixed (the engine had fallen off its mountings and caused about 500 different issues in doing so).\n\nWe had no way of anticipating our need for a mechanic at that time as we had no idea our engine would fall out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means that the mechanic was effectively in a position to extort us if he wanted to (he didn't, super nice guy), or to use warren's words: he could have asked for a price based on what he expected it will bring. What is his incentive to follow the cost principle here when he is in a position of power over us (cause he knew how to fix our car and we didn't and we were stranded in the middle of nowhere with no other mechanic options)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow can the cost-principle be ensured in cases of unexpected demand?

I did, and I also found a great article on the cost principle on medium: [https://plutophrenia.medium.com/synopsis-of-the-cost-principle-46482793d505](https://plutophrenia.medium.com/synopsis-of-the-cost-principle-46482793d505)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne passage in this medium article made a lot of sense to me:\n\n>The Cost Principle demands a total restructuring of how a community deals with commerce. For value based commerce, supply is adjusted to the wants of the people based on the producers guessing how they can make the most money, that is to say, the fluctuating adaptations of supply to the demand. The constant guesswork on behalf of producers therefore produced enormous waste as excesses from production need to be disposed of. In cost based commerce, supply would be consciously adjusted to demand. People would communicate their wants, and production would follow accordingly. The Cost Principle would annihilate useless speculation. Although Warren didn’t have the terminology we are now purview to, what he is getting at is a primitive articulation of replacing the supply-push economy with a demand-pull one to accompany the Cost Principle.\n\nThis is obviously a better way of doing shit for a lot of reasons. 1) you get rid of useless speculation and waste. 2) you get rid of the incentive to artificially boost demand and to price gouge. In a supply-push economy you effectively are trying to sell as much of your inventory as you can. Any sudden surge in demand coupled with your limited supply means a higher price and higher rewards for you. That creates an incentive to surge demand. And that means that you have an incentive to do a lot of nefarious shit, from driving up fear or insecurities about looks, to funding misinformation and bullshit lies. If instead, demand comes first, and then supply follows, then you simply distribute the cost of production across more goods. The offloading of supply is a given because supply is determined by demand in the short run.\n\nSo I'd like to visualize the details on how a demand-push economy would actually work.\n\nBecause basically, for this to work, you need to know demand ahead of time, and then produce a supply accordingly. So how would that actually work? Would you like submit orders to a factory at the start of the month, they calculate how much material they need to in order to produce for that month, and then they split the cost of production evenly across their product? That makes sense to me.\n\nI suppose cost of production = material cost + wages for the month right? Josiah Warren's vision was the subjective cost of labor = wages.\n\nThat's fine and dandy.\n\nThe concern I have is as follows:\n\nLet's say we have a factory that can produce x products with its given workforce in a month. However, this month, demand is only for y products where y < x.\n\nWhat happens here?\n\nWell the cost of production will equal = material cost for y + wages.\n\nThe question is, how are wages determined?\n\nWell, Josiah warren suggested the subjective cost of labor. Since there is less labor needed this month, there's less subjective cost right?\n\nWell then, that means workers make less this month than they did before. Now they have an incentive to make sure that demand always meets x as this means that they get paid more. This creates the very problem I mentioned earlier, the nefarious attempts to artificially boost demand.\n\nAn alternative solution is that workers cost of living is covered as a form of wages, but then they're effectively wasting time when producing y products that could be used elsewhere. But what's the incentive to work elsewhere if they're getting paid the same regardless of labor? Furthermore, an interesting question opens up here. If we treat cost of living as fixed (stuff like housing, food, water, electricity, etc), then what can we say about discretionary income? Income that isn't needed but is used for fun or recreation? The obvious answer is the minimum needed to keep workers happy and keep them willing to return to work, but it's an interesting question of how that's determined.\n\nSo what's the solution here? I feel like it's a catch-22. You either pay the same every month and waste a lot of labor hours, or you pay according to subjective cost and then run the risk of under-capacity production creating an incentive to artificially boost demand.\n\nSee what I'm getting at?\n\nThe best solution I can see is that workers allocate their labor elsewhere in the case of under-capacity. They get paid the same and labor isn't wasted. But I'm not sure how that allocation would work? Like what do you do in that scenario?\n\nEdit:\n\nI realized my under capacity problem is basically a problem of supply push. I have a set number of labor hours in a month I am looking to offload.\n\n\nIf we treat the cost of labor as fixed: i.e. I need $m to maintain my lifestyle and be happy. The cost of that is going to be distributed over more or fewer goods depending on the production level.\n\nIf $m is too low I will move to another industry. If $m is too high, you attract more workers who are competed for fixed demand and that drives down wage to cost. Long term it evens out.\n\nIf you are in a high wage industry you have many competitors. In order to ensure your own high wages are met you can take a slightly lower one and attract all the customers. Sure your wage is lower but better than nothing right? Competitors must respond likewise until you reach the lowest wage you'll accept for the month. Personal subjective cost.\n\nYou could try and boost demand sure, but that doesn't solve the problem cause the issue is competitors not a lack of demand. Even if you boosted demand the same process would take place and boosting demand is rather expensive. You don't get more by producing more you just distribute higher production over more products. There's no real incentive to artificially boost demand \n\nShort term, there's no incentive to boost demand as demand is given before production and so you're not looking to offset a given supply. Supply is dependent on demand, not the other way around.",

  "title": "Economic coordination under anarchism",
  "selftext": "So i've been thinking about ways to ensure the interests of all parties affected by the usage of a commonly held resource have a say in decision making. If we have social ownership of the MOP it makes sense that anyone affected by production should have a say in how it is run. You want to ensure no central planner, as that would result in a huge concentration of power and inevitable bureaucracy. This is true for USSR style states and capitalist coorporations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i imagine is different cooperatives/councils/collectives representing different interest groups basically come together and negotiate an outcome. So, say we have a factory on a river. The workers in that factory constitute one interest group, consumers of the products of that factory (whether they be average people or other factories/worker cooperatives) constitute another interest group, and people living on and using the river constitute a third interest group. In order to keep consumers consuming production of the factory, workers must keep them happy. In order to avoid sabotage or large scale action collectively taken by river-people the workers must listen to the folks living on and using the river, and finally the workers themselves need to be made happy in order to keep producing product. In essence, we have three different collectives that can meet at set times to negotiate production quotas, compensation for externalities, prices, working hours, etc. No one party has more power than the other as all parties need one another (without workers consumers don't get product, without consumers workers don't get compensation, without workers the river people lose out on control of something happening on their river, etc). All parties have a stake in finding a compromise. Thus you effectively have a decentralized system for negotiating coordination between workers, consumers, and all other stakeholders.\n\nNo one central planner is needed here as the consumers of the product of a factory and the workers of that factory can negotiate their own deal. Essentially the entire economy would be based around different collectives of workers and consumers negotiating deals with one another. A worker in one context would be a consumer in another. And of course, any stakeholder would have a say. I can imagine a giant collective for managing air pollution and the like for example that would be involved in negotiating deals with workers and consumers.\n\nNew institutions would be created through community owned trusts or collectively managed resource allocation tools (i imagine workers and consumers would pool resources together for the establishment of mutually beneficial institutions). Without a class of people who own all the resources, and a state to protect them, negotiations would be on equal terms and therefore couldn't be exploitative.\n\nThe internal structure of these collectives can vary, from elections, to rotating members, to whatever else suits your fancy. Point is that groups of people who share a common interest unite into a collectively owned institution that negotiates with other institutions.\n\nIs there a model of anarchism that fits this bill? What do you think of this idea? To me it seems to nicely balance the interests of all members of the working class. Consumers and workers are both members of the working class (usually anyways, not necessarily so in capitalism but in socialism they would be). Furthermore this helps prevent externalities being offset onto anyone else and ensures that all members of the community contribute to decision making and whatnot.\n\nDoes this fit the bill for anarchy? It seems to eliminate hierarchy to the greatest possible extent and works in a decentralized and mutually beneficial manner.",

It is shameful that Nazis and other unsavory right-wing groups have claimed this rejection of authority as their own, even though many of them are *complete cocksuckers of hierarchies*.\n\nDo you think we could ever “steal” symbols from them, like the garrison flag? Or is the symbol in itself hypocritical/controversial? I understand the American revolution was far from the narrative we’re fed in school here in the States. The Founding Fathers were all businessmen whose wealth was being harmed by the crown, and they seceded from it mostly for that reason. But, most of the people who took up arms against the British were the average proletariat, such as you or I, and they truly believed in creating a “freer society.” These people became united as a militia and used the garrison flag to spell it out to the king that *they were pissed and would do anything for a freer society*.\n\nBut, again, to close: would it be possible to reclaim this symbol (and other symbols) as one of the true revolutionary, the progressive revolutionary, of the true lovers of “liberty and justice for all” (forgive me being a cornball at the end)? If I’m completely out of line in this way of thinking, please let me know. I’m really trying to educate myself more on anarchism and trying to find out what I can do to lessen—and eventually destroy—the oppression felt by my fellow humans.",

  "selftext": "So I have noticed in a lot of anarchist spaces(mostly online) that there is still I fighting and a sort of dogmatism between individualist and social anarchist factions. More specifically, the radical nihilist anarchists and the platformists anarcho communists. \nOn one side there are the nihilists who despite being anti capitalists still declare themselves to be anti socialists and consider socialism a \"hierarchical collectivist ideology\".\nAnd on the other side we have the platformists that belive that communism is the only form of anarchism that should be pursued and everything else rejected, when we know that realistically an anarchist society while socialist in economy wouldn't have a set economic model or set way of doing things as different communities and confederations may try different things and still coexist. \nIn conversations I've had i've noticed that both sides seem to consider the other side as \"not true anarchists\" and that only their side is how anarchy is supposed to be.\nMy question is, shouldn't we know better in this day and age that infighting leads us nowhere? I expect that anarchists of today are aware that there isn't a set specific way of doing anarchism and that in the end we all want the same thing so we might as well work together. That the individualism vs collectivism debate is just a false dichotomy that takes us nowhere as no matter if you're individualist or collectivist we all still strive for individual liberty and collective well-being. \nNow I will acknowledge that maybe I'm just looking ar a loud minority and that the majority of anarchists likely don't engage in this infighting as I've seen plenty other anarchists(me included) who just accept that we all have our differences but want the same thing in the end and are just cool about it. Still, it surprises me that a division that should have been dead long ago is still alive today when it provides nothing for the movement and in long term even harms it(See for example the Japan anarchist movement that was devastated by the infighting between communists and syndicalists).",

What kinds of activism and engagements are there, that might not be talked about as much but still helps?\n\nI know people say ”get organized!” but, how? Where? What should i do there? Idk?\n___\n\nUnnecessary background about me that you don’t have to read (i’m just interested in the question above): \n\nI grew up in a fundamentalist christian organization (read: cult) where you weren’t allowed to vote or engage in politics at all and you had to always ”be neutral”. (Cause the world is just satan and god will fix it). And i left at about 18 years old, i’m 26 now. Ever since i started allowing myself get into politics i’ve known i’m left-wing, and over the years i’ve come to the conclusion thay i like a lot of the ideas in communism, and i’m anti-authoritarian (maybe not surprising because of my background). \n\nBut now i’m mentally ill because being in, and leaving, the cult was traumatizing. So i don’t have much energy for other things than fixing my psyche. And sometimes i don’t even want to know about the news because it exhausts me and makes me feel hopeless. But a part of me thinks that maybe engaging more in activism might give me some kind of energy and meaning that i want. \n\nAnd also, i still have something inside of me holding me back from engaging in politics and like.. being active and trying to make some kind of change. Apart from voting and learning theory basically. \n\nBut i do want to be more active. But also, i just don’t know how to. I’m not educated at uni so idk if i can really teach anyone anything. I do like writing and learning about things though. And i’m not the kind of person to scream in the street and i’m scared of nazis and things. \n\nHow do i gain the courage, motivation, energy and the right strategy to DO something?",

  "title": "A Question About Politicians",
  "selftext": "I'm an anthropology and history major in the US. I've been studying American history quite a lot recently, between personal reading and reading for school. History can be somewhat frustrating for me because of the vastly different ways it can be presented depending on what information you care to include. There's a stark difference between what you might find in a book authored by a known leftist author versus a textbook you might find in your average American college. \n\nOften times, I find that the actions various politicians took are presented in textbooks along these lines: X president believed in [insert principle], and came from [insert background], and so they supported/made [insert decision or whatever]. \n\nMy instinct is that this is a laughable way of approaching politics. My instinct is: they aren't just acting out what they personally believe, they are beholden to greater interests (perhaps those of capitalists in this case). I think that feeling of mine partially stems from our modern experience of politics, in which it is quite normal for us to hear about various forms of corruption, there are plenty of leaks that contradict things politicians have said, they are known to flip and flop on positions, there are obvious and verifiable lies, etc. And obviously there are things such as lobbying and the massive expenses of campaigns that make it sort of obvious that financial elites get great selection in their candidate. \n\nBut probably more important than that is an observation I've made that basically comes down to this: the decisions that get made at the end of the day always seem to, in some way, end up benefiting the groups with more power, even if it's in a counter intuitive or indirect manner. It seems to me that these things always happen when hierarchies are present. Thankfully, I feel like this can be talked about more candidly in the context of anthropology. Now... abstractly, this makes sense. Group has more power = decision making benefiting them more. But talking more concretely... I'm a little confused about how this really manifests in the real world (sometimes). \n\nThe anarchist principle of means needing to match ends is a related idea that I considered after reading Zoe Baker's book by that name. The idea that the activities we do and the way we interact with our environment shape us and therefore our means need to match our ends would explain that general observation I had. Organizing hierarchically would inevitably produce those outcomes I mentioned because the means (authority) shape the ends. But why exactly is this true? Is there a psychological or sociological explanation that any anarchists (or others) have put forward in regards to this? \n\nTo bring it back to the beginning: am I justified in believing that the history textbook approach (of seeing the acts of politicians as things they genuinely believed in) is laughable? I think how exactly the \"means and ends\" principle really works informs the answer to this question. \n\nIt's almost tempting for me to see running and achieving political office as corrupting you, almost as if by magic (perhaps not literally), but I read about all of these allegedly progressive politicians in history who claimed to have strong progressive beliefs and gotten progressive actions done. I also see fellow leftists praise people such as Bernie Sanders and AOC (who are liberal, but still progressive relative to other politicians in the US). Hell, the first person to call himself an anarchist, Proudhon, was in the French parliament. Anarchism as a real movement got it's strong anti electoral tenet later on it it's history. It doesn't seem to me Proudhon was magically corrupted. So, is it then possible that there genuinely are other well meaning but useless politicians out there in office? Can we even tell? And why wasn't Proudhon, or others potentially, corrupted? This is why I want to understand exactly how the means and ends principle manifests in the real world.",

  "title": "Difficulty understanding a section of Proudhon: Is there anything particular about Proudhon's definition or Meaning of \"being\" and \"Group,\" and in what ways does this relate to his anarchy or philosophy?",
  "selftext": "So for years now a particular phrase within Proudhon has sort of stuck with me, though I'd like some clarification of his meaning. It is, \"All that reason knows and affirms is that each being, like every idea, is a GROUP.” \n\nPart of me wonders what is lost from the translation of French into English, though this period of philosophy is just obsessed with these sort of definitional frames (but is modern philosophy any different?). Or is this more Whitman, \"am not contained between my hat and boots,\" the self is defined by a greater collectivity.\n\nIn its relation to Anarchy, I wonder if Proudhon's play between \"GROUP\" and the second section defining all as \"equal to NOTHING\" relates to Proudhon's usage of terms like property as being both theft and liberty, or anarchy being an antithesis and expression of freedom. He does this in What is Property, \"although I am very friendly to order, I am in the full force of the term, an anarchist. Listen to me.\" Seems he plays in contradiction?\n\n\n\n-------------------\n\nThe entire statement is from Philosophy of Progress and in context reads as, \"With the idea of movement or progress, all these systems, founded on the categories of substance, causality, subject, object, spirit, matter, etc., fall, or rather explain themselves away, never to reappear again. The notion of being can no longer be sought in an invisible something, whether spirit, body, atom, monad, or what-have-you. It ceases to be simplistic and become synthetic: it is no longer the conception, the fiction of an indivisible, unmodifiable, intransmutable (etc.) je ne sais quoi: intelligence, which first posits a synthesis, before attacking it by analysis, admits nothing of that sort a priori. It knows what substance and force are, in themselves; it does not take its elements for realities, since, by the law of the constitution of the mind, the reality disappears, while it seeks to resolve it into its elements. All that reason knows and affirms is that the being, as well as the idea, is a GROUP.\n\n\"Just as in logic the idea of movement or progress translates into that other, the series, so, in ontology, it has as a synonym the group. Everything that exists is grouped; everything that forms a group is one. Consequently, it is perceptible, and, consequently, it is. The more numerous and varied the elements and relations which combine in the formation of the group, the more centralizing power will be found there, and the more reality the being will obtain. Apart from the group there are only abstractions and phantoms. The living man is a group, like the plant or the crystal, but of a higher degree than those others; he is more living, more feeling, and more thinking to the degree that his organs, secondary groups, are in a more perfect agreement with one another, and form a more extensive combination. I no longer consider that self, what I call my soul,7 as a monad, governing, from the sublimity of its so-called spiritual nature, other monads, injuriously considered material: these school distinctions seem senseless to me. I do not occupy myself with that caput mortuum of beings, solid, liquid, gas or fluid, that the doctors pompously call SUBSTANCE; I do not even know, as much as I am inclined to suppose it, if there is some thing which responds to the word substance. Pure substance, reduced to its simplest expression, absolutely amorphous, and which one could quite happily call the pantogene, since all things come from it, if I cannot exactly say that it is nothing, appears to my reason as if it was not; it is equal to NOTHING. It is the mathematical point, which has no length, no size, no depth, and which nonetheless gives birth to all geometric figures. I consider in each being only its composition, its unity, its properties, its faculties, so that I restore all to a single reason,—variable, susceptible to infinite elevation,—the group.\"\n\n--------\n\nEdit: I think its relation to anarchy revolves around his inclusion of \"the more centralizing power will be found there....\"",

  "selftext": "Question as per the title of this post: Are we actually 'responsible' for anything in a heirarchal system\n\nThis comes out of a reply to something I posted yesterday. I often over think semantics and the meanings of words in particular contexts - and this one definitely got me thinking - so hopefully this is just healthy stress-testing of my own ideas and an opportunity for some new learnings.\n\nHere's my attempt at an explanation of the thought process behind the question...\n\nIn a heirarchal system or society - I think most people believe they have 'responsibilities'. I am responsible for getting a package delivered. You are responsible for keeping a project on budget. A professional chef is responsible for the meals they cook at the restaurant that employs them - all the way up to the highest levels of the state where a minister might be responsible for making as much money as they can off a war while trying to keep the civilian death toll out of the news.\n\nAt pretty much every level of any heirarchy - from me and my package all the way up to the minister and their war - that responsibility is mostly delegated to us by some other person or part of that hierarchy. My only connection to this package is the delegated responsibility to get it delivered - it's not my package, I don't know the recipient, my only part in this is the part that has been made mine by someone else.\n\nAnd if that is really my only connection to this package and there is probably a million other things I would rather be responsible for - like maybe doing something worthwhile with my life - then I also need to consider that I'm doing this under some form of duress.\n\nTaking that up another level - we also have to acknowledge that in these same heirarchal systems - that delegation almost always comes with an 'option' (for want of a better word) for some form of punishment. That could be getting my pay docked or missing out on a promotion or being fired or being put up against a wall and shot. So that 'option' for some form of 'punishment' is actually what we would call a threat.\n\nTherefore - I'm not delivering this hypothetical package because of some 'responsibility' - I'm doing it because of some 'threat'.\n\nSo unless I've already gone off track somewhere - what most of society considers something we might call 'responsibility' be it via delegation or job description or contractual obligation is actually something done under duress due to threat of punishment and if we accept that argument - that I'm not being delegated to, I'm being forced to - then can we actually call that 'responsibility'?\n\nI hope all that makes some sense.

I oscillate constantly between feeling terrified, and feeling strong. I really can't tell if this case is stupid and will all get dropped since I didn't even do anything illegal, or if the georgia rico statute is so broad that nothing can stop them from ruining my life. I know no one can answer these unknowns for me, but I’m trying to connect w/ folks who have had similar experiences and come out the other side to get some perspective. Or if anyone has any tips for dealing w/ the trauma of this situation or other state repression. Or thoughts on the situation. Please offer your help/insight if you can. Thank you.",

  "selftext": "In my local area in London there are many public book exchange boxes. Basically handmade wooden cabinets where local people donate and take books freely.\n\nI wondered why people don't do this for any other kind of media, like music?\n\nI'm a DIY musician / artist (I posted here many days ago about individualism which led to some great responses, thanks) and am really trying to escape the feeling of my work being commodified.\n\nWould something like a \"mutual aid\" box work for DIY music media like tapes and CDs? I.e., one made by artists who don't really care for the feeling of alienation that stems from distributing their music as sellable commodities, and who seek to befriend each other by gifting each other their art instead?\n\nIf I were to pursue this, fear that this could be problematic if I were to just leave the box anywhere. Most of the books that do get donated to the book boxes (which tend to stand by bus stops and local libraries) tend to be, quite frankly, not very good quality books. It's as if people assume good knowledge isn't worth the risk of being freely shared.\n\nThis leads me to think that if such a box for music was donated in a particularly musical place - like a local music venue - this would lead to a far greater number of people donating their own work, not just old charity shop bits n' bobs. Doubly so if it was labelled as a \"DIY music box\" with clear lettering on it. I know so many artists who struggle to feel connected in the music scene, and yet their focus is on public visibility, rather than specific, targeted, intentional connection.\n\nAnd yes, I am fully aware of the joys of the internet, but I'm not convinced relegating musical gift economies to digital file sharing platforms (Soulseek etc.) is sufficient. I feel it might be truly possible to decommodify physical music media - going by the principle that art is not for sale - so I'm not sure ideas of \"commodity fetishism\" apply here - the idea is hopefully to establish some kind of real social connection between DIY musicians here, mediated through contextually embedded objects, rather than treating the object as some kind of isolated end in itself.\n\nHas anyone ever done anything like this? Would this work, and are there any related topics / books / texts that might come in useful around the subject?",

They’ve got mitigations in place but they’re still giving the very Liberal approach of “masks *encouraged* but not required” meaning they’ll throw a box on a table to say they did something.

  "selftext": "I’m guessing this has been addressed in the past but I couldn’t find it on the previous posts on this sub. Bear in mind I come here as someone very sympathetic towards anarchy and really am asking in good faith.\n\nMy understanding of history is that we cannot have knowledge without hierarchical power structures. I’ll give a broad sketch of what I’m talking about. I’m not an historian so feel free to correct me on historical inaccuracies if present.\n\nWe know things because people learn them. And we know they learned them because they were written down. And since it is impossible for each individual to read everything and evaluate it all, we can distinguish what writings are reliable vs not by means of a canon. There are canons of historical research, of science, of literature. And without this canon a society loses its ability to accumulate knowledge over time into a vast body, since each person would be left to themselves. And anywhere we see a canon, we see a hierarchical structure which instantiates its validity. \n\nThe idea of a literary canon came about when Alexander the Great conquered much of the Mediterranean lands, and built the library of Alexandria. It was by his military power that such a broad region was unified, and able to acknowledge the importance of a carefully selected set of writings. This became a place of early scientific advances and philosophical debates.\n\nThe medieval world was in a state of unlearned savagery until the Holy Roman Empire built scriptoriums which developed a standardized and highly efficient method of printing. Through this means alone were the works of Aristotle and other philosophers translated and copied down. Furthermore, the church councils and inquisitions produced an effective means of enforcing what knowledge was authoritative in that time. Yes, we now know they were wrong about many things, but it is through the model they built that modern scientific communities are able to establish consensus. And it is through the enforcement of laws by the state that this knowledge is made binding on everyone.\n\nFor example, why do we rely on doctors? It is because they go to university: an inherently hierarchical institution in which the authority of the teacher is enforced onto the student; in which the student is taught strict guidelines and principles. And even once they are graduated, these guidelines are still enforced by the threat of revoking their license to practice. \n\nAll of this leads me to think that knowledge cannot be authoritatively passed down without hierarchy, without power concentrated into the hands of a few. Does anarchy force us to bite the bullet and lose any sense of the inheritance of a canon of texts with their accumulative wisdom?",

  "selftext": "Recently I've been reading some of Kropotkin's works, including the famous “Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution”, but what struck me was the undivided attention towards rather small, tightly-knit communities. Of course when it comes to examining age-old animal societies, both human and non-human alike, it would be exceedingly difficult to find anything that resembles the complexities of modern day statecraft. However, the fact that those communities were highly isolated, unitary groups that resembled something closer to a large multi generational family, rather than a country, still stands.\n\nWhen we look at how a usual, modern day family operates, it very closely matches what Kropotkin has described when writing about the tribes and villages of the past. From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs. This can sometimes even be extrapolated to a community of friendly neighbors that actively care and look after each other, although to a way lesser extent. The problem arises when the people we are extending this mutual aid to are nowhere near us. In that case this bond of familiarity is nowhere to be found, causing both diminished empathy and the need to provide aid in result. If we are looking to create a society based around many interconnected communes and cooperatives, then this lack of connection could possibly put a damper on it.\n\nAfter acknowledging the scale of described communities, even the most rabid social Darwinist works, such as “Might Is Right or The Survival of the Fittest” by an anonymous author under the pen name of Ragnar Redbeard, they too advocate for caring about those most close to us. Looking after people that we deem dear just really doesn't seem like an idea that leads to a conclusion that an entire country could function in such a fashion.",

  "selftext": "Obviously I know some are (I myself am) But I wonder why it is not more common. I recently saw a meme on a Facebook anarchist group that said \"things adults should not believe in\", it showed pictures of Santa Clause, a fairy, the Easter bunny, then a bunch of media outlet logos. I replied asking why god, the Bible, the Quran or any other religion/holy text was not shown, I know it was meant to be a joke but considering that the bible is more commonly believed by adults than Santa and is less reliable than MSNBC, it seemed this post was trying to not offend religious sensibilities while having no problem offending fans of MSNBC, and I wondered why... It seems to me religion has done just as much (if not more) harm as any media platform or state, and is less reliable/logical yet is criticized far less, And even in anarchist circles, Most anarchists will (rightfully) say anarcho-capitalists and anarcho-nationalists are not anarchists, but will accept christian anarchists... This is weird to me... A common anarchist slogan is (or at least was) NO GODS, NO KINGS, NO MASTERS, ancaps think capital is god capital is king, capital is master, so most anarchist oppose it, anarcho-nationalists think nation is god, nation is king, nation is master, so most anarchist oppose it and christian anarchists think Jesus is god, Jesus is king, Jesus is master, yet most anarchist accept it (or at least don't criticize it) Historically this was less the case, Mikhail Bakunin was so anti-theistic people call him anti-Semitic, the father of anarchism himself Pierre Joseph Proudhon said \"even if god does exist, he is a tyrant to be overthrown\" But today these quotes and principles have been forgotten and religion is given a pass by anarchists just like everyone else... criticism of the media and the state are far more common than criticism of religion inside and outside of anarchist circles even though as I stated above it seems obvious that religion is less reliable/logical and has done at least just as much (if not more harm) So I have to wonder, why are anarchists not anti-theists???",

  "selftext": "It sucks that r/Anarchism has disabled requests but I totally get it. 😩\n\nI would like to preface this by saying I have anarchist roots as a teen but found myself drifting away from anarchism over time as I grew older. \n\nSo here's what I wanted to discuss. Upon the dissolution of the state, you immediately run into a few problems:\r  \n\r  \n1. A lot of people don't care about the fate of minorities in their respective societies\r\r\n\n2. A disturbing number of people already blame people with deviating characteristics / worldviews for causing the exacerbated suffering resulting from capitalism's contradictions due to many decades of deeply ingrained propaganda - the politically correct, the academically-guided, and voices of reason and compassion would be unable to guide the development of society a large except for small pockets maybe, especially since most are pacifistic liberals used to compromise and collaboration with undesirable regimes\r  \n\r  \n3. A lot of people will be reluctant to participate in building completely unfamiliar alternative structures in governing society\r  \n\r  \n4. Because of community and family ties, the majority of people will likely align themselves under the guidance of \"warlords\" who already commanded a degree of authority from the previous social order\r  \n\r  \n5. Most people will probably move toward recreating social institutions that propagate the ideas they are familiar with:  \nprivate property  \ngenerational wealth  \nexclusive relationships to the means of production (thus leading to continued class distinction)  \noften religiously motivated social rules that subjugate women / control reproduction / repress bodily autonomy  \nsystematic oppression along ethnic / cultural / nationalistic lines by the majority or hegemonic group\r  \n\r  \n6. People who were victimized prior will be motivated to normalize punitive / vigilante justice\r  \n\r  \nThese obvious predictable outcomes have got me thinking of a few questions, and here are the conclusions I've come to:\r\n\n1.\r\n\nQ: Who's going to protect ethnic / gender / sexual minorities?\r  \n\r  \nA: You need a group upholding and enforcing values of inclusivity in a position of coercive power to protect them. Their values would need to be adopted by mainstream society in a short window of time... a process which cannot be free from coercion.\r  \n\r  \n2.\r  \n\r  \nQ: How do you ensure that the collapse of the state will not simply result in the purging of political radicals, such as - crucially - Anarchists?\n\nA: You need strong, enforced political cohesion to run a counter-propaganda project that will turn the first generation or two away from their previous programming under capitalism. But that's not enough because you want lasting protection from these groups not only for a short time!\r  \n\r  \nTherefore I think society should start seeing minorities, academics of the social sciences (oft targeted as \"naysayers\" and \"saboteurs\" under capitalism), and conscientious people who have a tendency to proselytize political correctness - with a degree of reverence, that they are the heart of a conscious society and their counsel should be considered in a lot of matters, that blaming them or not listening to them is something that leads to the reduction of quality in life in a society. I know this sounds borderline religious but I think it is necessary, and is one of the big points I have butted heads with Anarchists about.\r  \n\r  \n3, 4 & 5.\r  \n\r  \nQ: A few scattered tiny communes built on horizontal organization scavenging to survive and trying to keep on the down low to avoid rump government forces and agrarian warlords / oligarchic militias, will not have the flow of resources needed to bring the change necessary to improve the conditions of society. What preconditions would need this to not be the case after the capitalist state's removal?\r  \n\r  \nA: Ties into both 1 & 2. This is where I tend toward characteristics of a vanguardist approach toward exiting capitalism. You need to fully take control of the instrument of the state and make use of all of its appendages toward making rapid development in a short period of time, if only to the extent that is possible in the face of encroaching climate devastation. This may require the use of statist-aligned rhetoric and the illusion of political continuity, with a thoroughly anti-capitalist framework behind it. You will seize capital and make it managed for all society, but the populace - who are not yet ready for such an organizational change - will superficially see that it had to go through due legal process. See that enough people's lives may be saved through this and it generates widespread enough legitimacy among the populace for the ideology/ies of improving the human condition. At the same time, you have grassroots organizations spreading and normalizing the idea and practice of horizontal organization, where individuals don't auction their interests against one another but stand up to represent many who are in need.\r  \n\r  \nOne of my only major disagreements with Marxists - particularly those in the Leninist line - is their fetish for a national platform and geopolitical garbage.\r  \n\r  \n6.\r  \n\r  \nQ: Do you need to prevent the flare-up of vigilante/punitive justice in the event of a revolution?\r  \n\r  \nA: I think yes. The mental image that will be left behind by a revolution will shape its lasting legitimacy in the eyes of mainstream society. This is why I think the social order that steps in to fill the vacuum capitalism leaves behind needs to immediately implement methods of rehabilitative justice... this however technically means seizing the monopoly on violence to disarm and deter revenge militias who want to just execute individuals and groups.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, I think rehabilitative justice will be important in a hypothetical future of an improved human condition. There will always be people who have compulsions that can't be controlled. I think society will need the resources to build architecture, infrastructure and the administration to keep them in a place where they will be safe from themselves / others will be safe from them, where some of them may be able to safely put compulsions into practice in a virtual environment, while they are also taken care of... until such a time, if ever, that they can be fully rehabilitated and reformed. This is more desirable than punishment-based conditioning or - as a Trotskyist once suggested - exiling them into the jungle and shooting them if they try to come back 😨 (smh 😔).\r  \n\r  \nThoughts? I'm overall curious to what degree anarchists want *the entire human condition to change for all human beings*. Any degree at all or is it enough to stop living under capitalism?",

As long as there’s “no kings”. \n\nPositive freedoms only exist under certain social conditions, and to be guaranteed equitably, effectively must be *enforced* by collective action.  The positive freedom to access healthcare doesn’t exist to you if you’re Stone Age man, or to underserved desert communities, unable to attract healthcare talent because the abundance of resources elsewhere is more enticing. \n\nTaking negative freedom to the extreme, a society of individuals that held the ideal ‘no rulers’ would have to handicap their ability to control others in order to minimize the ability for others to control them. This ideal taken to the extreme means allowing people to pollute the air, and dump chemicals in rivers, as these are negative freedoms that only a ‘ruler’ could take away. \n\nFocus on negative freedom also seems to lead to freedom inequality. The Superman (edit not Übermensch) gets to have every freedom possible (except the one self-imposed inability to use the freedom to rule), while the people who are children, elderly, deficient, or disabled are left with very few freedoms to actualize. \n\nTaking positive freedom to the extreme, a society of individuals that held the ideal ‘all rulers’ would have to submit to the control of others in order to maximize their ability to control others. If all supreme authorities are created equal, then all members of society would have an equal say in the construction of reality. This ideal taken to the extreme means a direct democratic consensus of the council of kings to determine what underwear you will put on in the morning. \n\nI think ‘every man a king’ is at least an interesting concept, and reflects the human desire to have external reality reflect our internal experience. A society that is able to differentiate between the personal and social could give supreme authority to each king over their own personal matters, and equal authority to each king over social matters (thus protecting most negative freedoms and ensuring most positive freedoms are equitable). By adding in the ideal of localism, each issue can be addressed by the smallest most relevant council of kings.\n\nPanarchy is the opposite of what anarchists want, but could submitting to the legitimate social authority of the collective guarantee liberty, equality, and justice in a civil society? Would blending anarchism with ideas from panarchism lead to any better outcomes regarding equitability and positive freedoms?",

  "selftext": "As a queer person who has also been struggling with their gender and the trans community, I'd like to know the opinions of other anarchists. As I see it, gender is a tool of oppression created to uphold the patriarchy and, as such, should be abolished. However, this opinion is quite unpopular in the trans community. It seems to me like the whole idea of that community is based on the existence on some nebulous, innate \"gender\" which is, in sort, akeen to a soul. The (liberal?) trans community seems to want this \"gender\" to exist and they seem to believe that it, inevitably, decides a lot about a person despite at the same time wanting freedom of gender expression. However, this idea is only useful to protect binary trans people at the expense of women, which includes trans women and the unique ways in which they are oppressed by the patriarchy. Meaning that, really, it does not help trans people at all.\n\nDo you agree with this or do you find holes in the argument? Do you believe in gender abolition or some kind of reconstruction of gender to make it non-hierarchical? Or something else? I also know a lot of these talking points are used by TERFS, however, TERFS always seem to forget about the anarchical basis for this idea and flip into authoritarianism to oppress trans people.",

  "selftext": "It seems that many anarchist artists and musicians emphasise things like collective improv jams and group art projects as \"more anarchistic\" than individual art projects made by singular people.\n\nI understand why this might be - individualist anarchism is seen as relatively untrustworthy compared to social anarchism due to the former's closer kinship with liberalism, and the latter's effectiveness at consensus organising, etc.\n\nHowever, speaking as a music artist and recent anarchist, I feel no joy at the idea of renouncing my individual expression, giving up on my solitude or my ability to record and \"release\" music on tape or CD, and just giving over to collective improv jamming with others all the time.\n\nAt risk of coming across as egotistical, I feel that I have better ideas than many other artists, and I don't find the experience of big-group live musical synthesis at all that fulfilling. In fact, most of the jams I've seen organized in the name of collectivity have been rather dull in my book. Not to say I don't like collaborating, but it usually feels limiting for me when people like to jackhammer ideas of \"the collective\" going into it. \n\nAlso, I like the feeling of being recognised individually for the work I've created, and I'm not sure this is entirely a false desire implanted by neoliberalism, capitalism and/or commodity fetishism etc. etc.\n\nFrom what I see, in the music world, anarchists are mostly concerned with hardcore punk and collective music-making. Beyond that, I know few or no answers to the question of how anarchists artists might - for example - still go about disseminating recorded music of individual musicians, and have those artists still feel recognised for it, without turning that record into a commodity, and without having that artist feel guilty for taking the limelight away from other artists etc. \n\nAre there any readings out there that could help people like me come to terms with their desire for individual recognition and appreciation of the art they've made by others, without having to succumb to the guilt-tripping of puritanically anarcho-communist ideas?\n\nAlso, am I misunderstanding something? Don't get me wrong - I do mostly believe in anarcho-communist organizing for art practices - I have a dream of setting up a free social centre / network for experimental and outsider musicians, with no questions asked as to their \"outsider\" status - but I'm really opposed to my personal creative vision getting diluted because \"no hierarchy\" or whatever, just as I am opposed to it getting diluted because hierarchy.",

  "selftext": "The title of the thread is my one big question.\n\nI'm afraid this will be hugely insulting to anyone who identifies as Marxist. If you are one such person, please don't bother responding as I came here to avoid positive bias and you'll just be putting yourself in a position to get angry for no reason. It's also just a tiresome rant, so you wouldn't glean anything positive out of it anyway.\n\nAnecdotally, I've personally seen Marxists online to be significantly more likely than anarchists to suggest that socialism (if we understand socialism as an umbrella term for both anarchism, Marxism, and anything in between) is \"the far left.\" They imply or outright state that socialism is farther to the left than liberalism and even propagate the idea that fascism is \"the far right\" and they thus couldn't possibly be fascist. This certainly sounds correct at first and second glance, but it seems to me that this is an oversimplification that directly benefits the Marxist branch of socialism specifically. Liberals seem to agree with all of this as well, which benefits liberals, specifically. \n\nThe way I see it, socialism isn't \"to the left\" of liberalism - It's an entirely distinct and separate economic model from capitalism with it's own left and right wing. Anarchism is the far left of the broader \"libertarian\" left wing of socialism and Marxism is the \"authoritarian\" right wing (with, perhaps, MLs representing the far right). When rarely some MLs have historically been so \"authoritarian\" (right wing) as to become totalitarian - supporting oppressive censorship, intense nationalism, and prohibiting expressions of identity (such as religion), then this \"alt-right of socialism\" would appropriately be called fascist.\n\nLiberals benefit from calling socialism \"the far left\" so that they can bill themselves as \"the reasonable left,\" which keeps people invested in the capitalist system. It's also then in the best interest of Marxists to call socialism \"the far left\" because it allows them to disassociate themselves from the stigma of \"authoritarianism\" and the historical examples of redfash nations. Marxists and liberals feed off of this symbiotic psy-op and together have been the root cause of nearly all of the misconceptions about socialism and why it can be so hard to find straight answers when you're first breaking into socialism.\n\nAdditionally, it seems to me that Marxists and liberals have another shared interest in giving as much power as possible to the state, so much so that I sometimes have trouble distinguishing an ML from an ultraliberal until they say \"planned economy\" (which I've found to be a dogwhistle for supporting the forced installation of a vanguard as the one party to rule the now all-powerful state).",

To be clear, on a rational level that makes total sense to me; however, this creates a practical problem, because if I don't refer to myself as an anarchist and actively seek out anarchist spaces, then basically all other online leftist spaces are dominated by MLs, who I hate. So do any of you have advice for where I can find a decent forum for discourse?

Guns and other weapons will be necessary to remove armed power imbalances and maintain anarchy. So, I believe most places will still have to have a weapon arsenal.\n\nHowever, in order to avoid power imbalances an universal access to it must be granted.\n\nHowever, I feel like access still can't be unrestricted, even in anarchist society, weapon abuse can't be completely cut out.\n\nHow would the restrictions be performed without creating a power imbalance? Would it be something like jury duty where members of society regularly and randomly rotate in and out of restriction oversight?\n\nEven it that case, what about the temporary power imbalance that exists during \"jury duty\"? A group could coordinate and wait until most of them have \"jury duty\" on the same day and then occupy the weapon arsenal. \n\nI guess, the solution to that would be to have multiple arsenals distributed throughout an area and reducing the probability of such an event. I guess that answers that question, but feel free to share your thoughts on this anyway.\n\nWhat about storing weapons at home? I know that in praxis, it can't be really avoided and the only reason currently why most people don't store weapons at home is because they choose not to, but I do worry about the psychological effect this has on people. Currently we have the illusion of safety, due to police. But with no police (to be clear, I am all for that), what would be necessary to maintain trust within communities where individuals may carry guns or have them at home? I know that I would be somewhat paranoid and even currently, I always tense up when I see police or someone who carries a gun.\n\nI might be worrying too much about nothing, but I can't help to think that this could be an issue for others as well and could be a serious problem in maintaining anarchy in the long run.",

  "selftext": "Most of the time when someone writes in with the top most obvious economic questions (how will you ensure everyone does their share of work, how will you prevent exploitation, what if states form again, etc?) the answers mostly rely on the general assumption that everyone involved will be anarchist. Its been said repeatedly that people living in anarchist societies will have a different view of community and giving than people who grew up under hierarchal oppression. This pretty much assumes that your population consists in significant majority of either people who grew up in anarchist communities, or who did the reading and came into this with the specific intention of being anarchist-- this will not work if you just take a bunch of people who grew up in oppression and dump them into an area with no government.\n\nSo, with refugees,\n\n* There are currently a lot of people in very desperate situations who would like to move to basically anywhere other than where they currently are. They will move, not a few at a time, but in mass, to any safe area that will accept them. This will not stop if we end capitalism tomorrow-- climate change alone will keep this going for the rest of our lives\n*  They will come, not because they want to be anarchist, but because they want to be safe (a laudable goal!)\n* the vast majority of these people are not anarchist and in fact many are from very conservative/hierarchal cultures and/or religions (islam most obviously, but not exclusive to that).\n* Its easy to say people will adopt anarchist ideas if its a few at a time, but it doesn't happen instantly, and even less likely if the newcomers make up >20% of the population and share a language/religion\n\n- One answer I've seen here is that anarchism should be built gradually, starting with community projects, mutual aid, unions, co-ops etc. That's a good idea, but I presume that at some point, there will be a plan for anarchist areas to exist outside of government control. And of course, one assumes these areas will have open borders, also laudable, so they will welcome all refugees\n\n-----\n\n*My motivation for posting this is not a gotcha but a sincere interest in hearing ideas for how to handle it. I lived in germany for most of the 2010s and say first-hand the strife caused by mass movement of immigrants-- I and everyone in my family were very in support of helping immigrants and still are. We volunteered moving people and helping get food and resources to new immigrants. I do in fact still favor open borders-- but i think its *difficult* in ways that I think people who haven't experienced it underestimate. \n\nLeaving aside xenophobia, assuming everyone sincerely wants to help, settling large amounts of people is tricky. Many/most of them didn't know how to work our systems (bus routes, atms are different apparently, getting a cell phone plan, how to make a doctor appointment-- theres so much stuff)*, not speaking the same language, very often sick and traumatized upon arrival, etc. I do believe this would be *easier* without so much government red tape-- i don't think it would be *easy.* And if you're talking about fully open borders that's probably 10x more people per capita than we were taking in, in a probably newer, less stable community than the entire country of germany.",

Organised militaries are always a more effective combat force than a disorganised community, so, how would the community respond effectively?\n\n4. How would crime be prosecuted?\nConsidering that no police exists, how is crime dealt with? If it’s just going to be mob rule, it will lead to events like the Waco lynching. What if the accused is innocent, but the people thought otherwise?\n\n5.

  "selftext": "I was recently asked, as a new and still learning anarchist, what my opinion of sovereign citizens was and if I believe they have any legitimate points. Id like to hear your takes! Here's mine (I apologize if I don't quote proudhoun of bakunin or anyone else when I could, im still reading. This is purely my personal belief)\n\nEDIT: I've made some deeply flawed assumptions and projections, however I will keep it as is. I have revised my believe that they are not anarchists, and I've made the grave mistake that \"against this form of government\" does not mean against government as a whole. I apologize but this was educational for me, and I thank you all for that!\n\nI think sovereign citizens are legitimate anarchists who have taken a detour through crazy town and lost all legitimacy. If you say \"you cannot enforce your rules upon me based on a \"constitution\". It is simply a coerced contract that I was never given a chance to opt out of. If you subscribe to a social contract theory that the only allowable actions you may take upon another are those that are explicitly laid out in mutually agreed upon contracts, then inherently your constitution, given my non consent, is not binding.\"\n\nI think this is a perfectly valid point! But let's take a detour through an analogy to scientology. If you say \"this is about identifying things that are causing you harm. There are things both within and without you that cause you harm and misery, and identifing and removing those things will let you reach your full potential and self actualize!\" Id say fuck yea, sign me up! And then, it goes down hill. You say \" Cool, good choice, buy our books and our courses and follow all of our rules and abuses. Time for learning, chapter 84: those things are called thetans and they are aliens! See long ago, lord xenu...\" And I'd say what the FUCK are you talking about!?! And the legitimacy is gone.\n\nSo instead of questioning the legitimacy of the state, and whether any form of government can be ethical, they instead rely on weird, backwards bible like parables as if trying to explain it to children while not fulling understanding it yourself. \"You see, when you are born, the government starts a file. They print a birth certificate and a bank account and trade people as currency\" and again I go \"what the fuck are you talking about?!\" And the legitimacy is once again gone. \n\nBut this cannot be an indictment of anarchy as a whole. If you believe that the journey is as important as the destination, then simply having the same end goal to not be governed is not enough if you're journey is through a web of insanity, but it should not cast the same skepticism onto the goal.\n\nWhat are your guys thoughts?",

There's no grey area between support for hierarchy and opposition to hierarchy. Anarchism is all or nothing. \n\nAnother way of looking at it is just *anarchist vs. world*.

  "selftext": "Hi! I am a Marxist, but I would like to know more about the differences between anarchism and Marxism and about their similarities.\n\nSo that we can speak more concretely, I attach here my political convictions: In an ideal case, after the revolution, the state must be preserved for a certain period, as an instrument for the exercise of political violence against the exploiting classes.  This state should be run through the soviets.  There would be soviets of different levels: local, regional, etc.  Anyone should be able to represent his interests even in higher level soviets, even when he does not have a majority in the local soviet (as it was in the Soviet Union).  All the decisions that can be solved at a lower level, must be solved there (decisions are made only by the people that are influenced by that decision).  The supreme bodies in the state are the Soviets.  They create those \"executive committees\" (\"governments\") that implement the decisions of the soviets (in the way that all soviets decide).  Regarding that \"avant-garde party\", I am of the Marxist opinion that it has special importance.  However, I believe that, in a Soviet republic, he should not participate directly in the management of the state, but should continue to work with the people from below, just as he did until the revolution.  They must focus on the development of theory, the propagation of ideas in society, the organization of the masses, etc.  Already through those masses, who participate in the soviets, the party ends up \"leading\" the state.  People can always choose other leaders if they want.  In this context, the party truly remains part of the masses and does not separate itself from them forming that \"political elite\".\n\nSome anarchists, as far as I know, understand the need to keep a \"small state\", reduced to the minimum and for as short a period as possible.  Likewise, regarding the idea of a \"vanguard party\", I suppose most anarchists reject this concept more in the sense of \"a few people directly running the country\" and not in the above sense.  In this context, I would like to know if I am right and if the differences between Marxism (a rather libertarian variant of Marxism) and anarchism are really that big, in your opinion?\n\nBesides this question, I would also be interested in other differences between them.  Likewise, I am open to other ideas, recommendations of books/articles/etc on the topic.\n\n(I apologize for my poor English. I hope it's not such a big problem to understand what I wrote).",

I think if a bunch of these experiments happen near each other then they could maybe pressure the government non-violently to de facto become a part of federation, they would become de facto autonomous regions of a state. where these local units of government would organize themself in a left-libertarian fashion, while agitating even more towards anarchism.

  "selftext": "If I look up definitions for the word \"society\", I find a few. \n\nWikipedia calls it\n\n>A society is a group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same spatial or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. \n\n[encyclopedia.com](https://encyclopedia.com) defines it as\n\n> A union of individuals, particularly of human beings, among whom a specific type of order or organization exists, although not all are agreed on its formal constitutive. \n\nand the encyclopedia britannica defines it as\n\n> people in general thought of as living together in organized communities with shared laws, traditions, and values \n\nSo general consensus of what a society is seems to include laws, values and expectations.\n\nI am asking, because communism means \"classless society\". I am all for classlessness, I think we all as anarchists agree that class division sucks. But I don't get why there are so few anarchists that are against the concept of society as a whole. These laws, traditions and values are setting up power structures that favor a group over another, after all (which to me sounds an awful lot like a hierarchy).\n\nSo the question that I have is: What does \"society\" mean to you, if it does not mean establishing a hierarchy?\n\n(Regarding me, this has been important in the past: I am already an anarchist. I am asking, because this is a position that isn't widely spread and I am asking myself why)",

  "selftext": "Let me explain, I understand that anarchists criticize and fight against certain ideologies. What I struggle to understand is why some anarchist end up trying to IMPOSE their own beliefs. Isn't that the opposite of what we believe in? \n\nI have witnessed it many times. Perhaps in an informal conversation with friends, colleagues, classmates, strangers online, whatever. Someone who isn't really into politics makes a comment and some anarchist decides to attack them verbally by saying they are authoritarian, or close minded, for example. I think that, since the person speaking isn't well informed, the right thing to do is educating them, not attacking them. In an informal conversation, you usually are talking to an average person, not to the CEO of an international company that exploits kids. So why get aggressive? \n\nThis aggressiveness ends up making everyone else our enemy. Gives us a terrible reputation. And if the goal is recluting people, making them fear you isn't the way to go. Weren't we fighting agaisnt that?\n\n AGAIN, I'm talking about aggressiveness against uninformed people, civilians, the average person with a 9 to 5 job.

  "title": "Thoughts on cryptocurrencies, their implications, and how they interact with anarchy.",
  "selftext": "So, A little about me. I am a market anarchist. This means that I believe that all people should be able to use any medium of exchange they choose to arrange their trades, and that people do get a benefit from specializing and trading goods and services. \n\nI am not a capitalist. Lets be clear what capitalism is, and I am going to use Marx's take on capitalism. Capitalism is the buying and selling of another human's work. Therefore, if I buy your gears and put them into my clocks? That's not capitalist. If a collective I am part of makes gears, and springs, and sells those to a collective I am a part of, and our collective then makes those into watches? Not capitalist. \n\nHowever, if you hire a person, NOW we are getting a little capitalist. We have bought the labor, but we haven't sold it. Not yet. However the moment you issue stocks, then you are a full blown capitalist. Because at that point, people who are not involved in the business whatsoever buy those stocks, and all of a sudden you have a person expending capital (money) to obtain more capital at the expense of the worker. This is the fundamental essence of capitalism. This is why communism exists. This the fundamental theft of value. \n\nNow lets talk about fiat, and corporations, and INFLATION. Inflation benefits the capitalist at the expense of the worker, by lowering their wages. Here is how it works. Inflation decreases the real purchasing power of money by a set amount every year. However, the company keeps paying the same starting wage. They give out raises every year to be sure, but as the older workers age out, younger workers who worked the same amount of time as the older workers end up making the same as the older workers did, except they are existing later in time, farther along the inflation curve. This is how you can get workers at walmart making the same amount as those who worked there a few years back. Everyone is getting raises, but the wages and the starting salaries are not inflation adjusted. \n\nNow, lets talk about how cryptocurrencies affect this ugly mess. \n\nFirst off, bitcoin. Lets put aside for a moment that bitcoin is grossly environmentally unfriendly (because it is) Bitcoin tackles the inflation problem head on, but it also invites speculation. Now, speculation is not wrong or right. It simply is. Like gambling. If you started to gamble your money on dice against a group of your friends, that is not for or against anarchism. its simply gambling. But we also have people who call it an investment that will pay off. In 2020 and 2016 they were proved right. Will they be proved right again? Nobody knows. Therefore its not anarchy or capitalism. Its a bunch of people throwing money into a pit and hoping number go up. \n\nNow this equation changes somewhat when you take into account capitalists and the theft of value they have performed over the last century. If a poor person buys bitcoin, then a rich person buys bitcoin who stole that money from the poor person with capitalism, then the poor person sells and is able to buy a house using the value that the rich person used to acquire the bitcoin, this is somewhat an evening of the books. For many early bitcoin holders who started out as wage slaves who are the children of wage slaves, this evened out their fortunes and had a great effect in returning their stolen value. \n\nThis equation changes more when you hear about central banks trying to issue capital controls. Many crypto types call them cbdcs, but lets call them what they are. Food stamp rules for everybody, regardless if you are on food stamps or not. The bitcoin allows for person to person exchange of value, which fosters economies without the control of the banks. This is very anarchist. \n\nNow, if you take a step back from bitcoin, there's an entire world of other cryptocurrencies out there. Before anything else, I would like to point out that most cryptocurrencies that do staking are capitalist. Most cryptocurrencies that do proof of work are not capitalist. The reason is that staking cryptocurrencies require people to put up some amount of capital, to buy cryptos, which obtains more cryptos which gets turned into capital. That's capitalism!\n\nThere are a few exceptions, and the most notable exception to the model is avax, and the only reason its an exception in this regard is that they open sourced their code, and allow anyone to use their code to launch a new chain. However, hooking it up to the main avax chain does require a validator that is earning fees and that is capitalist. I personally am considering launching a validator that will have 0 fee grabs, just to force the validator operators to slash fees, but that is a different story. \n\nOf the mineable tokens, the most important aside from bitcoin is monero. Monero acts as both the most used crypto for illicit transactions, and the most anti-authoritarian crypto in existence. All other cryptos can be traced, but monero allows people to move without being traced. As you can imagine, its a great tool for buying drugs and worse on the darknet. \n\nHowever, how does this cycle back to anarchy? Well, part of what props up the hierarchical systems is taxes. Now are taxes good? Yes, if they are taken with the consent of the governed. However when they are taken without the consent of the governed an are used to fund police forces, and given away in handouts to people who personally know and lobby politicians? Well, that is what is called the beginnings of a totalitarian state. Add a dash of racism, a healthy dollop of religion, a populist deer leader, and you have a potent mix that calls for riots. But how does this work with cryptocurrency? Well, lets look back at bitcoin and all the other cryptos that can be analyzed with chainalysis. They facilitate taxation and scrutiny. In comparison, cryptos like monero destroy it. This actually is good for anarchy because it moves the power of deciding if people should pay taxes to the government directly to the shopkeepers. If you own a shop and you take payments in bitcoin your making it very easy for the government (or anyone else for that matter) to track your customer's wallets. If you accept monero, you make it very easy for them to evade taxation. In other words, it moves power to the edges of society. And this is ultimately a good thing in the cause towards anarchism, and leftist statehood. Remember, capitalists like the decision making power around taxes focused in a few people. That way, they can pay a few bribes and get their way. When a system has power moved to the edges like this, bribes only go so far. \n\nIn closing, is crypto good or bad for anarchy? I think the right answer is to say neither. It's complex. Cryptocurrencies like ethereum are without a doubt capitalistic, (the original dao was a digital vc firm for goodness sake) however the entire space is a mixed bag. Some are most definitely commodities, not securities, and you wouldn't argue a piece of metal is anarchist or not anarchist. Likewise, they cannot be argued to be so. None of this absolves the actions of scammers who have been operating on the various chains. That's not capitalism though, its just criminality. ",

People who make rules shouldn’t be the people who judge according the rules and both parties shouldn’t be the people who enforce the rules. \n\nI understand that this is mostly needed within a big state society, where power concentrates only at view people, who then are regulated by each other (according to this idea and obviously theoretically speaking) \n\nIn my understanding anarchism does not abandon power or rules. But redistributes power and rulemaking to a feasible small amount of people. But how do you ensure that some kind of separation of powers is then maintained in this small group so that no lynch mob or gang leader will rule (in the worst case)?",

Gender norms, expectations, roles and the refusal of anything outside of today's patriarchal heteronormative binary system would presumably all disappear with the disappearance of gender itself, therefore eliminating an enormous part of the queer struggle.\n\nGender and sex, obviously being two different words and concepts. People are born in different sexes, which might itself impact their thinking, but we can't really ever know, until the factor of gender is out of the picture. Cis people say, for example, cis men and cis women think differently, and its true, but not because their genitals aren't the same shape, it is because of their role in society enforced by gender. People are taught and forced to think differently based on their assigned gender at birth, creating said norms, expectation and roles. I can't imagine what an intersex person has to go through.\n\nI am aware that people often take refuge in gender or they might find comfort in presenting a certain way, which is absolutely fine. The problem lies in the forced participation pushed onto everyone, even people who physically or mentally, can't or don't want to fit in.\n\nCapitalism uses gender and the peoples struggle with it for profit and control. To me, it seems inevitable, that the gender system with patriarchy tied to it, similarly to capitalism, will collapse.

It is practically responsible for nearly every single failed revolution in the last few centuries, both violent and non-violent, and has no signs of stopping soon. \n\nThis is far from the only state that commits violence on a constant basis. In fact, that's all of them. Yet, somehow, many Anarchists act like non-violent protest will *somehow* still grant us freedom from this cruelty?\n\nWhy? How? Liberals tried non-violence for CENTURIES and it never worked. Kent State? Martin Luther King Jr? Even in Canada, a prime minister STRANGLED an protestor in public and not only didn't apologize, but *joked* about it, too.\n\nWhat makes you think the state will ever stop being the state? (Read: fucking violent) States didn't stop then, aren't stopping now, and yet, apparently, doing nothing but holding up signs is gonna EVENTUALLY make them stop, some day. Some year. Some century.\n\nYes, I know, \"violent revolutions haven't been successful for us historically,\" if that was the case, I encourage you to explain the Zapatistas. Or the fact that the Spanish Civil War was very, very nearly successful, and largely lost as an result of the Communist's cowardly betrayals. Not to mention that violent revolution **has worked for many non-Anarchist revolutions.**\n\nThe problem is that Anarchism has just been outnumbered by many easier to grasp, but ultimately foolish ideologies, not the difficulty of overthrowing an violently militant state system.\n\nBelieve me, I **don't** want violent revolution to be our way out of over 6 million years of suffering. And I don't believe non-violent protest is completely useless. But it becomes more and more likely with time (especially with how many reactionary governments pop up due to it in the first place) that violent revolution is more likely to end the State's reign over humanity than not. \n\nOtherwise, I fail to see how sit ins and praxis alone is going to make congress decide to formally abolish itself after 200+ years of atrocities.

I have noticed that the general consensus in leftist or anarchist circles is that science is objectively factual and should not be questioned. I would agree that properly designed, properly conducted, independent study is indeed objectively factual. But how do we really know what is independent study in the context of capitalism and government? Capitalist forces could of course bribe scientists to do their bidding. Government forces could censor, threaten, or even murder scientists who go digging where they aren't supposed to. It's pretty easy to determine what type of science could be influenced by capitalism, just follow the money. I doubt there is a whole bunch of independent scientific study on topics that multi-billion dollar industries could benefit from. These industries have the money to make scientists do whatever they want, or even kill scientists who won't do what they want. It's well known that the CIA has carried out assassinations in foreign countries at the behest of giant corporations. Do we not think they would do that in our own country? Of course they would, we just wouldn't hear about it on the news. Even if a topic doesn't have money behind it, who knows what the government does or doesn't want us to see. If they didn't want us to see some science, I don't think we would end up seeing it. We probably only get to see what they want us to see.

This explains why humans have been so terribly evil through out history towards each other and makes me think that horrible things like wars and genocides are actually human nature and natural for our species, like how it's natural for lions to fight other lions. According to Steven Pinker (yes, he's a capitalist propagandist, but his research into violence seems to be widely respected as sound in the anthropology field) human's were in a constant state of war for most of human existance and the average rates of violence were higher than the peak rates of WW2. Human nature is essentially cooperative within our group but murderous and sociopathic towards anyone outside the group.\n\nI also think that how much people value other people is based on their social status - not status in a capitalist sense but an evolutionary one, that has always existed since the hunter-gatherer days, i.e. your competence in life, your \"genetic fitness\" (intelligence, fitness, health, beauty, etc) all come togheter to make someone more likeable/loveable, or less so. AFAIK many hunter-gatherer tribes would exile or kill the elderly, disabled or otherwise low status individuals because they were seen as a burden on the group. In the Ache tribe the fathers would even kill their own male children if they thought they looked too physically weak, as having thick muscles was an important social status symbol for men, and these sons lowered the fathers social status.\n\nI'm sure many will disagree with me, but this seems to be what the evidence suggests.\n\nChomsky was once asked if he believes in humanity, and he said that if you don't believe in human beings you might aswell just kill yourself, because wouldn't be a point to doing anything.\n\nIf that's how important this question is (to people who give a shit about improving life for people), how can you possibly be honest with yourself about the answer?",

But regarding capitalism, I was curious about how that would work in an anarchial relationship. I understand that things like monopolies and massive corporations create a sort of hierarchy where the rich get richer and it makes it damn near impossible for competition to arise. But what I was curious about is how those things would be \"abolished\" in an unregulated society. Wouldn't an anarchial relationship give massive corporations *more* power rather than less? And if that's true, how does an unregulated economy deal with the issue of unequal distribution of wealth?\n\nI admit my economic knowledge is very limited, but I'm also curious as to how a capitalist-free society even function in practical terms (Anarchial or otherwise). I'm also confused as to the fundamental opposition to capitalism in most of these circles. Monopolies aside, isn't capitalism at its core simply a trade between two parties for equal benefit? \"I give you an apple and you give me an orange...\" Again, maybe I just have a very basic understanding of economics, but I've always thought of currency as a sort of \"middle-man\" that allows people to trade without having to provide resources they don't have. If I'm correct, then on a broad scale what's the issue with capitalism from an anarchist perspective? Isn't this just another way of expressing voluntary cooperation between individuals?\n\nIf any of this comes off as provocative, that is not my intention. I'm purely asking out of ignorance.

  "title": "Regarding postmodernism and \"post structuralist anarchism\"",
  "selftext": "Long text ahead, but if you are interested, please read and comment.\n\nI am still learning about \"classic anarchism\", but I always have on the back of my mind this idea of \"post structuralist anarchism\" that a few people have shared with me. I decided to dip my toes into this postmodernism stuff, and it is a very heavily criticized philosophy, that accordign to many intellectuals (such as Chomsky), is nonsensical overcomplicated jargon. So far this is what I understand: \n\nThe reason postmodernism is just over complicated jargon is because it simply refers to the question of every narrative/structure based on the fact that they are influenced by preconceived notions? Which is nothing new. \r  \n\r  \nIt offers “deconstruction” as some sort of proposal? So we are supposed to “deconstruct” everything? Such a proposal makes no sense as it is an impossible task. In addition, it begs the question, is it really necessary? \rThere are many other problems with this theory besides its own obviousness. \n\nIn one of my discussions with one of these \"post structuralist anarchist\", he said the following:\n\n\"Post-structuralist anarchism, unlike traditional anarchy, rejects scientific objectivity or the vitality of rationality or human nature, which many classical anarchists held to be focal points of their philosophies. Post-structuralist anarchy was, as evident in its name, provoked by the post-structuralist movement led by philosophers such as the aforementioned Deleuze and Guattari, as well as Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, and several others. It is a rejection of grand narratives, otherwise known as meta-narratives, this encompasses most Enlightenment and modernist thought, such as humanism, the Hegelian dialectic, traditional Marxism, etc.\n\nIt is immensely different from traditional anarchy in practice. Post-structuralist anarchy does not advocate for the creation of some utopian society, or really any society at all. It is certain ethos, a way of living in which one, the individual, realizes their freedom, their autonomy and individuality, however constrained by indestructible societal structures and institutions manifested in the “Symbolic Order” it may be, to the greatest extent possible. It is when one distances themselves from the oppressive and repressive power relations and structures that plague society, he abstains from them in favor of a rhizomatic approach to life in a constant state of becoming and fluidity, of flux. Many post-structuralists do not seek to fight the state directly, for many of us do not believe it is possible to abolish not only the state but societal institutions and culture in its entirety, and thus we abstain from it as much as possible instead.\n\nIdeology is similar to Plato’s Cave in the sense that it provides a deceived vision of reality, yet to attempt to completely escape from it is impossible since one can only act within it, for one is limited to their perception and experience. The same applies to society, it cannot be destroyed because it is all-encompassing, pervasive. Culture cannot be rejected in its entirety, for man is eternally subject to it. Take language for example, can one think or express themselves devoid of language? No, a man who has been born into this society can never wholly escape from it. Classical anarchy continues to play into societal structures and institutions, as I aforementioned, by clinging to Enlightenment and modernistic conceptions such as rationality, humanism, objective science (...)\"\n\nWhat this implies is that \"classic anarchism\" is fundamentally flawed, and thus movements such as \"anarcho communism\" are impossible to achieve. \n\nIf postmodernism is nonsense, then post structuralist anarchism is also nonsense. What post structuralist anarchism is stating is the obvious, such as man being \"eternally subject to culture and language\", to which we have been aware for a long time. Yet it offers no solution. Postmodernists are right to point out the limitations of human discourse and cognition. but it is also correct to point out that postmodernism itself is not able to produce a workable/stable philosophy or society because it necessarily precludes the required \"exclusions\" and biases that are endemic to every organizing structure. \n\nThere are many other criticisms of postmodernism, and to many intellectuals as mentioned above, its nonsense and even harmful.\n\nWhat are your thought on this? Personally, I even have trouble understanding postmodernism. The vocabulary used to explain it is confusing, and even new words were invented by its main exponents such as Derrida and Focault.",

How do you (or do you not) replace vital governmental services (water, sewage, trash collection, firefighting, mail) and privatized consumer services (like the computer that allowed me to post here)?\n\nHow do you prevent power from accumulating in private individuals acting contrary to the system?\n\nHow do you ensure equitable treatment among the citzens of the society?\n\nAre there still rules, or do you eschew that structure entirely, and just let everyone do what they want? As I understand it, most anarchists aren't really anarchists in the literal sense, and they want something more built around local communites.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

Of course, the nature of how better they are is like being given the option to be imprisoned your whole life vs being in imprisoned your whole life, but you also get a window to see out of. That seems like a notable distinction. \n\nI do not see electoralism as a way out of our current hellscape, however i see it as something that can be done alongside more meaningful steps towards something better for everyone. plus, it really doesn't take much effort at all to vote, though i know this is not a universal truth and i am certainly privileged in my state for having ease of voting. \n\nI was previously fairly sympathetic/convinced of the voting doesn't matter perspective, until a very simple thing was put to me: a trans person said something along the lines of \"repubs are ferociously anti trans/lgbt, dems are bad but less bad obviously, so vote\", and frankly this seems obvious. I don't get why people defend their decision to not vote. \n\nAlso, i understand some arguments against voting, such as that it isn't truly consensual, and that the both parties are terrible so why bother. \n\nBut i just think that it's a matter of weighing the pros and cons, and while each has a laundry list of cons and virtually no pros, the voting option in the case of voting blue is more likely to yield one less terrible con. \n\nbut yeah, i am open minded and almost want to be persuaded, but i feel like i can't honestly say i have a good response to the idea that not voting will be bad for lgbt people, as well as in ways bad for all marginalized people. \n\nI could see a new wave of fascist chest pumping and therefore violence in response to the celebration following a trump victory.

  "title": "How would you define capitalism?",
  "selftext": "So on a post about Benjamin Tucker i recently had a discussion with a libertarian marxist (i believe they were a libertarian marxist, though they never stated their ideology explicitly).\n\nAnyways we were disagreeing about the nature of capitalism. In essence, they argued that THE things that defined capitalism were wage labor and generalized commodity production. \n\nI argued that capitalism, at its core is about the private ownership of the means of production for the purpose of pursuing profit.\n\nIn essence, the source of the disagreement was about what makes capitalism capitalism.\n\nThey held up the USSR as an example of capitalism done by the state. While i do agree that the USSR was fundamentally exploitative, i am hesitant to characterize it as capitalist largely because it wasn't operating on a for profit basis. It was operating on a \"don't rebel against us and you get nice stuff\" basis. I do think however the state simply became the new capitalist class. While the incentives were slightly different, the state itself perptuated the exploitative relations inherent to capitalism, so i think there's a fair argument that capitalist relations continued under the USSR.\n\nThus to them, market anarchism, by perptuating commodity production and wage labor is fundamentally capitalist. Socialism is defined by libertarion from the commodity form and wage labor rather than workers simply owning the MOP.\n\nI would disagree, for the reasons i mentioned above but also because market anarchism more broadly eliminates the hierarchy between boss and laborer, the core power relation of capitalism.\n\nHowever, i wanted input from others. How would you define capitalism? Does commodity production neccesairly mean capitalism exists? Or, do you align with me that the essence of capitalism (and all exploitative systems) is the separation of labor from that which it works? What are the neccesary components for something to BE capitalist?\n\nWould love your thoughts!\n\nEdit: seeing that this post got put in r/UltraLeft, i was wrong in assuming they were libertarian marxist. They were a proponent of Bordiga, and so probably a leftcom",

That leaves the specialization of goods to be left out, because each community has to have some sort of essential need production.\n\nI don’t know if I’m allowed to debate in posts (the rules said to go to r/debate anarchy) but I can say, without any doubt, the specialization of a good is VERY important in an economy, especially for trade with other countries. So I was wondering if you guys could clear up how the specialization of a good works in an anarchist society.\n\nThis is my first post and as a capitalist in this subreddit, I’m totally willing to receive alot of pushback. I’m just here to learn some more about how an anarchists social political system works so I can see for myself if I really believe in my own social political system.\n\nThank you for your time.",

  "selftext": "Edit: A lot of you have talked about non-monogamy and while I appreciate the discussions, I was not implying with my post that we’d need to be in poly/open relationships in anarchy!! I was simply asking if certain boundaries, even cheating, can seem controlling to a point that it becomes antithetical to an anarchist’s beliefs, leading them to more likely pursue relationships with people beyond their partner(s).\n\nThis question (more like questions) may be strange compared to what’s usually asked, but since I haven’t seen anything similar on the sub I thought it might be interesting to ask.\n\nBy this question, I mainly ask how it differs from what we usually see today. Commonly, two people who love each other after some time will get married. It’s *generally* forbidden to cheat, and boundaries may sometimes seem as though they can be very controlling.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong, I would be devastated if my partner cheated on me, and I would hate myself forever if I cheated on them. Cheating, though, is only a thing because many people view their partners as their own. Love itself becomes property that the significant other subconsciously views as their own. Yes, it is also that an exclusive relationship doubles as a promise to be “loyal,” but loyalty itself almost seems incompatible with anarchism to an extent. Do any of y’all (anarchists) see it in a different way? Are anarchists more willing to be in open relationships (specifically because of their philosophy)?\n\nWould marriage, often a religious ceremony, still be favored by some anarchists? What would that even look like? Just a ceremony to celebrate forever with someone?\n\nAt the end of the day, this is just meant for a discussion on something not usually associated with politics/economics. I imagine we’ll all have very different answers because love is not something philosophy could describe, at least fully. I’d love to see what y’all think. So many aspects to a relationship, if y’all can talk about your own experiences and how they seem unique *as a result of being anarchists* feel free to talk about it. Thanks!",

  "selftext": "So a couple months back, I was listening to this homeless person's story.  I emphasized with him and gave him some money.  Lately, I have been noticing him in our apartment complex.  He shows up randomly and says hi to me.  Then I noticed my mail kept getting stolen and that some dude got bed bugs in his apartment.  Me and some others complained to the property manager that we need a security guard around our apartment complex.  I was really upset about my mail being stolen.  I got presents for my family over Christmas that were stolen, books that I wanted to read stolen.  So yesterday, I saw this homeless black man socializing with the residents in our apartment complex, I told him I was going to call the police, I brought him to the property manager, everyone started yelling as each other, I called the police, I got angry.  He said he was gone forever, in that moment I had a lot of regret and apologized to him.  As someone who was always interested in communism and equality, I feel extremley awful for what i did.  I feel like it was racist.  I feel like he deserves a home.  I feel very conflicted.  How would an anarchist approach this?\n\nEDIT: I know people are focusing on the stolen packages. and yeah i am a racist pos and i regret what i did.  But what motivated the most was the bed bugs actually.  Freaked me the fuck out.  The dude paid a grand total of 2,500 dollars for treatment and bites all over his leg.  and yeah my racism i guess.  He put me on edge just seeing him walk around the complex and sneak around.\n\nAlso, I want people to point out that I am putting my racism out there for a reason.  I want to improve.  I want to be better.\n\nEdit:  I read all of your comments.  It seems like everyone is wondering why i called the police which wasn't explained at all.  First of all, it was me who got the bed bugs.  I was ashamed of admitting it.  I had to pay 2,500 of my own money twice (plus the Bay Area is expensive). So I was wondering what caused it in the first place.  Well apparently someone was letting this homeless person into my apartment complex.  Then I noticed my mail being stolen during Christmas and got angry.  I confronted the homeless man, lurking about the place at night and he threatened me so my friend urged me to call the police.\n\nMy conscious is killing me inside that is why i am posting this.  I hate myself for what I did.  I will never do it again.  I want to go up to him and apologize and give him a hug.  I just got angry I guess and reactionary.  The police won't do shit anyway so it made no sense to call the police.  My friend just strongly urged me to.\n\nFor those wondering, I have an anarchist friend who has taught me a lot and I am getting more and more into anarchism and communism.  I am trying to get out of my old ways.\n\nWhat should I have done differently?  Just ignore him.  Let him be.  He is already dealing with enough as is.  I just wish people like him can have a home, food and a community.",

  "selftext": "Recently, I've come across a libertarian yt channel who has made videos debunking all things Marxism while endorsing an unfettered free market with minimal government. [One video that piqued my interested ](https://youtu.be/9_KPEo7Y-Rg)was his debunking of libertarian socialism and, wanting to challenge my beliefs, I gave it a thorough watch. \n\nWhile some of his points I can sorta argue against, there is a lot to unpack and my knowledge of anarchism isn't as great as I'm still learning the theory. \n\nSo for anyone who wants to challenge their ideals as well, I've noted his arguments against lib-socialism down below with timestamps included (though i reccommend watching his entire video first) as well as my attempts to counter his arguments which could use a lot of work tbh.\n\nI'm not expecting anyone to solo each and every point he's made, you can choose 1 or 3 of your favorite points to confute. It could be one of Mantis's points, one of my questions, or both. You get to pick your poison. \n\nI'm just really curious how anarchists with way more knowledge than me can counter his arguments or recommend sources for specific claims he makes because this video has been prying on my mind for a while now\n\nThe 2 main arguments I can't refute seems to be his overwhelming support of property rights because though I sorta get how anarchy views property as a tool used to exploit workers across the globe, it is still pretty confusing how property would function in an anarchist world. \n\nThe other argument is \"how can a collective redistribute wealth and property without becoming an authoritative, communist state?\"\n\n(All the stars below are placed next to the arguments made by Mantis for an easier read)\n\nHappy rebutting nerds.\n\n0:47 - \"Progressive Wealth Re-Distribution\" \nMantis argues that a collectivized society would eventually go down the tyrannical pipeline and a hypothetical collective would forcefully take away your farm if it's deemed too big, your house if it has an empty room, or your boat if you're not using it, all to be redistributed for the good of the group. ⭐️\n\nI have argued with some anarchists before who believe that a community should have the power to take away your plot of land or boat if they deem it as too much for your needs or is not currently in use, so they'll collectivize it on your behalf. This is clearly crossing the line from being a decentralized community to an authoritative state that forcefully takes away your possessions and personal land (if such a thing exists in anarchy) based on their interests. So is really anarchy or can this be refuted?\n\n1:54 - \"It's not possible to decide who owns what without some kind of structure of power.\" Therefore, \"community organization\" is just another term for \"state ownership.\" ⭐️\n\nTo me, I feel like Mantis is missing the point that most property would be shared by the community via collectivization (worker co-ops, community councils, syndicates, housing co-ops just to name a few) and the things that would be owned individually is obviously your personal possessions and personal land that is suited for your needs (basically nobody owning 200 acres of land when they can't take care of it all themselves). My question is, can't people clearly identify who owns what without needing a structure of power? \n\n2:34 - \"You cannot have a state with full control over property rights and have no state at the same time\" ⭐️\n\nDoes the community have the power to take away anybodys property on a whim? Or is this a gross misunderstanding of how anarchy would really work?\n\n4:54 - Mantis here argues that since property rights are not respected under lib socialism it is therefore, not libertarian. ⭐️\n\nJust because right libertarians support property rights doesn't mean they support freedom since capitalism has used property to gatekeep and exploit people of their own nation's resources while they receive none of the benefits (modern day Africa being a great example).  This is an extreme example though, I'd love to hear more reasons why private property is big bad.\n\n7:55 - After testing Noam Chomsky's economic values [in a short, but more accurate political compass test](https://www.theadvocates.org/quiz/?gad=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwldKmBhCCARIsAP-0rfyT7BT4JYTCbnHzQv-WUA9N8hvTlv0C-M5BleBsJoJTq-7UXNudppwaAuMvEALw_wcB) by \"The Advocates For Self-Government,\" Mantis argues that since most lib-socialists would prefer a national Healthcare system, free college, state welfare over private charity, state Social Security over private Social Security, and are generally against cutting government spending as a whole; they are really just confused progressives. ⭐️\n\nIs anarchists supporting universal healthcare and less privatization of vital services a gotcha moment? I can see why anarchists would prefer a national healthcare system over the horrendous, privatized system, but then they are supporting more reliance on the state, right?\n\n9:20 - Mantis argues that Tankie's are half correct in their theory that in order to achieve socialism, a strong vanguard state is required since expecting people to voluntarily give up their property rights is unrealistic, pie in the sky nonsense. ⭐️\n\nFor an anarchist revolution to happen, land will have to be taken back forcefully, though isn't that tyrannical since not everybody wants to give away their land for the good of the collective? I'm not referring to a billionaires property, but regular people who own a lot of acres of empty land. Is it justifiable to forcefully redistribute their land since it is only theirs by the consent of the state? \n\n10:17 - Mantis argues that communal ownership for the means of production will inevitably end up as state ownership every single time because the only way to secure a perpetual wealth redistribution is with a strong state. ⭐️\n\nTo have communal ownership means resources must be held in common by everyone, instead of a privileged upper class. Tankies mistakingly believe that means only having the state \"collectively\" own everything while anarchists prefer the community as a whole to own everything. However, it seems like this could only work if everyone in the community is on board, unless those who disagree would have to be trampled over for the community's interest. Which is basically the collective becoming a state of its own. Is this scenario missing out on some key info? What sort of powers would a community even hold? \n\n11:46 Mantis argues that lib socialists hide behind a wall of semantics so they can convince themselves that they aren't equally as totalitarian as Tankies. ⭐️\n\n\"Aha it's not the government man who's forcefully taking your private property away, it's a member of the syndicate utilizing direct action.\" ⭐️\n\nI've seen this being used a lot on this sub reddit. Someone asks a question and all they get is \"the community\" or \"a syndicate\" while very few actually take an in-depth look on what the person is asking. And most the time, people who use these easy answers don't end up realizing that they are being tyrannical themselves. It seems like a lot of the time \"the community\" has the same connotation as \"the state.\"\n\n\"Aha it's not violent coercion, it's justified revolutionary self defense against the bourgeoisie.\" ⭐️\n\nWouldn't forcefully taking a lot of land from an individual and redistributing it be counted as violent coercion? \n\n\"Aha it's not taxes, it's a moneyless society with social credit\" ⭐️\n\nI've never heard anarchists support a social credit system so Idk where he got this from. \n\n\"Aha it's not a welfare state, it's just a communal gold pile guaranteeing everyone gets free stuff. Thank you for your mandatory donation.\" ⭐️\n\nHis main argument here is that since nothing is truly free, the labor required to supply the community with \"muh free stuff\" has to come from someone else, but since he thinks like a capitalist he doesn't comprehend a society that is centered around mutual aid. \n\n12:48 - \"Replacing the state with some random community enforced decentralized frakentheory giant hamster system, that has exactly the same power that would normally come from an authoritative state and does exactly the same thing, doesn't mean you get to call yourself 'minimal government' \" ⭐️\n\nThis is interesting. Wouldn't a decentralized community play the same role as an authoritative state? Both are tasked with redistributing wealth, collectivizing most aspects of society, and preventing the re-establishment of capitalism. So how can an anarchist community do this without acting tyrannically? Cause Mantis argues that this can only happen with a tyrannical government.\n\n13:58 - Mantis argues that lib socialists strong support for voluntary worker co-ops and unions is really a Motte and Bailey fallacy since behind the smoke and mirrors, what lib socialists really want is to \"Destroy the entire system via violent revolution and force everyone to conform to their beliefs\" ⭐️\n\n14:51 - \"Corporations already have the right to operate as employee owned or be a co-op of some form if they so choose. This voluntary aspect already exists today, unions and co-ops are not unique to socialism nor do they require them to function\" ⭐️\n\nThere are a lot of holes in the idea that workers can \"voluntarily turn their workplace into a co-op.\" As if the parasites who own the workplace wouldn't utilize the cop's to harass and intimidate the workers for unionizing. Or simply replace every worker with a new batch of employees as if they were just cogs in the machine and not genuine human beings. Plus, with the threat of homelessness, starvation, and violence from the boys in blue; it doesnt seem very voluntary to turn your workplace into a co-op. And while some workplaces can become unionized under the system, doesn't it make more sense to have a society where every workplace is revolved around the workers needs and autonomy than keeping the exploitative, power structure?  \n\n16:51 - Mantis argues that what lib-socialists really want is a nationwide political system, not a voluntary society. ⭐️\n\n16:56 - He then claims that only a very few lib-leftists are actually willing to \"make like the amish\" and create a voluntary commune out in the woods, but for the rest of civilization, lib-socialisms goals will remain a utopian fantasy. ⭐️\n\nI don't believe anarchism can only work in the middle of woods with an amish way of life. There are probably many anarchist projects which have shown that industrial society can work under anarchy such as Catalonia and the Korean People's Association in Manchuria. Besides that however, most anarchist examples include modern day or past tribes people which Mantis would use as a reason why anarchy can only work in tribal conditions.\n\n17:06 - Mantis then argues that under this context anyone can subjectively be labeled as a libertarian and then goes on a hypothetical commune in the woods which embraces \"libertarian-authoritarianism\"  where everyone voluntarily acts as a slave to their strongest member. ⭐️\n\nI honestly don't understand this point at all no matter how many times I rewatch this part of the video.\n\nNot only that, but the top comment on the video states that even Kropotkin believed those who don't give in their fair share to the collective should be kicked out or \"disassociated with\" which, if true, completely invalidates lib-lefts voluntarianism. ⭐️\n\nSo would an anarchist society truly be voluntary in all of its aspects? Or would people who don't provide enough be out-casted?\n\n17:51 - Mantis argues that countries with free markets have provided far more to the common man than any socialist economies. ⭐️\n\nIn this part, he doesn't refute that private property leads to exploitation. Instead he points to capitalist countries and what they've provided for the common man as a way to convince people that it's okay to be exploited because then you get your 200 brands of shampoo which were made by child slaves. He ignores the alienating social order, the widespread preventable suffering of hunger and homelessness when we have enough resources for all, our untold ecological devestation, and the relentless exploitation of third world countries. \n\nIf this is what capitalists call progress then something is very wrong with the system.\n\n21:07 - Lastly, Mantis concludes that socialism will always end up as a state ownership nightmare, no matter if there's minimal or no government, because \"collectivism still must be represented and therefore can't actually own anything.\" ⭐️\n\nThis sounds really stupid to ask, but are you allowed to own things in collectivism? And does collectivism result in totalitarianism every time?",

But to me it just seems like it’d be irrelevant in an anarchist society, in my mind people would just exist and cooperate as people. \n\nThough, thinking about it more, “societal norms” I guess may continue with anarchist societies.

  "selftext": "Also posted in r/DebateAnarchism\n\nSo I've been thinking about power generation as of late.\n\nPart of me is a big advocate of the hacker ethic and the idea of undermining systems for your own advantage. I think that's quite cool.\n\nBut then I also recognize that in a truly anarchist system, where all MOP are held in common, undermining the commons amounts to stealing from your neighbors and comrades rather than some rich asshole.However, I do enjoy the challenge.\n\nSo, I've specifically been imagining the following scenario:Imagine a power generation facility. The most efficient and fairest way possible to distribute resources would be as follows:\n\nIf you use x% of the power you pay x% of the bill (i.e. if you use 10% of generated power,you're in charge of covering 10% of the costs of that power, so labor, resources, etc. For communists out there it needn't be measured in money or anything, it just means that of the inputs put in you are in charge of covering 10% of them). \n\nThe other way to do this would be if you charge an equal amount to everyone. I.e. if there are 100 people using this power plant and the power plant takes1000 labor hours to run then everyone must contribute 1000/100 = 10labor hours worth of labor for access to the power plant. (So if it takes say 1000 labor hours to maintain a solar farm through cleaning or basic repairs or whatever, you're responsible for providing 10 of them). \n\nNow the downside of this is that those who use more power are charged less and those who use less are charged more. The benefit is that there isn't as strong an incentive to undermine the system because everyone contributes the same amount (of course there could still be a free rider problem,i.e. you contribute nothing but still take out power, but that's true for any commonly held resource). So the first system seems more fair but the downside is that it incentives those who use more power to figure out a way to externalize the costs they must pay onto others. In essence the incentive structure of the first system for those who use a lot of power is to try and get it to look like the second and the reverse is true in the second system. \n\nSo, would a\"hacker\" following the hacker ethic prefer the second or first?What do you think is the most fair approach to this? Everyone should have access to the power plant but how do you prevent against theft/free riding (taking without contributing) on any large scale?What's the most fair system with the best incentive structure? How do you deal with undermining the rules of the commons and minimize the incentive to do so?",

  "selftext": "Proudhon says property, or the right of increase, comes from a social (or even sacred) ceremony.  Proudhon also asserts that natural capital, such as a field, cannot be considered to perform labor on itself, and specifically argues against Jean-Baptiste Say's idea that the soil itself produces utility and is thus deserving of increase.\n\nThere is a social/sacred dedication ceremony which enables the individual to inhabit their entire body mentally, like a divinity in their sanctuary. By means of this dedication, the substance of their body becomes converted into the person of the individual, who is regarded as ever present in their form.  There is also the ceremony of consecration and anathema, which makes known to all that they must seek the proprietor's permission before they can touch/use their body for any purpose; and pronounces every violator of the individual's bodily autonomy sacrilegious, infamous, amenable to the secular power, and deserving of being handed over to it.  It's the extension of these ceremonies to non-body objects that creates the conception of property Proudhon writes against.  I am not actually the field that I own, I am not actually the pancreas that I own, its a sacred rite that my person 'inhabits' these things.  The justification of applying the sacred rite to body-property seems the same as for non-body-property (especially from a perspective of monism where there is no true line between body and non-body).\n\nIf we shift all conception of property away from the sacred rite and towards use and possession, we would be losing the power of the anathema, and a whole aspect of bodily autonomy.  With no right of increase, if I fell into a coma, and the only thing keeping me alive was a group of people laboring to feed and hydrate me, and keep my heart pumping and my lungs breathing, would they have the right to keep all the insulin that the pancreas produced during that time?  There was no intelligence in the body to be performing labor, so the pancreas becomes no different from a fallow field, deserving no right of increase for the labor that other people perform upon it.  \n\nProudhon proves that the right of increase is 'impossible', but looks right past the fact that it is supernaturally created, so it doesn't matter if it is impossible.  Each person just needs to decide for themselves whether it's a ceremony we want to perform in our society; whether we want to be able to convert matter into a divine sanctuary for our personhood, or let go of control over our perceived material surroundings, keep our personhood out of the physical realm, and just allow nature to unfold.",

  "selftext": "So in the mutualist analysis of capitalism, why do firms tend to specialize?\n\nHere's what I mean:We tend to view companies as like arms manufacturers, or car manufacturers, or steel manufacturers, etc. A company is generally geared towards specialized production. Now, this is purely in the production, not distribution sphere. Distributors tend to have many sorts of products (see Walmart, Amazon, etc).\n\nWhat I am getting at is why do production oriented firms tend to specialize within the capitalist system? My first guess would be economies of scale and higher productivity of individual workers enabling a greater surplus.But then I was doing some reading on r/mutualism and here and recently and came across the notion that in a mutualist society, we may not expect to have specialized manufacturing, instead factories would be more general purpose. Why the contrast? Why would we not expect specialization like we do in capitalism? what is unique about capitalism that leads to the specialization of factories and production more broadly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nSo I did some more thinking. Basically is it because mutualism tends to look at a problem and given resources and say \"how do we solve this problem\" whereas capitalism looks to maximize surplus?\n\nSo in essence, factories and production facilities/shared tool libraries would be more general purpose as they are oriented around solving common problems rather than simply producing profit.\n\nIn essence the difference lies in the purpose of the tools and therefore their use. So general purpose tools have a higher value because they can solve more problems within a mutualist context, but in a capitalist context they don't allow for the hyper specific specifications of mass manufacturing and therefore don't maximize profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs that correct?",

Infrastructure could of course be significantly improved, but the problem that the average American faces isn't in the availability of resources, but the affordability of resources. Housing, medicine, food, electricity, transportation, and everything in between. We have enough of all of these things to go around so that they're all readily available to everyone in excessive amounts. \n\nWhile a centralized planned economy would no doubt be the most significantly beneficial system for many nations right now, I doubt such a necessity exists within the USA. Although there are a handful of mindless anti-union talking points in the south and workers here may have been thoroughly brainwashed into having a visceral response to certain political words, they nonetheless are capable of recognizing what is in their best interest. The culture in the south isn't the main problem standing in the way of unionization - \"right to work\" is the problem. I'm convinced that unionization would take off in a big way in the south if right-to-work laws were removed.\n\nRadical direct democracy and worker self-determination are very popular here (in rural Georgia, at least). Many other political positions of locals lead me to believe that syndicalism and (to a lesser extent) municipalism would be popular in the south and these strategies would ultimately shape the revolution all across the USA.\n\nI'm not trying to predict the future here, I'm just trying to determine what to plan for and what strategies have the highest likelihood to yield successful results.

I believe that most of their supporters are in favor of the free market ideas the party expresses but oppose them on social issues[1].\n\nGiven the lack of any other major parties supporting the free market, and the elections laws which enforce a two party system[2]. People's choice is limited to either \"free market and authoritarianism\", \"socialism\", or not voting.\n\nWith all that, I wonder if authoritarianism is a greater threat than capitalism, and if we should support the development of free market parties with the goal of creating a better environment for the development of anarchistic or other radical ideas?\n\nNote that I would never vote for such a party, and I am not suggesting that. I mean support them against authoritarianism, help them express their ideas in an environment where such thing is not possible (media control, police brutality, etc).\n\n[1] The government has been accused of corruption, has been caught lying, has been actively using the secret services to spy on other parties and reporters, implemented a more punishing prison system, and has supported nationalism.\n\n[2] It's not a two party system in the typical sense, we have a parliament. But, the leading party gains a huge bonus granting them total control of all decisions, except for constitution amendments which need a strong majority.\n\nEdit: Many have explained the connection between authoritarianism and capitalism. Also, while researching today I found the term \"Authoritarian Capitalism\", which seems the natural evolution of every \"successful\" capitalistic regime. Do you think there is a point in the distinction? aka is there a point to reverting authoritarian capitalism back to capitalism, or it's a lost cause/waste of effort and resources?",

Despite the celebration with dance and music at its headquarters, the guerrilla group once glorified as a new beacon of hope by the prominent pseudo-lefts manifests all the symptoms of an approaching collapse...  \n>  \n>Even within their territory, however, the experiment of local “autonomy” has nothing to show for it. Along with the rest of Chiapas, which remains the poorest state of Mexico, the EZLN communities have been dragged by the global capitalist crisis into the same storm of violence, repression, persistent deprivation and outward migration...  \n>  \n>In a series of communiqués, it announced that, except for existing private plots, Zapatista land will become “non-property” or “common land” which explicitly will not be “ejidos”, a traditional form of communal ownership of the land combined with individual use of a few hectares at a time. Instead, it will be open for cultivation by non-Zapatistas, including several hectares for “national and international civil society.” The plan is for so-called Local Autonomous Governments (GAL) to manage these properties.  \n>  \n>Removing the empty tag lines, this is a plan to set up a political structure that will encourage outside investors and increase proceeds for the Zapatista leadership, which already taxes individuals and imposes a 10 percent tax of agricultural income of families, according to a leaked military report. Among other initiatives to reach out to non-Zapatistas, their plan can be summed up as, “If you can’t beat them, join them”...  \n>  \n>El Pais reported leaked internal documents of the Mexican military showing an even greater surveillance of the EZLN than the drug cartels, with one military report from January 2020 discarding any danger to the Tren Maya project, concluding that the EZLN simply does not have the resources to oppose it.   \n>  \n>The EZLN leadership however has responded by isolating itself further and making appeals to the same capitalist government to defend it.

  "selftext": "I've seen many posts on this subreddit talking about what should be done with certain kinds of criminals in an anarchist society. The kinds of people that continue to commit horrible acts of violence despite attempts at rehabilitation and reintegration into society. People who remain a danger to those around them. The responses I've seen are things like \"they should be exiled,\" or something vague like \"the community will decide what is done with them,\" or something like that. These answer don't satisfy me.\n\nThere seems to be an effort to avoid talk of imprisoning people, and understandably so. I'm all for prison reform/abolition as someone with anti-authoritarian tendencies, and I imagine many anarchists would feel similarly. However, the discussion around this topic has always kind of bothered me and I'm trying to understand why.\n\nThis is the way I look at things. If someone is definitely a danger to those around them (i.e. they have a history and a habit of violent behavior and either cannot control it or intentionally indulge in it), it would make sense to me that you would want to limit their contact with other people to minimize the harm they would likely do to others. One way to do this that seems effective to me would be to keep them at some sort of facility, provide them with what they need to survive, and check up on them regularly to make sure they aren't hurting themselves or others and make sure they have what they need to be comfortable. Maybe something like an indefinite rehabilitation. There is one problem I have with thinking in this way.\n\nIsn't that just prison but maybe a little nicer? And if so, is there a better option or an anarchist way of doing what I've described? Could there be an anarchist prison?\n\nMaybe I'm just having a problem imagining something different than what already exists. Or maybe I'm ignorant about these kinds of things and you can point me towards resources I can use to educate myself.",

  "selftext": "This question assumes the anarchist region is next to at least 1 capitalist region, and is no bigger than a city.\n\nI think mass death is kinda inevitable. Not in the eco-fash way, but rather that capitalism has created large groups of vulnerable people that will have no support in dealing with its ramifications (climate change, eventual scarcity of essentials, etc). They will experience natural disasters, civil war, authoritarian regimes, and other vehicles of mass death that overwhelmingly affect the poor.\n\nI dont want this. I want to be convinced that it can be avoided under anarchism (at least enough for population decline to be shouldered by lower birth rates).\n\nIssues:\n\n1. Several essential supply chains will rely on external regions. Despite the immense waste of capitalist production, I think most, if not all densely populated places on earth lack the capacity to be self-sufficient. Cities are also incapable of large-scale agriculture, which probably limits their bargaining power with capitalist regions as that’s a very immediate need. How do you participate in these supply chains without conceding to capitalist demands?\n\n2. unless you maintain the same or better quality of life for workers with valuable skills, they are materially incentivized to go somewhere else. Many might stay on principle, or because of loyalty to the people there, but many would leave if their QoL declines. \n\n- The benefits many well-paid workers get right now are built off exploitation of consumers/taxpayers/other workers (e.g. well-paid surgeons benefit from price-gouging health insurance). A society with more equal resource distribution would likely result in their QoL declining.\n- Essential programs may require disruption of the status quo that aren’t appreciated. E.g. housing the homeless without expanding the region may require people sharing their homes or lower-density suburbs being replaced by apartments, and either would have opposition.\n- what happens to the internet (and tv)? It’s the most effective tool of capitalist/fascist propaganda and very costly to maintain, but it’s also essential for long-distance communication, and has funny videos of cats :3. Seriously, no internet or restricted internet would be a dealbreaker for a lot of folks, even if they sympathized with anarchists.",

Even leftists will all be impacted and we may (well I guarantee a lot already have but i’m talking about western leftists)  get seriously hurt or even murdered by the government for spreading “evil woke liberal propaganda” or whatever\n\nCapitalism is failing and the ruling class or rich people will now revert towards defending capitalism at all costs.. Aka their very unearned and bloodied cash flow. \n\nHowever it really worries me about how badly these upcoming years will be. With global warming also a very problematic thing thanks to billionaires destroying the planet (for most of life including humans) all for a stupid social construct… \n\nI seriously hate how billionaires are literally going to make the human population extinct just because of green paper that is inherently worthless… Is it like that serious for them? Money is only valuable because humans assigned it value, no other animal species even has something like money… FURTHERMORE, money hasn’t always even existed in human history…. ughhh\n\nI would love the idea of **[redacted due to reddit guidelines]**… well socialism achieving its goal but change is never immediate and socialism (especially anarchy) is still unpopular for most people… Not to say socialism failed since this happens most of the time but it’s so infuriating seeing the general population go against their interests (aka living not in total hell) and blaming their issues on the “degenerates” which can mean just about anyone that slightly challenged the status-quo lol\n\nKind of a vent or whatever but the future worries me a lot.. when i’m usually just apathetic of it…",

  "selftext": "**A South Reforged** \n\nHello! This is my first time commenting on the r/Anarchy101 space, and hopefully I can perhaps find the answers I'm looking for here. So, with this said, let me give a very brief idea of what I intend to create, and hope to create with close guidance of realism. Back in the USSA was a novel made in 1997 as an alternate history of the US going through its own revolution of sorts, creating a Federal One-Party Socialist Republic. I, like many alternate historians, like building upon either others work or reimagining ideas to fit a more unique timeline. \n\nSo, what's my question? Well, one of the important aspects of this timeline is the \"South Reforged\" idea, or in other words the Libertarian Socialist/Anarcho-Communist/Anarcho-Syndicalist Southern United States. A lot of the Anarchist philosophy grows due to African-American activists, though understandably even in my timeline this has ill effects due to \"Social Reactionaries\" within the Anarchist movement. So, my question is this... what are some prominent, or maybe even unknown, Anarchist thinkers from the American South in the years of 1923 - onwards? Right now I am focusing on getting the first Anarchist leaders set up since there is a current within the movement for Anarchists to serve as First Secretaries within the states to push Anarchism through state intervention. This would of course spark its own ideology but thats beyond the point. \n\nTo simplify, my question is...\n\n1.

The current state of world governments gives power to very few people and leaves little choice to the citizens or simply follows the whim of the many rather than what is right. I would prefer it if a government existed which was rudimentary in the sense that the people retained power to dissolve it and where the decisions are made by the educated.

I understand the immediate demands of landback, but am a bit more confused about the long term goals.\n\n I've seen it said that landback is returning control of stolen lands solely back to the indigenous groups that originally occupied it. My question is if this would leave room for democratic action. If someone is not indigenous, would they, under landback, have a say in the laws and community they have to live under? If so, would indigenous people truly be in control of the land as they are a relatively small group compared to the rest of the population in these areas? I absolutely agree historically the land has been stolen, but I'm unsure of how 'control' over the land could be ceded back without effectively creating an ethnostate. While I absolutely support the indigenous plight, I still don't think they (or any ethnic group) is 'inherrently' good and think that giving any one group undemocratic control over other people living there will ultimately result in the sorts of egregious policies we have seen from other ethnostates.  I'm reminded, for example, how many (most?) of the initial zionist settlers of Israel had delt with oppression, and yet given different material conditions were entirely capable of being oppressors in a different context. How could democratic control by the people who live on land be maintained while also establishing indigenous control?\n\n\nEDIT: Someone rightly pointed out my phrasing around democracy might clash with the views of many anarchists. I guess a better way to phrase it is how can people govern themselves and their own communities if power is still in the hands of a particular ethnic group?",

  "selftext": "I've often wondered if this were true. If you look at the lives of most anarchists, including the most famous ones, we see that most are nonconformists living on the margins of society. Many, if not most people who become anarchists often have had bad experiences with bullies i.e. people in positions of authority like teachers, cops and politicians. It seems to me that people become anarchists because they don't fit in or belong anywhere. As a result, many know what it's like to be the odd man out, the underdog, the black sheep.\n\nI don't think this is true of socialists and communists (i.e. Marxist-Leninists) though, who are usually rigid conformists. They often have a history of bullying people who disagree with them, much like their liberal and conservative counterparts. Socialists and communists stigmatize dissent and lock outcasts and nonconformists away in mental institutions and gulags. Furthermore, \"champagne socialists\" exist, but the same doesn't exist for anarchists.\n\nIntuitively, the idea anarchists are usually drawn from the ranks of outcasts and nonconformists shunned by society sounds true, but if I were to make an argument based on intuition, it would be a fallacy. I would be interested in knowing whether any research into the personality and behavior of anti-authoritarians has ever been carried out, similar to the pre-existing research into the personality and behavior of authoritarians.",

Hell even if you're in somewhere with much less access to guns and many fewer public shootings, you've probably heard about the American epidemic of mass shootings.\n\nI just watched Anark's abridged video about guns, and I feel conflicted when people bring up government gun regulation either for or against.  On the one hand, I agree that a trained and armed minority is better off than an unarmed minority, especially if you're not white or transgender or any other targeted group. And obviously, I'm an anarchist, generally I'm not a big fan of the government getting involved in people's self defense, especially if its limiting it.\n\nOn the other hand, I feel like banning assault weapons (I don't think banning all guns makes sense) is our only hope right now. The research has shown that statistically, fewer suicides and gun murders happen when guns are restricted. And I, like probably most Americans, am sick and tired of hearing about the latest 8, 10, 12 people, kids even, who just got shot. Its infuriating, and its sickening that I'm almost numb to it.\n\nAnark talks about needing guns for a potential leftist revolution or for self-defense in case society collapses. I don't want to minimize self-defense, but this also just doesn't seem realistic to me. He talks about previous groups, and I often hear the Black Panthers as an example of an armed leftist group. But that was before Sandy Hook, and Uvalde, and all the many other shootings.\n\nIt's like when people talk about government regulating pollution and climate change. Should we focus on long term solutions, such as the eradication of capitalism and the state? Absolutely. But if government action is a) more feasible than a full-scale revolution, as it seems to be at least for gun control, and b) what it takes to prevent at least some of these awful deaths? Then yeah, I'll sacrifice my politics a little. I'm all in favor of long-term change, but I also like short-term things that save lives of, once again, literal children.\n\nWhat about you all? I doubt anyone here opposed armed self-defense, and obviously there are root causes to be addressed--mental health, toxic masculinity and individualism, and many more--but what about gun restrictions, as a short-term response?\n\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone who replied. I'll be honest I was considering deleting this post because I feel a little embarassed in retrospect, as  I posted this after going down a shootings-news rabbit hole but now I can see where I'm wrong, so I'll leave it up.\n\nI've already mentioned it in a few of my replies, but I think if gun control by the state is discarded, then the question would be, what next? COVID heightened it for obvious reasons, but I often feel like I'm not doing enough or able to do enough to build community. I'd love to organize, but even apart from some barriers in my personal life that I'd rather not discuss, I feel too isolated from most of the people around me to really do anything meaningful.\n\nI know these are not problems that can be solved in a day, or by a single person. But any suggestions for ways to counteract this violence (apart from owning a firearm personally, which is something I may look into), would be much appreciated. Again, thanks for all the insight.",

It's mostly been reading shorter articles and reddit posts on veganism (haven't read anything more in depth yet about anthropocentrism or anti-specieism yet) but veganism seems like the way to go for me at least. I haven't made any changes to my diet yet but I'm hoping that comes soon after I do some more research.\n\nOne thing that bugs me though is that veganism seems to have far more arguments based on ethics and morality than anarchism in general. For example, I like that anarchism has no real notions of \"rights,\" and it's instead just people coming to mutual agreement. A lot of vegans, on the other hand, advocate for \"animal rights\" and talk about the reduction of animal suffering as a moral good in itself. As someone who believes in amoral anarchism, these arguments don't really make sense to me and it's weird to see them pushed so hard.\n\nSeeing these arguments so often has made me wonder about ethical/moral arguments in general. For both anarchism and veganism, do ethical/moral arguments have merit/even make sense? Are they effective for pushing anarchism/veganism?",

  "title": "Post-Scarcity, Anarchism, luxury goods, and the demand for these goods",
  "selftext": "So I am of the belief that anarchism cannot be reached until post-scarcity is reached. I'm sure that's probably a point of contention for some, but I will be honest it's likely not something I can be convinced of otherwise. If that predication ruins your ability to respond or is a fallacious starting point, fair enough.\n\nHowever, I would still like to start this discussion with, at least just for the sake of argument, assuming that post-scarcity needs to be true for anarchism to work. And let's assume that is achieved. Given that, I have been having trouble trying to wrap my brain around one point of contention: luxury goods. \n\nWhile I accept the idea that luxury goods could be made and given out freely (because we are all here for the benefit of everyone, not just ourselves), my problem is the scarcity surrounding that. Post-scarcity I think needs to be discussed more in not just the *materials* side of it, but the production, manufacturing, and *logistics* side of it. \n\nSpecifically around things that are \"luxury goods\". Or, rather, more specifically from there, goods that require specialized skills to produce. Things that take an artisan to produce. My worry here is how we can meet demand for things that require time, patience, and skill. We could not reliably, or even fairly, ask an artisan to spend their entire life creating goods for people at a rate they likely will never be able to match. Is it a fallacy to assume demand will somehow \"magically\" outstrip production? And that things that already have low demand will likely have enough production to reach them? Simply put, things that were never outstripped by demand before will not be outstripped in a post-scarcity anarchist society. \n\nSo how do we deal with items that are scarce due to the fact that they require an artisan to create? Is there the potential that even *artisan* crafts can be automated to the point where the human element is removed entirely? I feel like, in order for anarchism to function, the human element needs to be removed from the equation for virtually every single good that exists. I'm sure I could be convinced otherwise, but I am having trouble believing that human demand can always outweigh human need. \n\nIt's not even an argument of people refusing to help others, simply that there aren't enough *people* to help others and that no one cares enough to learn it. I'm having trouble thinking of any good off the top of my head that requires skilled human artisans to make... maybe calligraphy brushes, fancy pottery, hand-made instruments, a hand-woven blanket, for example. Should the push be towards replicating that human hand-woven blanket with machines, rather than trying to motivate enough people to learn this skill so that demand could be met?\n\nOr is the answer for luxury goods largely rooted in consumerism? Will demand for these luxury goods, that are arguably unnecessary for human quality of life, naturally just decrease to zero because they are not lead by this desire for more? I've been thinking about a lot of goods that are \"luxury goods\" today and have been considering the thought that likely most of these things just die out because the wants and needs of consumerism will go away and reduce our desire for these extraneous goods. It's sad to think about, in a way. All these cultures and methods for making beautiful crafts dying out, but I guess that's just been the human experience forever. There have always been things and cultures and crafts dying out.\n\nI'm worried people will be burnt out trying to reach demand and resort to hoarding their goods or recognizing the importance of their skill and use it to their advantage. Is this unfounded? Would they likely instead open their arms to apprentices they can teach their skills to? What happens if demand is there but there is no one willing to take up the mantle to create it? Will humans then have to find a way to create it artificially or will it simply die as an art? \n\nHow do we deal with people who do not want something made artificially, even if the human made one is worse than the machine made one? Or is it another case of people not knowing any different so they simply have no desire or even care to see the other side?\n\nHow do we get over this desire of \"fairness\" and the want of having luxury goods, i.e. \"I want that, how do I get it.\"? I don't know how much of that is rooted in consumerism or simply human nature. Is a desire to collect things from consumerism or human desire to collect cool objects? How does it work for priceless, one-of-a-kind objects? How do we determine who gets what? Do we just not let *anyone* have it and make it part of the collective whole for everyone to enjoy (i.e. museums)?\n\nLots of rambling here, trying to just vomit out some of my thoughts and maybe can clarify more with questions.",

Who will stop some evil guys (be it government or corporations) to program bots in such a way, that they will deny services, or even harm (cop robots) people in order to enforce authority.\n\nWhat about education? Since people don’t really need to work, what will school teach?\n\nWe are fully dependent on robots in that post-scarcity scenario. This could be used for not-so-good purposes.",

From what it seems to me anarchism depends on the Hope that people would cooperate to make the transition to a society with none existent hierarquical central government or Hierarquical companies. Or how would an Anarchist deal with someone that takes advantage of it?  \n\n\n2- What do Anarchists think of Crypto like Bitcoin and other forms of Decentralised Finance? Since Bitcoin is not controled by anyone alone would it be the anarchist ideal means of trade as the hierarquical system is absent, no central bank/government controlling it etc? Or is it also not compatible with anarchism?  \n\n\n3- Do you have a ''realistic'' vision where we can transition from Capitalism to Anarchism at a ''Millions of people level''?  \n\n\n4- General things I think may be relevant for you to challenge my beliefs or bring up arguments and I encourage you to do so!!! : I am centre right politically, liberal both socially and economically, studied Law, work in a Bank, salary is a bit above national average, I'm in my early twenties, honestly don't struggle financially, I'm kinda minimalist and try to save when possible (that means yes I hoard capital as much as I can), don't feel exploited at work, remote worker if that matters, always voted on every election possible.  \nIn short my economic view is that we should tax more on consume instead of people wages so that people are more free to where they use what they gain from work. I honestly view capitalism as cooperation although the more globalised we are I'm afraid large concentrations of wealth will be inevitable.  \n\n\n5- How would an Anarchist society cope with large projects and work relations in general? For example a 100ft building for people to live? I think in an anarchist society we could have a smilar organisation of resources but without the authority and the concentration of profit right? But building large projects requires complex knowledge, at the end of the day we would have someone in the place of an engineer (even if not hierarquicaly, an engineer in terms of knowledge) telling other people what to do otherwise we could not build anything remotely complex, wouldn't it be incompatible with anarchism? Or would it be ok since the other people (those in the place of workers) would be willing to cooperate and no one was forcing them to do it? They just wanted to do their bit in society and help build it so they accepted the instructions of those more knowledgeble? But at the same time wouldn't that be scarily to similar to what we have now in terms of work and salary, in todays world there is no rule to tells us where we have to work, we pick the place that looks best to us or at least ok and we willingfully take part in that hierarchy or no?\n\nPS: Not an English speaker do not murder me for bad english please\n\n  \n\n\n&#x200B;",

It's seen as if unowned becomes rightfully owned. E.g. by working a field.\n\nIt totally ignores that so-called unowned resource was common before appropriation, that was giving economic value of natural resource to all people for free. E.g. common pasture or beach.\n\nWe can conceptualize it as all (local) people being shareholder of the common asset. Privatization robs everyone of their share with no compensation.\n\nThe result is that common people lose the means of subsistence they traditionally had.\n\n*Proletarians appear* - people whose only means of subsistence is selling labor for wages.\n\nThere's urgency to find a job that feeds you. You have little bargaining power on the conditions.\n\nThe rich who can survive for long without working now can take advantage of the poor, i.e. low wages, bossing around, unreasonable interests.\n\nExploitation happens. Rich get extra rich. Poor remain poor.\n\n**Under Georgism**\n\nLand (uncreated natural resources) is everyone's.\n\nNobody is entitled for economic rent (in classical sense).\n\nIf you exclude people from some resource, you need to compensate everyone for it's raw, unimproved real market value.\n\nHence, eveyone has a share of natural wealth. Whether it's self-employment in subsistence farming or income from dividents, you have other means of subsistence other than selling your labor.\n\n*Proletarians cease to be a thing.*\n\nNow there's no urgency to sell your labor. If you think it's a good deal you go for it, but you don't have to.\n\nIt changes everything, as now, bargaining with an employer, you have much stronger position. Employment gets voluntary, a way to have extra.\n\nIn a developped economy where dividents from land are high work itself becomes optional.\n\n**How to coordinate it with Socialism?**\n\nSo, under Georgism a good half of means of production are socially owned.\n\nHowever, artificial capital goods are still privately owned, on the moral premise that you own what you produce or buy, and on pragmatic premise that profitability of advanced tools stimulates their production.\n\nGeorgism is aimed at growth and incentivizing effecient organization of business.

  "selftext": "Recently I've been more and more interested in market forms of socialism. Here are a few ideas I've been having, and I ask of you to point out their shortcomings, share your perspectives, and point me to resources where these ideas have already been explored, because I'm sure they're not original.\n\n  \nFirst, where I'm coming from. I believe in justice and oppose injustice, everyone does :) Injustice I define as the act of taking advantage of someone, having them do something for you, while disregarding their own interests. On the opposite, doing something altruistically is good, and everything in between is neutral.\n\nTo cut a long story short, the reasons why capitalism is unjust are as follows:\n\n\\- Absolute private property is theft - you can't just claim something for yourself, like a piece of land or an idea. The notion of property is useful most of the time and should be respected, but should never be absolute. On the opposite, taking peoples toothbrushes will sow distrust and should be avoided.\n\n\\- Most modern companies are authoritarian in their structure, where lower ranks have no influence on the trajectory the company takes. And while this isn't morally good or bad in itself, authoritarianism structurally incentivises injustice, besides also alienating the lower ranks.\n\n\\- The concept of publicly traded companies with shareholders incentivises management to take advantage of the society at large in order to grow in times of bull market, as well as take advantage of their own employees in times of bear market.\n\n\\- Money=influence, which incentivises elected representatives to represent those with money as opposed to their own constituents.\n\nThese are the main ones. Now what do we do with that information, how do we construct a society that will structurally reward justice?\n\nCapitalism is a system in which people with money and influence use them to get even more money and influence through the medium of the market. So let's critically examine money and the market.\n\nI believe in David Graeber's position (at the risk of misrepresenting it) that money is a recorded, formal account of debt. And the need for money is in reverse proportional to the amount of trust between people. Here are a few examples:\n\n\\- Between close friends and within a family money is not needed. If you make a favor for somebody, informal debt is placed on the other party, and you expect them to pay it back in more or less equal amount. Issues arise when more than two people are involved - if person A made a favor for person B, person B to person C, how can person A expect that person C then makes a favor for them? If he reasonably could, that would be actual communism.\n\n\\- If you have no trust with the other party, you can only record debt in a medium that is in itself self-evidently valuable - like gold or silver. Gold and silver historically have been in most demand in times of war and crisis, where you can't trust in the value of anything else.\n\n\\- If you have no trust in the other party, but you both have trust in a third party, you can hand over the gold and silver (self-evidently valuable items) to them, have that party issue convertible bank notes, and exchange those. If a crisis arises that disturbs your faith - you can get the gold and silver back.\n\n\\- If this arrangement lasts for a while and you don't expect a crisis in the future - you can omit the deposition of valuables and just deal in banknotes without backing. That is the highest form of trust achieveable between parties short of pure informal debt.\n\nBecause money is an expression of debt, debt is integral to interpersonal relationships, and exchange of money for goods and services constitutes the market, I do believe that a market is inherent to societies. The question then becomes, how do we create such a market that structurally rewards justice, unlike capitalism, which does the opposite.\n\nFirst of all, I'm in favor of real, actual communism - and I have shown that this kind of communism requires absolute trust between people. This is not achieveable overnight, so we need a market that structurally rewards trust, which will both lead to communism in the future, and when conflicts arise and people stop trusting each other, will provide a fallback option, that will overtime, again, lead to communism.\n\nSecond of all, markets should be free, because monopolistic tendencies incentivise injustice. Different kinds of goods and services by their nature have a degree of natual monopolicity to them, and in such cases formal processes should be devised to fairly evaluate the available options and choose the best one. This in itself requires trust - both for the companies to follow the process, and the customers to participate in it.\n\nThird, I believe that there should be mulitple currencies allowed as legal tender. A currency is an expression of trust in the issuing institution, so why would I use one that I personally don't have a reason to trust? This introduces logistical issues, but I feel this idea is worth investigating.\n\nFourth, how do we structure companies in a way that structurally rewards justice? Companies are collections of people and resources that provide a desireable product or service. Companies are also inherent to society - people constantly come together to achieve something. And on the one hand, company as a whole should respect the interests of every participant. On the other, if the company mission changes - structural changes are necessary, new departments should be created and staffed, old ones - disbanded, people fired. Won't democracy get in the way of this?\n\nI believe that this question should also be viewed through the lens of trust. I, as a regular worker, should not be expected to elect the company leader - I have no reason to trust him or have a way to evaluate his performance. I do have a reason to trust my colleagues - we are doing the same type of work, and I can compare myself to them, identifying the freeloaders and firing them. I also can elect my immediate manager - I interact with him daily and can evaluate his performance. Same goes for him - that gives us a basis for negotiating our salaries.\n\nBut how should departments interact? Should low-level team leaders elect department heads? Or should department heads appointed from above decide which teams they need, and which teams are redundant - and should be disbanded and fired. I believe that team department heads should be appointed - companies should in their essense be mission-oriented, and with that come top-down assignments - but departments themselves should be independent contractors - with them possibly offering their services to multiple different companies, negotiating their pay with each. This way, I believe, the level of expected trust between colleagues is natural, and in places where trust is not to be expected, the market will do the negotiating work to arrive at a fair compensation.\n\nThere is also the problem of the functions of the state - administration of justice, security, possibly other things. The state can be viewed as an inherently monopolistic company and treated as such. But honestly idk, I'd like to hear your opinions on this.\n\nSo, what do you all think? Also, sorry for \"he\" pronouns for gender-neutral terms - this is just my habit.",

  "selftext": "i want to start this question by noting i immensely respect the anarchist committment to liberation and equal rights of all people. but there is one anarchist talking point that I have encountered many times, and have always been completely unable to internalize. it feels very alien to me and i'm not sure i understand the anarchist position in its entirety here. this point is as follows: anarchists seem to be unable to recognize that some problems of some people are not really *caused* by society, and society would have to constantly take active steps to mitigate them, which seems different from most forms of liberation that merely require a cessation of marginalizing activity, yet this is rarely if ever recognized.\n\ni'll use myself, and groups i belong to, as an example, for fear of offending anyone or misrepresenting some other group's struggles. i am a neurodivergent (in a bad way) transgender person. i face a lot of problems in society the way it currently exists. some of these problems - such as institutions trying to take active action to prevent me from accessing care i need, or threats of violence - obviously and transparently stem from existing systems of oppression, and their mitigation requires the dismantlement of these systems and nothing else. but this seems transparently false for some other problems i face.\n\nfor example, i have problems navigating some social spaces the way normal people do, and certain inputs of information have an unpleasant effect on me. these problems are immutable - they have to do with the way i am. in a way, i will just never be able to do some things as well or as effortlessly as neurotypical people do them. in cases like this, however, anarchists seem to treat a failure to provide *active accomodations to me* as a form of oppression equivalent of being explicitly excluded for my immutable traits. even in cases when providing such accomodations makes no economic sense simply because there are not enough people needing them for how much they might cost, anarchists, including market anarchists, treat this as a problem of societal intolerance and intersectional bigotry, the same way they treat 'active oppression' that requires effort on part of the oppressor.\n\nto me, the difference between the two is obvious, and i do not see how an equivalence can ever be drawn up against them. one very clearly cannot exist in a truly free society, but the other, if taken to logical conclusion, is impossible to eliminate without organized coercive structures overseeing said efforts, at least within a market anarchist incentive structure. is there something i am missing? has this question already been answered? is this a fundamental flaw of market anarchism versus other forms of anarchism?",

  "title": "How does mutualism or market anarchism prevent fear mongering?",
  "selftext": "Right now, I think it is fair to say a lot of capitalism is characterized by fear mongering. Creating fear to sell products. Take Alex Jones for example, he fear mongers over immigrants and the \"New World Order\" in order to sell brain pills or Mike Lindel funds Fox and to sell pillows and books. \n\nThis fear mongering had done tremendous harm to our society.\n\nIt's not just right wing grifters though. Cosmetics advertises in a way to make you feel insecure and in need of their product. Or arms manufacturers play into the tacticool thing.\n\nFear mongering is pervasive in capitalism through scams and insecurities it pervades all. And it's all to sell more products. \n\nThe rationale is simple. More products sold = more income = more profit for capitalists.\n\nWhat I am wondering is, is this inherent to markets or capitalism? Are markets destined to cause fear mongering simply to sell products? If not, why?\n\nI originally thought the problem lied in artificially boosting demand but someone over on r/DebateAnarchism pointed out that new products and services need to artificially boost demand cause people may not know they need them. The problem isn't artificially boosting demand, it's manufacturers preying on insecurity and fear, i.e. fear mongering.\n\nWhy would we not expect to see that in a market anarchist or mutualist (i.e. a society that doesn't outright reject markets) society? Why would fear mongering not occur, what mechanism disincentives it? How can markets be structured in a way to prevent or at least not incentivize fear mongering\n\nEdit:\n\nPotential solution:\n\nIt occurred to me that you could involve consumers in the decision making process.\n\nAny group of workers who don't include consumers in the decision making process will likely attract less consumers for obvious reasons.\n\nBy including consumers in the decision making process, you are ensuring their interests are considered and therefore you can ensure that they aren't fear mongered to. Any group that doesn't listen to customers won't tend to have them for very long.\n\nThe problem is fear mongering and that fear mongering can only take place if consumers don't have a say in how products are advertised. \n\nSure a group of workers could independently allocate their labor to fear mongering but a) good luck keeping customers if they find out and b) what would be the point? Giving consumers a say in pricing and finances would ensure the cost principle is immediately followed and so there would be no short term gains.\n\nI think this wraps up the problem quite nicely no?",

  "selftext": "I have become increasingly interested in time banking as of late.\n\nOne thing I have been worried about though is a comparative shortage of high disutility jobs.\n\nWhat I mean by this is, if I can trade 1 hour of my time cleaning an office vs cleaning a sewer, I will obviously take the office right?\n\nThere's a much higher disutility associated with cleaning the sewer than the office right? And so wouldn't rational actors tend to avoid high disutility work?\n\nBut that got me thinking, doesn't distuility tend to correlate (though not always) with difficulty and therefore time consumption? So while cleaning sewer is much more unpleasant than cleaning an office the sewer will take longer and so the compensation will be higher simply because more labor hours were expended.\n\nA similar logic applies for like medical work. It takes a lot of time to learn how to he a doctor, and so that inherently means compensation for that time right?\n\nBut then again, couldn't you spend the same amount of time it takes to clean 1 sewer cleaning many offices? It's a lot less unpleasant no? Idk, I do really like the idea of time banking but I have been wrestling with this for a bit and would love some input.\n\nHow can time banking adequately deal with high disutility jobs?

  "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI repost this from r/anarchism since it was not suited for it and I was advised to rather post it here.\n\nBefore I start i should tell you that I am (or at least am trying to be) apolitical. I'm not here to argue with any of you, try to stir drama or convince you. But I believe people should know about others opinions and so I'm here, genuinely curious about anarchism. I mean every of following questions in good spirit, but English is not my native language, so if something sounds aggressive or condescending it was not my intention.\n\nI have read some articles on Wikipedia, older subreddit posts and other online sources but still have some questions that I would be grateful to get answers to. Every one of those questions have potential follow up questions. If this post breaks some rule please tell me and I will delete it.\n\n1) If I understand correctly then anarchism is \"lack of rulers not lack of rules\". Who and how then decides on the rules? I found some answers for this question on this sub but they were not satisfactory.\n\n2) Question of anarchist system ideology security. I haven't found any source that would define how would anarchist system defend itself from \"invasion\" of other ideologies. Let's say there would be anarchist society and one day a company would start with one person at the top and let's say three workers that would be fine with it. What would happen next?\n\n3) What are major pros of anarchist society in the sphere of economy? I understand there would be basically \"total equality\" of wealth and \"means of production\", but as a civil engineer I know that every project that has functioning leadership and organization fares far better than one with messy leadership (or in anarchist system, none). What are pros that would put anarchist system in lead against practices that are in place in capitalist systems?\n\n4) Is this system possible outside of small scale communities? Would area size of Europe for example be able to function under anarchist system? If so how? Also regarding previous question: How would this system defend itself against physical harm like war, terrorism etc? I found some answers for this question on this sub but they were not satisfactory.\n\n5) This question is based on my presumption of the answer for the fourth question. Do I understand correctly that establishing of anarchist society would result in lowering of standard of living and scale of possibilities? Again I mean it in good spirit. Lack of leadership and or organizations that would provide access to higher education, travel, etc. would mean considerable scale down of person's social circle. I suppose, I might be wrong.\n\n6) General question of anarcho-somethingsms. Anarcho-capitalism, anarcho-socialism etc. Aren't those by default contradicting themselves? Or does it mean incorporating incomplete anarchism? This question led to this post's removal from r/anarchism. I was provided answer but feel free to add your view.\n\n7) Do I understand correctly that anarchism needs capitalists and hierarchical systems for its genesis? For example: Today anarchists mostly communicate through internet. But as per my question number 3 I can't see how that (the internet) would come to be without leadership. Same with old means of communication like newspapers, phones, mail.\n\nI'll be glad for any feedback. Again I'm not here to troll, I'm genuinely interested in conversation. I won't change your view and you most probably won't change my view. Not at least in the span of this post. Just curious. :)\n\nAnyway, thanks for anybody's time and have a great day.\n\nEdit: typo",

Public transport in this case is financed mainly from city's budget (70%) and tickets (30%). City budget is mostly financed from local taxes. City eventually decided to send demand for payments to free riders that did not want to pay for it for years.\n\nSo, I don't find dogmatism appealing.

To encourage a specific type of anarchists to experiment with the idea by writing a section detailing examples (one example is working with/taking inspiration from existing groups in the peace movement.5 or by organizing ''social defense committees'' similar but different from the defense committees before and during the Spanish Revolution.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo that's the synopsis for my project, as the title says, can you give me a good site to publish stuff like this (maybe the anarchist library or libcom)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.

The definition for an anarchist context could go as follows: ''Social defence is nonviolent community resistance to aggression. This includes defence against military aggression, defence against government oppression of local communities, and defence against male violence against women. Social defence is nonviolent defence of the vital features of society -- including human rights, local autonomy, and participation -- against all oppressive forces.''\n5.

  "title": "Anarchist Econ: How do we best respond to demand shocks?",
  "selftext": "\nOk, so this is a rather technical question, as such this is rather long, so sorry for that in advance.\n\nAlright so here's the specific problem I am thinking about.\n\nWithin an anarchist economy (for our sake we'll assume a gift economy), the basic idea is as follows:\n\n\nYou give without expectation of immediate reward. The reason that I do this is because I know that I will get my needs met by someone else within out gift economy network later on done the line. But I only get those desires/needs met if I contribute here and now (necessities are a given, they will always be met. But most people want more than just necessities right? So if I want those non-necessities I have to contribute to the community otherwise they won't give them to me).\n\nOk, that's the basic idea yeah? If we want to mathematically model this, we can basically say that Consumption (C) <= Production (P). You have to add as much or more than you consume otherwise others won't be inclined to give you stuff. And that also ensures the long term sustainability of your gift economy (if consumption > production for extended periods of time, the whole thing will eventually run out of resources and collapse, this is part of the issue with capitalism).\n\nOk, so then the most common objection raised is: not all labor is equal, why would I do very unpleasant labor if I can get the same luxuries as someone who is doing comparatively pleasant labor (so, like, why would I clean a sewer if I can sit in a nice air conditioned office and do paper work?)? We will call the unpleasantness of labor \"disutility\" (borrowing from econ). Cleaning a sewer is high disutility, working in an office is low disutility (comparatively at least). My basic assumption moving forward is that people want to minimize disutility (this means minimize unpleasantness of work basically).\n\n\nThe answer that i have found in most anarchist circles is the distribution of luxuries and priorities may vary depending on the distuility of different types of labor. Basically, a higher number of hours of average disutility labor is equal to 1 hour of high-disutilty labor, and so C and P are no longer solely determined by the objective time measurement that went into production/consumption.\n\nSo if your job requires lots of training/education (like being a doctor) that is a higher disutility and as such will be compensated by higher priority for luxuries. (So for example, a doctor may be the first in line to get the biggest house on the block, or maybe they're first in line at the communal kitchen, etc). Alternatively, resources are allocated to make high disutility have a lower disutility (so the doctor gets extra help instead of having to do it all themselves, that sorta thing).\n\nThat's all fine and dandy. But that leads us to an interesting problem (the topic of this post): What happens when those who do high-disutility labor have a higher degree of bargaining power over the rest of the community?\n\n\nSay that there's a sudden disease and the demand for doctors rises rapidly. This means that individual doctors are in a better bargaining position and may demand more priorities/advantages in exchange for the same amount of labor.\n\n\nWhile it is true that doctors have access to as much luxuries as they need because they can just get them from the broader gift network, the issue is the ratio of their labor to other labor that is necessary to achieve those luxuries.\n\nSo to make this problem clearer, I will use math.\n\nL_d = Labor-time of the doctor or other high disutility worker.\n\nL_s = standard labor-time, just some standard unit used to measure average disutility labor for the rest of the community.\n\n\nSo before a sudden demand shock we have:\n\nL_s/L_d = x where x is some constant that was negotiated upon between the doctor and community. x represents the ratio of the doctor's labor to the community's labor that is necessary in order for the doctor to receive the higher priority in luxuries and whatnot.\n\n\nAfter the shock:\n\nL_s/L_d = y where y > x and L_d remains constant\n\n\nWhat this means is that L_s has risen, i.e. the rest of the community must do more work to receive the same level of labor from the doctor. This happens not because the doctor wants more luxuries, but because the doctor wants to minimize the amount of work they do and maximize their own consumption (i.e. min(P) and max(C)). So for less work they can consume as much as before basically. This is obviously not ideal.\n\nNow long term this will stabilize, because the higher L_s/L_d will attract other people to that particular line of work and therefore decrease the bargaining power of the doctor which drives the ratio back down until it is at x or lower. But the fundamental question remains: What about the interim? During the demand shock?\n\nHow do we properly prevent a rise in L_s/L_d? We could deny the doctor access to luxuries that he needs, but that also means that we're denied access to the doctor right? Long term that's not gonna be great for anyone right?\n\n\nWe could kick the doctor out of the commune after the shock as well. Or we could look for other doctors.\nBut are there other solutions? Are there other ways to prevent the doctor from raising that ratio or removing the incentive to do so? Because the incentive lies in a desire to minimize labor.\n\nI suppose what we could do is maintain a low ratio, z, where z < x and then in the future when the demand shock is lower, we can up that ratio to y temporarily as repayment for taking a lower ratio when needed. That could potentially work as it fits with labor minimization.\n\nAnother approach is requiring the doctor train others so that their negotiating power is lower.\n\nAny other approaches? What do you think is best?\n\nEdit:\n\nI do think there's potentially a case to be made that the higher y is justifiable in certain circumstances because a demand shock may entail more actual labor done (if a deadly virus is going around doctors may have to work more. This means more hours which increases the average overall disutility). This means each hour may have to have a higher ratio in order to compensate for the greater overall disutility\n\n\nSo to give a numeric example:\n\nLet's day our doctor is working 10 hour days normally and at a ratio of 2/1, i.e. x = 2. Disutility per hour is not constant, the first hour of a work day is a lot more pleasant than the last. So let's say the average disutility is about 30 utils. This means an average of 3 utils/hour.\n\nOk so now our doctor faces a demand shock. This increases his work hours to 15 a day. This has a dramatic increase in overall disutility both from the increased stress of a pandemic and from the higher hours,  leading to 600 utils over the day. 600/15 = 4 utils per hour.\n\nSo if x was 2 when utils/hour was 3 then perhaps y should be 3 when utils/hour is 4 right?\n\nHell even if we keep the hours the same this problem could still happen solely from stress of dealing with a pandemic right? So if we kept 10 hours but upped the disutility to 100 utils. Then we have 10 utils/hour right? And that's much higher than 3. So a higher ratio maybe be needed simply to account for that increase in disutility no?",

Who maintains infrastructure, like roads, rails, power lines, etc.?\n6. Do anarchists trade with outsiders? Is there import and export?\n7. Whats stopping a group or a country from taking over?\n8. How are emergencies handled? How are paramedics dispatched to an accident for example? How do they get fuel for the ambulances if the specific region does not produce fuel?\n9. How is education maintained? \n10. How is healthcare maintained? \n11. How far does the \"no hierarchy\" rule extend? Do firefighters for example have commanders? If no, than how are these things organised?\n12. Who represents the people in the global scene? Do you withdraw from world politics, or do you partcipate?\n13. Is anarchy achiveable trough non-violent means?\n14. How does this benefit people?\n\n\nThese are the questions a rambled together, i hope that they are understandable, english is not my first language and i am talking about a topic i am uneducated in.

That control is back-ended by holding the American population hostage to a system that was purposefully designed to make as little progress as possible. \n\nThe act of voting and participating in liberal democracy is what gives it a continued sense of legitimacy which it uses to hold a monopoly of violence against all of the people it subjugates.

  "selftext": "Just learned about this concept. DLed the book online \"TechnoFeudalism: What Killed Capitalism, by yanis Varoufakis\".\n\nWatched a few interviews with him. Just looking to see other peoples opinions on this topic.\n\nEDIT.\n\ni should have summarised his thoughts. I should note that, ive only read the first part of his book. But ive watched a few hours worth of interviews with him. As far as I'm aware this is his theory. Although id highly recommend researching more as im no expert.\n\nAs a very, very high level conceptual explanation: (edit drippywaffle) \n\n1. In feudal times wealth and power was concentrated in the hands of people who **rented** (lords who owned land just expropriating 30-50% of the harvest of a peasant). \n\n2. With the industrial revolution wealth and power shifted to those who owned businesses and factories and used wage labour to create things that were sold on a market for **profit.**\n\n3. With the advent of platforms like Amazon, Apple Store, Uber, etc labourers (like on Uber) and \"vassal capitalists\" (like on Amazon, Apple Store) **rent** space on these platforms to access consumers, which aren't traditional markets (he gives the example of walking down a High Street where they can custom price everything, all the buildings are owned by one guy, and he gets to choose what businesses you see). \n\n4. As these \"techno-feudalists\" are gaining more power they will displace the traditional capitalists for top dog, completing the transition. As he pointed out, there were capitalist entities in feudal times, it only became capitalism when the balance of power shifted. \n\n5. We are now also doing free labour as serfs to try and boost our own standing (linkedin, facebook, youtube) for getting hired, which creates 100% of the content for those sites, which is a kind of serfdom. Cloud capital as the OP mentioned. \n\n6. As a final bit of info, since 2008 profit has not been so important as there is a constant stream of central bank money to keep the economy on a drip feed, meaning turning a profit is not as important. \n\nI think it's an interesting idea and good for understanding the current paradigm.\n\nEdit: For an even more simplified description, it's the Apple App Store taking 30% of revenue from all sales like a lord takes 30% of grain from a peasant farmer, in both cases for the honour of being on their platform/land, rather than creating a product/service and selling it for a profit in a market like a industrial factory making toothbrushes or app developer making Angry Birds.",

Such a community could be promoted via social media or other means to further the popularity and values of anarchist principles and practice.\n\nThere is plenty of public rural land close to towns where this would potentially be viable without automatic forced eviction, and people have set up communities like this before, such as gypsy and Roma groups\n\n.Anyway, I dunno how popular these ideas would be with people on here, but it would be doing something, even if it doesn't make much of a difference on a macro-scale.

  "selftext": "I’ll start this question by stating that I’m still initiating myself into anarchism. I discovered anarchism being 18yo, moved into socialism then I’m now rediscovering it being 59yo, mainly by listening to Chomsky. I am not yet a convinced anarchist, as there’re are some aspects of anarchism that I’m not sure about and that I will ask about here.\n\nI’ll get to the point:\n\nThere is a question that I’ve never seen satisfactorily answered: if an anarchist or truly socialist party gets to power, what would be done with the distribution of wealth? Would we expropriate wealth from the rich straight away?. Because if we do so: what would happen if on the next term a capitalist party wins the elections? \n\nHere’s my proposition: why not create an anarchist party, or coalesce with an existing socialist party? We may agree, that if we wins elections for three consecutive electoral terms (let’s say of 4 x 3 = 12 years) and with an absolute majority, then the real revolution may be executed, wealth would be rightfully expropriated from the rich and a communal system be initiated. \n\nIt has been argued that anarchism, should not participate in electoral systems, as it would be contradictory to its principles. I’d appreciate being clarified why this would be so?. The question is: **if we don’t participate in an electoral system, how can we know if the majority of people support us?.** \n\nThe second question regards the need of revolution and the use of violence. My understanding is that, only if the majority of the people is ignored, then and only then would a revolution be justified. Such as Chomsky said, the burden of proof lies in any violence being used. \n\nIt seems to me that there’s no consensus amongst anarchist regarding these questions. How can anarchists attacks be justified? such as bombing capitalist landmarks, trying to kill kings, or bombing churches? do the majority of the population approve of this? isn’t it obvious that such attacks are horrific and that they are completely counterproductive? Is this the kind of anarchism that we desire? achieved by bombs and terror?\n\nI would appreciate any insights.",

  "selftext": "I was wondering if an anarchist movement got popular in a poor country, how would the process of its implementation, roughly speaking, unfold or even begin. The reason I'm asking this is that the whole process seems to be more difficult to implement in poor than in developed countries. I'm from Bosnia,  a poor country in Southeastern Europe. What I'm going to say applies overall to almost all post-socialist European countries and probably to many others on other continents.   \nWe have suffered an incredible brain drain over the last three decades. We are in deep trouble. Rural areas and even a lot of towns are suffering from a lack of doctors, engineers, teachers etc. There have recently been news for example, about how doctors don't want to go to some of these rural areas even when offered a pretty good salary. We are indebting ourselves to pay out even the goddamn pensions and salaries.   \nThere's shit ton of people who live in poverty, both employed and unemployed. So, I was wondering, if a bit prolonged transition phase would be necessary or something. If the state gets abolished very soon after a hypothetical coup, revolution or even elections, doesn't matter, a lot of people would find themselves in a terrible situation. Cutting the current welfare the state provides, however bad it might be, would just push people who are already recieving it into even more trouble. A lot of pensioners here live alone too and they would be hit pretty hard as well. Other people, even those who have somewhat decent standard of living would find it difficult to help all those in need. I think that for all reasons mentioned, getting things moving again, creating jobs etc. would be incredibly difficult.  \nSo what should be done, in broader terms, if such hypothetical case of an anarchist takeover takes place, to minimize authoritarian practices overall, deal with the money system and try to prevent things sliding into a poverty hell hole for a lot of people. Or is it even smart to go into all of this in a small, import dependent and depopulated country at all if things on a global scale remain as if they've been for the last let's say 35 years with all the imperialism stuff going on?",

  "title": "What reading of Bakunin's \"What is Authority\" Do you find more plausible?",
  "selftext": "\"[What is Authority](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/mikhail-bakunin-what-is-authority)\" is the essay Bakunin wrote that appears within *God and the State,* ultimately meant to be part of *The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution*.\n\nContextually, it comes right after Bakunin made an extended argument against idealists and theologians who wanted to argue that the idea of God was compatible with human liberty.\n\nRight before he begins then, he says this:\n\n>Perhaps, too, while speaking of liberty as something very respectable and very dear, they [the idealists and theologians] understood the term quite differently than we do, as materialists and revolutionary socialists. Indeed, they never speak of it without immediately adding another word, authority—a word and a thing which we detest with all our heart.\n\nRight after this, Bakunin considers one definition of authority then, but leaves it as an open question.\n\n>Bakunin: What is authority? Is it the inevitable power of the natural laws which manifest themselves in the necessary concatenation and succession of phenomena in the physical and social worlds? Indeed, against these laws revolt is not only forbidden, but is even impossible. We may misunderstand them or still not know them at all, but we cannot disobey them, because they constitute the basis and very conditions of our existence; they envelop us, penetrate us, regulate all our movements, thoughts, and acts, so that even when we believe that we disobey them, we do nothing but demonstrate their omnipotence.\n\n>Yes, we are absolutely the slaves of these laws. But there is nothing humiliating in that slavery, or, rather, it is not slavery at all. For slavery supposes an external master, a legislator outside of the one whom he commands, while these laws are not outside of us; they are inherent in us; they constitute our being, our whole being, as much physically as intellectually and morally. We live, we breathe, we act, we think, we wish only through these laws. Without them we are nothing–we are not. From where, then, could we derive the power and the wish to rebel against them?\n\nWe have a potential definition of authority here then: \"the inevitable power of natural laws.\"\n\nBut here is my question: Is this meant to be the *idealist* definition Bakunin is critiquing? Or the *materialist* definition he is proposing?\n\nI have read it in the former way. The idealist is proposing this sense of authority because they can \"never speak of liberty without immediately adding another word, authority\". With this definition, we could see why. For human liberty to exist, humans must exist, and therefore conform with the laws of existence. This definition also makes it clear that abolishing authority would be impossible. To abolish authority would require abolishing existence.\n\nBakunin seems to later critique this definition too. He says we are \"absolutely the slaves of these laws.\" But then he turns around and says it is \"not slavery at all.\" His reason for this is that slavery \"supposes an external master,\" which contrasts to the inevitable laws of science and mathematics which \"constitute our being.\"\n\nThe way I read this then, Bakunin is contrasting two senses of the word authority. The idealist uses it to mean necessity. Because of this, they understand the word \"quite differently than we do, as materialists and revolutionary socialists.\" For Bakunin, slavery, and authority by extension, requires this kind of external master, making it quantitatively different from the laws of physics.\n\nThis reading seemed obvious enough to me. However, I have seen that /u/humanispherian, whose work I deeply appreciate and even translated the copy of the text I cited above, offers another interpretation, found [here](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/bakunin-library/the-authority-of-the-bootmaker-2/) and [here](https://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/contrun/bakunin-on-authority-proudhon-on-property/).\n\nAccording to him, when Bakunin proposes the \"inevitable power of natural laws\" as a meaning of authority, he is proposing this as a *materialist* definition.\n\n>Humanispherian: Rather than talking about what the idealists consider to be authority, he [Bakunin] asks a question, in which we see a possible materialist definition.\n\nI would argue that Bakunin *is* telling us what the idealists consider to be authority, which he contrasts to the materialist sense in the very next paragraph.\n\nHumanispherian gives what I still consider a fairly plausible reading of Bakunin here though. Faced with an authority that is impossible to abolish, the role of the anarchist is now to promote rebellion and push it as far as possible. We push constantly to overcome these limits, reducing them as far as possible.\n\nWhen Bakunin does accept some authority, such as the \"authority of the bootmaker,\" it is read as a reluctant acceptance here.\n\n>Humanispherian: [Bakunin] bows to the inevitable, which we know is the only law he will recognize. And if our reading of the nuances is not entirely incorrect, we have no reason, I think, to imagine that he bows, even to necessity, with particularly good grace. At the limits of his knowledge, life, reason and rebellion should, we expect, all be brought to bear. In the absence of “fixed and constant authority,” developing humanity might at least aspire to less of both authority and subordination.\n\nI think this reading is probably on the right track... However, the text itself doesn't show Bakunin as all that reluctant to accept the \"authority\" of science and math. On the contrary, he mocks the idealists for trying to rebel against it themselves.\n\n>Bakunin: One must, for instance, be at base either a fool or a theologian or at least a metaphysician, jurist, or bourgeois economist to rebel against the law by which 2 x 2 makes 4. One must have faith to imagine that fire will not burn nor water drown, unless one has recourse to some subterfuge that is still based on some other natural law. But these rebellions, or, rather, these attempts at or foolish fancies of an impossible revolt, only form a rare exception; for, in general, it may be said that the mass of men, in their daily lives, let themselves be governed by good sense—that is, by the sum of the natural laws generally recognized—in an almost absolute fashion.\n\nI think Bakunin's attitude toward the bootmaker is better read if we recognize that he is distinguishing these two meanings of the word authority, namely distinguishing whether this \"authority\" is of an internal nature (the idealist sense of authority) or an external nature (the materialist sense).\n\n>Bakunin: If I bow before the authority of the specialists and declare myself ready to follow, to a certain extent and as long as may seem to me necessary, their indications and even their directions, it is because that authority is imposed upon me by no one, neither by men nor by God. Otherwise I would drive them back in horror, and let the devil take their counsels, their direction, and their science, certain that they would make me pay, by the loss of my liberty and human dignity, for the scraps of truth, wrapped in a multitude of lies, that they might give me.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I on the right track?",

  "selftext": "I've found it somewhat useful, but I haven't seen others use it. Does anyone even know about it or is it that obscure?\n\nI've only seen it used in the Anarchist FAQ, and specifically in section B.1. Forgive me for the massive wall of text.\n> This distinction between forms of authority is important. As Erich Fromm pointed out, “authority” is “a broad term with two entirely different meanings: it can be either ‘rational’ or ‘irrational’ authority. Rational authority is based on competence, and it helps the person who leans on it to grow. Irrational authority is based on power and serves to exploit the person subjected to it.” [To Have or To Be, pp. 44–45] The same point was made by Bakunin over 100 years earlier when he indicated the difference between authority and “natural influence.” For Bakunin, individual freedom “results from th[e] great number of material, intellectual, and moral influences which every individual around him [or her] and which society … continually exercise … To abolish this mutual influence would be to die.” Consequently, “when we reclaim the freedom of the masses, we hardly wish to abolish the effect of any individual’s or any group of individual’s natural influence upon the masses. What we wish is to abolish artificial, privileged, legal, and official influences.” [The Basic Bakunin, p. 140 and p. 141]\n\n>It is, in other words, the difference between taking part in a decision and listening to alternative viewpoints and experts (“natural influence”) before making your mind up and having a decision made for you by a separate group of individuals (who may or may not be elected) because that is their role in an organisation or society. In the former, the individual exercises their judgement and freedom (i.e. is based on rational authority). In the latter, they are subjected to the wills of others, to hierarchical authority (i.e. is based on irrational authority). This is because rational authority “not only permits but requires constant scrutiny and criticism … it is always temporary, its acceptance depending on its performance.” The source of irrational authority, on the other hand, “is always power over people … Power on the one side, fear on the other, are always the buttresses on which irrational authority is built.” Thus former is based upon “equality” while the latter “is by its very nature based upon inequality.” [Erich Fromm, Man for Himself, pp. 9–10]\n\n>This crucial point is expressed in the difference between having authority and being an authority. Being an authority just means that a given person is generally recognised as competent for a given task, based on his or her individual skills and knowledge. Put differently, it is socially acknowledged expertise. In contrast, having authority is a social relationship based on status and power derived from a hierarchical position, not on individual ability. Obviously this does not mean that competence is not an element for obtaining a hierarchical position; it just means that the real or alleged initial competence is transferred to the title or position of the authority and so becomes independent of individuals, i.e. institutionalised (or what Bakunin termed “official”).\nhttps://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq-full#text-amuse-label-secb1",

How can you convince a person who thinks the military protects freedom that the state hinders his autonomy? How can you convince a believer in \"equal opportunity\" meritocracy that they need to demand more for equality?\n\nFor my part, I think horizontalist structures (while not adequate to anarchist end goals) like syndicates/radical unions are an effective way to quell bigotry and get people thinking more like anarchists- just from my personal experiences watching my coworkers during union efforts. But in many ways I think any anarchist movement would struggle to immediately change the mindset of most people as things stand today- words like Freedom and Equality- things anarchism could bring about far better than neoliberal capitalism- are so used up and empty of signifiers that I find it hard to imagine bringing a popular movement together to change things without first putting most people in a situation where solidarity and mutual aid is needed to succeed (like with unions).

This means they will promote things that lead to higher weapons demand, i.e. fear mongering. \n\nBut if the laboring class as a whole owns the means of production, i can also see demand guding labor. So in a time of war, demand for weapons will be higher and so a greater amount of labor will be allocated to its production. But in peace time, demand will have shifted to other goods and labor will be allocated accordingly.\n\nThe difference between these two scenarios is who guides who. In the first, firm guides demand, in the second demand guides labor.\n\nThe second is obviously more appealing, i am just struggling to imagine what that looks like on an individual level. What does the abolition of the firm actually look like? If you have firms, they can artificially influence demand, right? So how do you organize groups of workers in such a way they cannot do this? How do you organize workers outside of firms? How do you ensure the second version rather than the first? How do you ensure demand guides allocation of labor instead of groups of workers guiding demand?",

Rojavas are under a constant existential threat, and also have some advantage from fairly remote locations. Both of these maintain their own armies and one might not want to suppose either as fully anarchist.\n\nBut if you live e.g. next to Russia or so. Without a central government that is able to collect a very significant amount of military resources, how do you create a reasonable deterrent against aggression?\n\nOr - if you rather go with a guerilla or a pacifist resistance, let them cross the border and occupy the territory in name only, while fighting against them either passively and peacefully or by waging guerilla warfare. What would stop them from committing genocide at a massive scale? That has happened before.\n\nMy usual cop out is that we aren't really realistically dismantling the government this or the next decade, so we can focus on just building the roots level stuff and solve that issue later down the road, by when the world might be a very different kind of a place.",

If a person is in psychosis/ a different mental state and would be deemed to need help by the majority of people but they themself don’t think they need help (as a lot of instances of psychosis could manifest), would Berkman think involuntary treatment would be justified?\n6. Under capitalism, wouldn’t it be true that at least some people would want to kill someone the moment government ceases to exist. We could attribute this need for violence as a result of imprisonment for example. As a lot of people who have been incarcerated are recidivists.

  "selftext": "There is no free market under capitalism; what we have is a trend toward market concentration over time, creating an environment that is increasingly anticompetitive. Most of the brand names we consume, particularly in the West, come from big corporations owned by a small number of elite families or close associates. We see this in such sectors as Big Oil, Big Mining, Big Banking, Big Pharma, Big Agriculture etc. We also see the parallel trend of capitalist markets seeking infinite growth through expanding GDP on the basis of limited resources, otherwise known as globalization, but without concern for GDP per capita or individual well-being.\n\nCombine this increasing monopolization of the world’s wealth in the hands of the few with the infinite growth policy of neoliberalism and you get late-stage monopoly capitalism, the massive and ceaseless accumulation of wealth by a small number of corporations (monopolies and oligopolies) without regard for earth’s resources. Because of their wealth and influence, these corporations then go on to \"capture\" government institutions. They use their control of government to expand market access. This gives us corporatocracy, de facto rule by corporations.\n\nIt shouldn’t be hard to see that increasing monopolization and infinite growth are unsustainable late-stage monopoly capitalist tendencies. Eventually people will be so poor they won’t be able to afford your products and there’ll be no more resources to exploit because of ecological depletion and/or catastrophe.\n\nSo does anyone think the capitalists will come up with something to save capitalism, like maybe forcing everyone to live under a neofeudalist, social credit type of system to ensure people keep buying their products or embrace harsh Malthusian measures to prevent ecological collapse in order to keep producing? Or is the system ultimately doomed to failure because of its internal contradictions?  Is late-stage monopoly capitalism capitalism's last gasp?",

  "selftext": "First, I'd like to say that I am not ideologically attached to markets and property, but I do consider myself a sort of (limited) market socialist in terms of what we could realistically expect to emerge in an anarchist society. There is one claim made by marginalist economics that I can't get over, and it is the so-called \"socialist calculation problem\", which I rephrase thus:\n\n1. A functioning society requires knowledge about what is needed where, and how much, and when, and of what kind, for a given economic goal.\n\n2. A currency that conveys economic data, allowing for the distinction between types of labor and the value of materials as applied to the production of different goods and services, is the best (most efficient) solution to this problem.\n\n3. That economic data is derived primarily by comparing the relative values of goods and services (which is to say through exchange).\n\nI am aware that markets under capitalism aren't actually nearly as efficient as capitalists claim, and it may just be that without capitalism, there would be such abundance that the question of \"efficiency\" becomes insignificant. But I don't think that is sufficient for a society without a mechanism for *suppressing* the emergence of currency to be expected to operate without one for long. If currency exchange does prove more efficient than other methods of allocation, then in an anarchist society, there will be currency and exchange based upon it. Not because of competition on the basis of efficiency, but because communities will naturally seek out the best way to meet their needs.\n\nI decided to post this here rather than in the debate sub because I am not hostile to Communism as a goal. I am merely skeptical that it is in fact the economic modality that people would, by and large, be most likely to choose.",

I explained it to her, along with my strong feelings about it and why I felt that way. Then she asked, \"what about mass murderers?\" I responded by saying exile or death, which I understand sounds a bit like [that batman line](https://youtu.be/QswquD2sDUw?si=DS_231wu7DsXa5ja).\n\nI firmly believe that most people deserve second chances, however I also think there are some things you can't come back from. After you cross a certain point you cannot ever be accepted into society again. For instance, when I was in the ME I spoke to a man whose community had been terrorized by ISIS, they'd take people to the tops of the towers at a nearby plant and push them off while their families were forced to watch. The fall didn't always kill them and anyone who tried to help the victim would be shot or pushed off themselves.\n\nIn my mind, the people who perpetrated this don't deserve a second chance and, although I think exile is an alternative, I worry that exile would risk them coming back or terrorizing someone else. Maybe I'm wrong here, in fact I'm sure there are many people who think I am, but I see no other way.\n\nMurderers, rapists, even pedophiles. Rehabilitate them. Mass murderers, serial rapists, terrorists (this last depending on the situation).

A single violin player is his own conductor; an orchestra requires a separate one. The work of directing, superintending, and adjusting, becomes one of the functions of capital, from the moment that the labour under the control of capital, becomes co-operative. Once a function of capital, it acquires special characteristics.\n\n— Capital, Vol. I\n\nAll combined labour on a large scale, says Marx, requires a directing authority. Under capitalism, this directing authority is the capitalist.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nMarx later wrote:\n\n>**The co-operative factories run by workers themselves are, within the old form, the first examples of the emergence of a new form**, even though they naturally reproduce in all cases, in their present organization, all the defects of the existing system, and must reproduce them. **But the opposition between capital and labour is abolished there, even if at first only in the form that the workers in association become their own capitalists, i.e., they use the means of production to valorise their labour.** These factories show how, at a certain stage of development of the material forces of production, and of the social forms of production corresponding to them, a new mode of production develops and is formed naturally out of the old.\n\n— Capital, Vol. III\n\nThe workers become their own capitalists under the new form of production i.e. each one becomes their own \"directing authority\" in charge of \"directing, superintending and adjusting\" the valorisation of their own labour. In other words, the abolition of the opposition between capital and labour means, at least at first, the abolition of hierarchical relations between capitalist and worker. This is because all come to own the product of their own labour.\n\nMarx says that capitalism \"not only subjects the previously independent worker to the discipline and command of capital, **but creates in addition a hierarchical structure amongst the workers themselves**\" (Capital, Vol. I). In the new production form of the co-operative, this hierarchical structure disappears and the worker's independence is restored.\n\nThis doesn't excuse Marx's authoritarian tendencies; he was no anarchist after all, even though he became more libertarian with age. However, it does show that Marx also shared the anarchist goal of eliminating all hierarchies. Thoughts?",

Now, I assume we could make our system have rules and still have it qualify as anarchistic; what I'm less sure about is whether our system could have rules that specify penalties for breaking other rules and still have it qualify as anarchistic.\n\nSuppose we're considering putting in the following two rules into our scheme of cooperation: '1. don't perform action X, and 2. if you do perform X, then you have to endure punishment Y.'  My question is: would rule 2. be compatible with the system being anarchist in nature?\n\nIf it would be, would it be compatible in the  sense that, if I join the system with both rules and break rule 1., others members can rightfully enforce rule 2. by making sure I endure punishment Y? Or would it be compatible in the sense that, upon breaking rule 1., I’m given the option of either staying in the group and voluntarily enduring punishment Y, or leaving the group?  \n\nThe first option seems more in line with anarchism to me, since forcing someone to endure a punishment they are actively rejecting is coercive - but then again, it's not as if having the option of staying in a system of cooperation that one depends upon for survival and enduring a punishment, or leaving said system and risking death, is a scenario where you can make a completely fee choice either.\n\nAny help understanding would be greatly appreciated!",

I don’t know a ton about Anarchism but I’m always trying to learn more about the world. \n\nEspecially seeing the glaring social problems in America and feeling like “voting the wrong people out” isn’t ever going to fix the problem. To my understanding, state violence, greed, and conservatism are essentially ingrained into the very essence of America itself. They’re not bugs, they’re features. \n\nSimulation and Simulacra has become a flavor-of-the-month book for many amateur philosophy fans [that’s me]. Here is a link to an article explaining the Postmodernist Jean Baudrillard on why he doesn’t like Scientism.\n\nhttps://cyberartsweb.org/cpace/theory/baudrillard/white5.html\n\nI like some Slavoj Zizek interviews. Now to my understanding, Noam Chomsky and Zizek vehemently disagree on Postmodernism, with the former considering it to be a sort of empty bourgeois intellectual endeavor. \n\nI’ve tried to read Derrida and Foucault and sometimes I think it gets a bet heady and cerebral and hard to understand. \n\nBut my two cents is: Western scholarship places a big emphasis on “academic intelligence.” Sometimes I think we neglect local knowledge. For instance, I have a lot of midwives in my family tree and to be a midwife it takes local knowledge. \n\nAlso I think zoos and museums have the potential to be bad things. It’s almost a display of arrogance that we put animals in cages and throw wine-and-cheese parties where benefactors can give money to a zoo and get a fancy plaque and feel better about themselves. \n\nOne inherent danger in a museum is that the ethos that’s built into our social estimation of museums can lead people to believe something simply because “they saw it in a museum.”\n\nAnywho… do you think Postmodernism and it’s’ critique of Scientism holds any water?

True, the current capitalist system may not survive but it's adapted to extreme situations many times in the past and may very well end up adapting once again instead of dying out- similarly, the collapse of liberal democratic systems is just as likely to lend itself to warlords seizing power in open despotism or the reinstitution of a feudal system as it is to any form of anarchic system. \n\nOn top of that, I worry that we may end up in a sort of state that the Situationists were wary of, albeit for different reasons: that the harsher environment will make us so focused on survival that we lose the ability to live, that we won't be able to hold any aspirations beyond just getting by for one more day and ultimately lose the ability to even hope for anything more.

For example, it seems to have largely abandoned the \"peaceful rise\". Part of this is no doubt due ti western antagonism to a new rising power, but there's definetly internal politics at play as well. Plus, we see a rise of a new personality cult unlike anything since Mao. Deng, though very much an authoritarian wasn't Mao and didn't have a comparable personality cult. Deng was definetly no democrat (see a certain square in bejing), and neither is Xi. So I am wondering what kind of internal political and internal changes have happened in the PRC between the Deng and Xi that has led to this broader shift in Chinese politics. How has China changed between the two? Are the fundamental dynamics of the state different under Xi than Deng? A lot of the PRC's legitimacy rests on maintaining social stability, so I was wondering if China's rapid industrialization but slowing economy is playing a role in this shift in power politics.\n\nOr we can look at Xi's covid response (in particular the disaster in Shenzen) and how that has influenced internal dissidents. \n\nWhat are some good libertarian analysis of recent changes in a post-mao, post-deng China? I would particularly love a libertarian analysis of Xi's premiership in particular. \n\nHow should we as libertarian socialists approach these changes and are there ways a genuinely liberatory movement can capitalize on these internal changes within China?

Below is additional background information. Feel free to read it or skip it.\n\n\\-------\n\n[Graeber defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs) a BS job as \"a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessry, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is the case.\"\n\nIn the audiobook, the first time I heard Graeber mentioning IT work as a BS job was a part where he did not elaborate on why. Later in the audiobook, he mentioned IT firms as being full of BS jobs. With regard to IT firms in particular, I believe I heard him say they are full of lots of unnecessary paperwork.\n\nI am teacher, so I do not know much about IT firms. We do, however, have an IT director and at least one rank-and-file IT worker at our school. Several of my colleagues and I regard the rank-and-file IT worker as making useful contributions (I explain more in [this Anarchy101 comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchy101/comments/jv9wqh/comment/jdm7kcz/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which, by the way, is a small part of great conversation about IT work in general).\n\nThe book says that teaching is not a BS job, so perhaps work directly supporting teachers would not be BS, either. (Especially if the role could give someone opportunities to make contributions to rank-and-file education workers' efforts to unite against management, as I mention in the comment linked above.)\n\nOn the other hand, the books says a job is BS if it solves a problem that should not exist in the first place. Lois Weiner writes that most of today's educational technology is pernicious and that it alienates and disempowers students and teachers. I don't really know how the IT workers at our school spend most of their time, and there's a chance only a fraction of it involves helping teachers solve problems that actually need to be solved. If someone told me IT workers at schools spend most of their time upgrading things that do not really need to be upgraded (for instance, things that would not need as much upgrading if the school were using open source hardware and software), I would be very open to considering that viewpoint. Maybe, if my school used free and open source software and hardware, the students and teachers could derive meaningful learning from exploring how it works themselves, so perhaps IT workers don't really need to be \"helping\" by fixing all the router and display and software problems caused by unnecessary purchases and proprietary software upgrades?\n\nEdit: I fixed a typo, added a link, and added one sentence at the end.",

If democratic self managed workplaces and community councils federated together a on regional basis and then on a national basis how is that any different from what I as a socialist mean when I call for industrial democracy, workplace committees, local community ownership and a democratic republic? \n\nIf it's a \"free federation\" would that mean local communities would have the right to secede from the federation? How would this work if an important economic region just decided they wanted to go their own way - or what if areas wanted to establish their own ethno-state and secede from the federation in order to implement racist laws? How would this be dealt with without a national or international monopoly on force to force the municipalities/communes/territories to abide by certain laws or face the consequences?",

  "selftext": "Looking through this subreddit, I have seen multiple people say that anarchists oppose all authority. However. I have read some sections of the Anarchist FAQ, and in section H.4, it says\n> The first fallacy in Engels account is that anarchists, as we indicated in section B.1, do not oppose all forms of authority. Bakunin was extremely clear on this issue and differentiated between types of authority, of which he opposed only certain kinds.\n\nThis is confusing for me, as I don't know who to listen to about what authority is. I understand that expertise, organization, and force are not authority, and I would say I have a decent understanding of anarchist theory. I've read all the basic anarchist texts, including *What Is Authority?* but nothing has answered this one question of mine. \n\nWhat is authority?\n\nEdit:\nI have tried to create a functional definition of authority from Errico Malatesta's *Anarchy* \n\n> “In short, the governors are those who have the power, to a greater or lesser degree, to make use of the social power, that is of the physical, intellectual and economic power of the whole community, in order to oblige everybody to carry out their wishes. And this power, in our opinion, constitutes the principle of government, of authority.” (Malatesta, 6) \n\nHe equates the principle of government and the principle of authority, so while talking about governors, his statements here apply just as well to authority-holders. The governors have the power to use \"the social power\" and can oblige others to carry out their wishes. This necessitates a hierarchy and the usage of force. \n\nFrom this, the definition of authority that I have made is, \"A role within a hierarchy that gives the power or right to give orders and make decisions for others while enforcing obedience by coercion or threat of coercion. Is this a good definition?",

This is mainly for two reasons:\n\n1) I feel like we are too dependent on the (oppressive) systems we live in and some of us are more than others.\n\n2) Most people are not anarchists, nor socialists and too often straight up fascists\n\nSo let's hypothetically say people go for some sort of revolution. Because of 1) this would damage a lot of people, which would not join because of that. For example, as a trans woman, I would really be reluctant renouncing my hrt medications which would most likely happen for a long time as a result. Also because of 2) I can imagine the revolution resulting easily in an authoritative state as a response or at least in the formation of dangerous non-anarchic groups what would continuously endanger the community. Maybe 2) could be overcome by really convincing most people before such a revolution occurs, but how can you contrast the \"mainstream\" propaganda and indoctrination we are subjected to from our birth? Most people laugh at the most basic anarchic ideas.\n\nBut without a revolution how would that happen? I can hardly imagine the destruction of such systems \"from within\".",

  "selftext": "Hi! I was reading An Anarchist FAQ, and I have some questions about the functioning of the economy in anarchism. Sorry if I'm misunderstanding anything.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  What would happen to the assets of closed-down collectives?   \nLike if say some factories and shops will have to be closed down because of a large drop in demand, or a miscalculated investment resulting in massive overproduction, or some other such crisis, big enough that they can't just reduce hours, and some factories and shops will have to close. What would happen to the assets afterwards?  \nIn Mutualism,\\* it seems simple to me, because it would be a lot like the situation of the Mondragon Coop in 2013, when one of the members, FAGOR, was closed because there just wasn't much demand in the market during the recession, and they kept running at a loss, so the general assembly voted to deny FAGOR more credit and let it go bankrupt because they feared that it would drag the whole federation down with it from the sheer expense. The workers were helped by the federation, with early retirement pay, relocation to other coops, etc, while FAGOR's assets were sold off to other companies to pay off it's debt to the Caja Laboral credit union. Under Mutualism, unless something is very different, I would assume that it would be a similar process unless the confederation votes to do something different with the assets. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.)  \nBut in Anarchist Communism and Collectivism,\\*\\* the assets are the property of all of society, not owned just by the workers who work there, so how would the assets be dealt with? Would they just be divvied up to other collectives that the confederation decides needs them?  \n\n2. How would economic planning be done in anarchist societies?  \n(This one's not about the Mutualists BTW.)  \nI've read *FAQ*, and as I understand it, economic planning in an anarchist society basically consists of trying to collect information about demand (whether it be through councils of economy, or communes, statistical commissions, etc), and then the confederations of collectives will try and plan out the investments to different collectives to try and meet the needs of the people. But then the collectives act autonomously, trading with each other freely, without the sort of Soviet-style commands, ie: \"*You will get 10 tons of coal from company A, and 40 tons of Iron Ore from company B, and you will produce 30 tons of Iron to sell to company C...\"*  \nIt's not like that at all right? They plan out the investments, (either in labor notes, or directly with labor and raw materials), and then from there on out, they interact autonomously, doing whatever they need to, as long as they try and fulfill the plan.  \nAm I understanding things correctly?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Yes, I know Mutualism doesn't mean \"Market Anarchism,\" that it just means \"Anarchism tolerant of markets,\" but I'm talking about a Mutualist coop that is operating in a market here, so just humor me for a moment please. You don't need to explain it to me again.\n\n\\*\\*I'm using Collectivism here because I saw it in *FAQ.* I understand that it's not really popular at all in anarchism today, so can anyone explain why Iain Mckay is using it there, and why he explains stuff like investment funds and the like in such detail? Is it still popular in some form, or is it part of a sort of Malatesta-style \"there will be a mix of systems at first,\" sort of thing going on here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks!",

We shared many other things in common and liked to spend time together regardless, and until recently things were going super well. \n\nEvery so often though, we'd find ourselves in a conversation that revealed some of our respective fundamental beliefs, which didn't always match up for us. We managed to move forward, without debating each other too deeply, because we were still quite fond of each other and were both enjoying the relationship on other levels.\n\nWe spent some time discussing a potential \"future\" together periodically, along the lines of combining our lives, cohabitating, etc.\n\nSo tonight, we were hanging out, just chatting, and they mentioned having read \"some\" of the anarchist literature I gave them. Here's where it gets real.\n\nThey basically dismissed anarchism in general as a belief system for people who wanted to do nothing more than complain about everything and not take any responsibility for their own lives. In other words, the resistance to the system was just a failure to do what is necessary to make one's life better.\n\nI honestly had no words. We sat watching telly for a while after, and then at some point I just began to sob. I got up and left.\n\nI feel like this relationship is over, honestly. I don't know how I can even begin addressing their comments since it felt like they must've known it would most certainly be taken as a judgement on me and my worldview.",

Covid-19 has exacerbated inequalities and the popular perception of crime (rightly or wrongly) sees it as on the rise again, with homicide and other violent crimes still above pre-Covid levels. Obviously many people have been fed up with the uselessness of police forces and some have taken up action as costumed characters straight from a comic book that I would and still love to read. They have done things from helping to provide shelter to those at risk, opening up soup kitchens, helping to keep neighborhood watch for crime, and a little more than occasionally trying to take matters into their own hands. \n\nThat said, has there been any thought given to this movement by anarchists?

The total income of the worker is w, i.e. the wage. And the distulity of labor is going to be z. P is units of production.\n\nThe more a worker produces, the higher the disutility of labor, it's a lot more pleasant to work for your first hour rather than the 10th.\n\nOk, so the worker will continue working until one of the following two conditions is met:\n\nw=c (at which point the worker has achieved their desired level of consumption and it is no longer rational for them to keep working)\n\nor\n\ndw/dp = dz/dp  (i.e. the change in wage is equal to the change in disutility. At this point, it is rational to stop working because the cost of labor, it's disutility, is higher than the reward and so it's not rational to keep working).\n\n\nA worker will always set c <= x (where x represents the level of production corresponding with the point where dw/dp = dz/dp) because it is not rational to have c be greater than x (after all, that means that the desired rewards are greater than the cost of attaining them).\n\n\nIs this analysis correct?\n\nEdit:\n\nMinor correction",

  "selftext": "I used to be an Ancap years ago, but I never really agreed with most of their points. For example, they are really conservatives; some of them have hatred towards progressive things like feminism. They are not against hierarchies at all, just the state and authoritarian violence like the police or the army. But at the same time, a small amount of them seem to me like just people who want freedom of trade. I know there is no freedom in capitalism, and they simply don't seem to understand that. Capitalism is not equal to free trade, and I understand the problems with private property. I am working on a theory for a free-market, non-capitalist anarchist society where I try to reconcile the \"good things\" about capitalism. (Please note, I am not trying to defend it, but I am trying to create something that can attract people to our side, I like to talk and debate, not close myself off in my viewpoints because that made me an Ancap for many years and led me to argue with my socialist friends just because I was a naive and arrogant teenager who always thought I was right).  \nI appreciate aspects of capitalism, such as the variety of services and products, and I don't feel that getting rich is inherently wrong. People have different priorities in life, as long as this wealth doesn't give them power over others as capitalism does in our society, creating poverty and coercion. I like the ideas of cooperative companies, and I no longer agree with private property. I genuinely think that claiming a system is superior just because you have the freedom to not pay for Netflix, while ignoring all the problems like social inequalities, bigotry, monopolies, and control over people's abilities that capitalism brings, is kind of weird.  \nHowever, I believe that some reasonable Ancaps and some regular capitalist individuals would agree with a market-based anarchy. I live in Brazil, and people who don't align with leftist points of view often think it's some kind of poverty vote, limiting your own path and obtaining your things. They might also perceive it as an authoritarian point of view where others just want to take your stuff and dictate your life. I really doubt that this is the point. Anarchy is against authority, and if we show that people could create their own paths and have control over their lives without an elite figure controlling us over the economy or using violence, they would agree with us. Most people have the same beliefs; they are just misguided. Can we find a common point of view that can make people unite instead of continuing to fight while the world keeps getting destroyed by those in power?  \nI am new to politics and anarchism. I was watching Second Thought, and he mentioned that a socialist society would have markets and other types of economies, like a degrowth economy. However, he was talking from a government-based socialist perspective. But what do you guys think about this? These are just some questions that I would like people to explain and talk about here. I am not trying to support something or convince anyone. If that's what it seemed like, it was not my intention. I just want to understand if I am missing something. Thanks for reading anyway:)",

We strive to create resilient and self-sustaining systems that promote biodiversity, enhance soil fertility, conserve water resources and avoid harmful waste while harmoniously integrating landscapes, ecosystems, and human settlements.\n\n###FOR Peace and non-violent resolution to conflicts\nWe advocate for non-violent strategies that address social issues and create lasting positive change, as opposed to governments and organizations imposing their will by militarised intervention. \n\n###AGAINST Discrimination and inequality\nWe aim to dismantle discrimination and inequality in all its forms, including systemic racism and queerphobia.\nWe aim for a society that recognizes and celebrates the diversity of human experiences, irrespective of their race or ethnicity, gender identity or sexual preference.\nWe strive to address the historical and ongoing impacts of racism and racist structures, and uplift marginalized communities.\nWe also envision a world where the word “queer” becomes meaningless because individuals are not defined or limited by the concepts of gender or sexuality, and where everyone can freely express their authentic selves.\n\n###AGAINST Animal exploitation\nWe embrace a compassionate approach to our relationship with animals, recognizing the inherent value and welfare of all sentient beings. We strive to build a more harmonious coexistence between humans and animals, promoting sustainable and cruelty-free practices that benefit both the planet and its inhabitants. This commitment reflects our deep understanding of the interconnectedness of all living beings.\n\n###AGAINST Imperialism, both in its traditional colonialist form and in its modern politico-economic form\nWe stand in solidarity with indigenous peoples and support their right to self-determination, land sovereignty, and cultural preservation.\nWe challenge global systems that exploit and subjugate nations and communities politically and economically, by exploiting the workforce and natural resources and transferring profits out of the region.\n\n----\n\n###My questions to the community:\n* @ fellow anarchists: would you agree with these values?\n* @ undecided/curious passers-by: do any of these points come as a surprise to you?",

  "selftext": "I've always considered myself as an anarchist, but only on an individual or tight knit community scale partially because the system of oppression is very large and I am very small. I understand the notions of mutual aid and deconstruction of power imbalances thru either the means of revolution or evolution but when it comes to big picture conversations I'm a bit confused and have a few questions. \n\nBorders- I'm American but I'm aware that national borders can be open ended as many European borders where one can roam freely and might just need a passport or ID. This is normal. But if there was an anarchist social structure to take the place where the US once stood I can only assume that the borders would remain. So how would we maintain or negate certain boundaries between an anarchist structure and a nation that has conflicting policies. Would we even be considered a country in their eyes? (It would be super cool if both Mexico and Canada were chill about lax borders but I know that our borders also extend to the oceans and skies for defense, trade and travel)  \n\nNational Security- I've always hated the military state entirely I detest it, but the problem remains that there are going to be nations with conflict of interest, or nations that might even view the rebuilding of an anarchist society as a power vacuum (especially if the transfer of power is violent or extremely sudden) to exploit? \n\nLarge scale governing- I would assume that it would be democratic, hopefully with an informed and educated voter population with actual weight to the polls but how would we keep national affairs transparent? The only thing I can think of is live broadcasting but that might be unnerving or dangerous when it comes to decisions on foreign policy. If the system decides on some sort of overall democratic mediation what would be the deciding factors? How to we keep conversations on international and interior issues in the hands of the people while also keeping open a direct line of communication for movement, be that defense or aid? \n\nThank you for reading up to this point. I'm aware that a lot of these questions sound like republican talking points about a country's \"weakness\" and the idealist in me wants to ignore it but I've never had the republican talking points legitimately answered. So devils advocate for the sake of genuine need to understand the concept better.",

  "selftext": "Ok, so first off, I want to say I'm pretty new to anarchism in general *and* this is the first time I am posting on reddit at all. and I mostly made account because I was curious to get answers to a few questions or I suppose some viewpoints? My title kinda sucks and I apologize if it doesn't reflect what I'm saying here super well. Also I hope this was the right sub to post this too...\n\nSomehow, I ended up down Anarcho Primitivism rabbit hole as it were. So, I guess I am kind of asking about critiques of anprim and will apologize in advanced because I know this is something that has gotten brought up multiple times across the anarchy subs and I'm sure some may be sick of seeing it when it comes up.  I know this is a controversial type of anarchy if I'm not mistaken so what I'm about to say is not intended as a jab to the community. It's made me somewhat depressed in a way, and by that, I mean, I'm a person who enjoys reading and painting and the like and wanting to learn about permaculture I've even considered becoming vegan, and I have come across some viewpoints in this realm that make me feel incredibly guilty for liking these things because I guess they technically shouldn't exist? I feel sort of stuck and I'm not really sure how to feel about this or even what to do with myself if my hobbies are considered to be unnatural. Again, this is not me trying to bash this form of anarchism. Books are a big part of my life and it has sort of made me lose interest in reading or anything and kind of wanting to get rid of all my books and even my art supplies.\n\nI also don't know how I feel about agriculture anymore, or maybe a better way to put it would be growing our own food. I was pretty interested in permaculture, as I already mentioned, but there seems to be a controversy over that as well. Can we make food cultivation sustainable? Or is this just not possible?  And I'm not going to lie that, yes I do enjoy the internet and other forms of technology, whilst I do understand it's not exactly sustainable and I always wonder if it's possible to keep any of it around in any capacity, or again, this is just not realistic? I've read the main pushbacks from other anarchists against anprim and the responses from anprims to those arguments such as being ableist, homophobic/transphobic, the medicine issue etc. I just can't seem to wrap my head around this type of anarchy, I'd say I'm more aligned with stuff like the Youtuber Andrewism discusses, library economies etc. while understanding there isn't a perfect system.  I do obviously think we need to reconnect with nature, but does it really involve having to go back to the stone age or pre agriculture? I'm quite confused and not really sure on what to think. I know anprim is supposed to be a critique and I've mostly seen a lot of people agree with that notion. but many others seem to push back and say that it's the *only* way that is reasonable to live. Or some that say that yes, it is a critique, but they agree it's the only real way to live but they can't push it on you as that wouldn't follow what anarchism is supposed to be. I hope this makes some lick of sense, when it comes down to it, I'm just trying to look for some kind of clarity on this stuff. I guess there isn't necessarily one right way to be but there's definitely issues with the way civilization is and I absolutely agree with that. So, what exactly do we do? is there a real answer to this? Is primitivism the only real answer and should I give up hobbies? Perhaps that's too self-centered of a question. I fully believe in enjoying life but maybe the things I like aren't the right way to go about it. Once again, I apologize if this is just word vomit and I will be happy to elaborate on any points or questions I asked and please please please feel free to correct me on anything I have gotten wrong or made a mistake on, I don't want to come off as ignorant on anything or that I'm making assumptions.

  "selftext": "I am unaware of any gift economy historically that did not carry a notion of status with it that was directly tied to gifting. Ie, in the most widely known historical examples, Moka gift-giving and the Potlach, the giving of gifts (or in some forms of the Potlach, the destroying of one's wealth) was directly tied to status - the more you gave up, the poorer you became, but the more social status you gained. Obviously, this is not what Anarchism is - since, if there is a hierarchy of social status, there is inevitably a hierarchy of power.  \n  \nNote also the manner in which this mirrors the social status of charity today: many companies and wealthy individuals give substantial charity, not only for the tax benefits, but because it makes for good PR, a way to boost their social status in exchange for a small bit of their wealth. Anarchists tend to focus on mutual aid over charity precisely because mutual aid is *mutual* and thus does not directly create a shift in social status in that context. However, when dealing with gift economies, it seems that the drive would be toward imbalanced gifting in exchange for social standing, since there will always be more and less useful items exchanged. Ex, a person who gifts cool rocks to people is gifting something less valuable, in all senses, than a person who gifts people food, or clothing, or building materials.  \n  \nAre social status hierarchies not an issue for gift-economy Anarchists - and if not, why not? Is there something special about the gift-economy in an gift-based Anarchist society that precludes status hierarchy?

  "selftext": "So I had a great conversation with u/humanispherian the other day on r/mutualism about the cost principle.\n\nThey recommended I look into Equitable Commerce by Josiah Warren. I did, and I also found a great article on the cost principle on medium: [https://plutophrenia.medium.com/synopsis-of-the-cost-principle-46482793d505](https://plutophrenia.medium.com/synopsis-of-the-cost-principle-46482793d505)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne passage in this medium article made a lot of sense to me:\n\n>The Cost Principle demands a total restructuring of how a community deals with commerce. For value based commerce, supply is adjusted to the wants of the people based on the producers guessing how they can make the most money, that is to say, the fluctuating adaptations of supply to the demand. The constant guesswork on behalf of producers therefore produced enormous waste as excesses from production need to be disposed of. In cost based commerce, supply would be consciously adjusted to demand. People would communicate their wants, and production would follow accordingly. The Cost Principle would annihilate useless speculation. Although Warren didn’t have the terminology we are now purview to, what he is getting at is a primitive articulation of replacing the supply-push economy with a demand-pull one to accompany the Cost Principle.\n\nThis is obviously a better way of doing shit for a lot of reasons. 1) you get rid of useless speculation and waste. 2) you get rid of the incentive to artificially boost demand and to price gouge. In a supply-push economy you effectively are trying to sell as much of your inventory as you can. Any sudden surge in demand coupled with your limited supply means a higher price and higher rewards for you. That creates an incentive to surge demand. And that means that you have an incentive to do a lot of nefarious shit, from driving up fear or insecurities about looks, to funding misinformation and bullshit lies. If instead, demand comes first, and then supply follows, then you simply distribute the cost of production across more goods. The offloading of supply is a given because supply is determined by demand in the short run.\n\nSo I'd like to visualize the details on how a demand-push economy would actually work.\n\nBecause basically, for this to work, you need to know demand ahead of time, and then produce a supply accordingly. So how would that actually work? Would you like submit orders to a factory at the start of the month, they calculate how much material they need to in order to produce for that month, and then they split the cost of production evenly across their product? That makes sense to me.\n\nI suppose cost of production = material cost + wages for the month right? Josiah Warren's vision was the subjective cost of labor = wages.\n\nThat's fine and dandy.\n\nThe concern I have is as follows:\n\nLet's say we have a factory that can produce x products with its given workforce in a month. However, this month, demand is only for y products where y < x.\n\nWhat happens here?\n\nWell the cost of production will equal = material cost for y + wages.\n\nThe question is, how are wages determined?\n\nWell, Josiah warren suggested the subjective cost of labor. Since there is less labor needed this month, there's less subjective cost right?\n\nWell then, that means workers make less this month than they did before. Now they have an incentive to make sure that demand always meets x as this means that they get paid more. This creates the very problem I mentioned earlier, the nefarious attempts to artificially boost demand.\n\nAn alternative solution is that workers cost of living is covered as a form of wages, but then they're effectively wasting time when producing y products that could be used elsewhere. But what's the incentive to work elsewhere if they're getting paid the same regardless of labor? Furthermore, an interesting question opens up here. If we treat cost of living as fixed (stuff like housing, food, water, electricity, etc), then what can we say about discretionary income? Income that isn't needed but is used for fun or recreation? The obvious answer is the minimum needed to keep workers happy and keep them willing to return to work, but it's an interesting question of how that's determined.\n\nSo what's the solution here? I feel like it's a catch-22. You either pay the same every month and waste a lot of labor hours, or you pay according to subjective cost and then run the risk of under-capacity production creating an incentive to artificially boost demand.\n\nSee what I'm getting at?\n\nThe best solution I can see is that workers allocate their labor elsewhere in the case of under-capacity. They get paid the same and labor isn't wasted. But I'm not sure how that allocation would work? Like what do you do in that scenario?\n\nEdit:\n\nI realized my under capacity problem is basically a problem of supply push. I have a set number of labor hours in a month I am looking to offload.\n\n\nIf we treat the cost of labor as fixed: i.e. I need $m to maintain my lifestyle and be happy. The cost of that is going to be distributed over more or fewer goods depending on the production level.\n\nIf $m is too low I will move to another industry. If $m is too high, you attract more workers who are competed for fixed demand and that drives down wage to cost. Long term it evens out.\n\nIf you are in a high wage industry you have many competitors. In order to ensure your own high wages are met you can take a slightly lower one and attract all the customers. Sure your wage is lower but better than nothing right? Competitors must respond likewise until you reach the lowest wage you'll accept for the month. Personal subjective cost.\n\nYou could try and boost demand sure, but that doesn't solve the problem cause the issue is competitors not a lack of demand. Even if you boosted demand the same process would take place and boosting demand is rather expensive. You don't get more by producing more you just distribute higher production over more products. There's no real incentive to artificially boost demand \n\nShort term, there's no incentive to boost demand as demand is given before production and so you're not looking to offset a given supply. Supply is dependent on demand, not the other way around.",

  "selftext": "How does anarchism apply conflict resolution well? I feel like anarchism is extremely susceptible to outside influence and bad actors taking control if their will/wants/needs are not met. My worry is disagreements being blown up and things turning to shit. Of course, this is not to say capitalism does not have this happen as well. However, I would argue capitalism has many more safety mechanisms (i.e. power and authority) in place that can force resolutions whether they want it or not. Either through, again, force or through intentionally making people feel powerless and apathetic. \n\nWith anarchism essentially stripping these \"safeguards\" (again, safeguards for the people *in power*, \"speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far\") for conflict resolution, it becames a seemingly much more precarious and delicate situation. Where you need to essentially please everyone or things can go south. \n\nIn terms of a practical example, I would say things like infrastructure for travel and transport that maybe a local community doesn't want or agreements beween local communities going south. \n\nAnd so where my title comes into play is how compromise would look effectively in an anarchist world. Keeping people happy and understanding about how their needs cannot always be met. Because I think there are problems that are not exclusive or inherent to capitalism that can result in a \"systemic\" breakdown if not done well. And I don't know if I am convinced, but surely this could change, that having your voice at minimum being *heard* will always be good enough for everyone and there could be some rebuke or pushback that might be impossible to solve.\n\nI guess I'm just looking for reassurances or explanations that help remove these worries of fragility when power and authority are great tools for keeping people in check. Reworded differently, I know little about other mechanisms, outside of power and authority, that can be used as last ditch efforts to reach consensus when consensus cannot be reached.\n\nSorry, I'm rambling, maybe I can elaborate more after some comments.",
