The first two spoke about working and sport. The third said ‘I started at a new youth group’ to which I replied ‘which youth group is that?’ And he mentioned the church which is quite well known in our area. I responded by saying ‘I’ve heard that one is popular’ - this was no different to how I responded to the other  two boys mentioning sport/work ‘what club do you play for?’ Etc.\n\nThis morning I was pulled aside by a deputy who told me the librarian had complained I was speaking about religion with the students and asking me not to.\n\nI feel extremely embarrassed about the situation, especially as I myself am an atheist.

  "selftext": "Can we discuss this as a behaviour management strategy?  Where does everyone stand ? \n \nI was reading this article and I was very surprised and intrigued:\n\nWhy Redirection Is A Bad Classroom Management Strategy\nBy Michael Linsin\n\nRedirection as a classroom management strategy is common, accepted, and wholly uncontroversial.\n\nTouted from Baja to the Canadian Rockies and circumnavigating the civilized world, it's recommended de rigueur without a second thought.\n\n\"Just redirect\" they say, so easy and breezy.\n\nIt rolls off the tongue. It requires no explanation. And it really can get students back on track.\n\nSo what’s not to like?\n\nIt’s not accountability.\n\nWhenever you redirect misbehavior you ignore your classroom management plan. There is no other way to do it. Redirection always replaces what should be a consequence.\n\nTherefore, there is no accountability.\n\nYes, you can give a dirty look or raise your voice, which redirectors tend to do, but this isn’t fair and effective accountability. Further, it creates resentment and less intrinsic motivation to stay on track.\n\nIt makes you inconsistent.\n\nYou can’t have both a classroom management plan and use redirection. Technically you can, of course, but it will make you by definition inconsistent.\n\nY0u’ll have to choose, given the severity of misbehavior, whether to enforce a consequence or redirect. This will always result in disaster. Angry, confused students and chaos will be the norm.\n\nIt’s micromanagement.",

  "selftext": "Im a teacher from New Zealand and i am now starting my second year of teaching in Victoria. In 2023 I had a one term contract, which turned into a year contract, at a lovely catholic school teaching humanities and ethics. However this job was on the other side of town of where i ended up finding a home and in term four I accepted a job teaching VCE in my specialty area at an Independent school closer to home starting in 2024. There were some red flags in the interview but the salary offered was generous and my partner did not have full time work at the time. \n\nWhen I chose to leave NZ to teach in Aus, I was already considering leaving the profession due to high stress, burnout, and low  pay. My first year teaching in Australia restored my joy of teaching and remotivated.  However with this new job I feel like I'm having trauma flashbacks to the school that burnt me out (so badly I quit teaching and worked in a totally unrelated industry for 6 months before returning to the classroom)\n\n The new school is a series of red flags - higjly disorganised on all levels, over-bloated admin, terrible infrastructure (no water near office, no plug at my desk, tvs in classrooms not working) no one in management being able to answer questions about the school, very high staff turn over, taking on more students than there is space available in the school/in classrooms, and bad aggressive student behaviour that is not dealt with. Ive already had a student throw a phone and laptop accross a room - something I've not experienced yet in a classroom (but have heard other teachers complain about)\n\n Students pay over 35k a year to attend this school yet the level of disorganisation and building maintenance is so bad that it is on par with one of the most poverty stricken schools in Auckland (where I worked for 5 years and severely burnt out).  It just makes me very anxious which also affects my motivation. \n\nDo I quit and leave by the end of the term one and go into CRT untill I find a school or  something else to my preferences? \n\nOr do I stick it out for 2 terms? 4 terms? I'm just soo painfully aware of how much work there is to do for teaching the first year that it might be smarter to get out asap instead of sticking out the year and then doing it all over again somewhere else (or staying because i will fall into a suken cost fallacy and feel like ive put so much work in i cant leave) I also feel guilty that I won't be able to do the best by my students because I feel like I've been set up to fail and do not have the time to be a great teacher to my VCE students. \n\nI've already had a week of sleepless nights due to anxiety around the job and its only week 4 (we started the year early) \n\n\nIf any of you have any advice that would be greatly appreciated!! \n\nLastly I have never done CRT work but am very curious to try- if anyone has advice about this I would be very appreciataive.\n\nMany thanks in advance\nFrom a tiered anxious newbie xoxox",

I'm convinced that their social media /phone use, and the resultant effects on their sleep, attention span, memory/recall, social attitudes, general world-view, has caused this. My strategies over the years have largely revolved around building relationships where I can so that I can help kids get their head around a topic or, if need be, just getting them to attempt it in the hopes that we can make some gains. I don't think I can do that with these kids. Some ignore every bit of work, some seem terrified to attempt any work (NOT difficult work), some ask for assistance the second you finish explaining and literally ask me what to do the second I finish explaining it individually. They'll talk over me while I give instructions, chuck a tanty when reprimanded, then expect me to bend over backwards for them two seconds later. Most of the parents (even those who talk a good game) put nothing in place at home because they don't want the hassle (the kid who wrote 4 words before getting kicked out for constant swearing will still be out getting ripped with his mates tonight, heading to a party on Friday and fanging his bush bomb around on the weekend). My lower school classes look like heading the same way. I know part of the problem is me getting older and grumpier (at a rate of knots) and recalling how things were 'back in the day', but I don't see how this situation can be improved unless there's a massive recession that refocuses people on education, a massive reduction in social media use (never going to happen) and a resurgence of parental responsibility (not of the helicopter variety, but the 'raising responsible citizens' type).

I have a great school and great colleagues. \n\nHowever, I also have a history with anxiety. I was on medication for years but came off last year due to side effects. I was alright for a few months. But then I began randomly having panic attacks. It started during meetings or moments when it would be awkward to simply get up and walk around. It happened about once a fortnight. But as time went on, it got closer and closer together until this year. The week the students returned, I was having at least 1 panic attack everyday and on the Friday of week 1 I had one so bad and couldn't stop it and got sent home. \n\nI then experienced back to back panic attacks for several days and ended up going to the ER because I thought I was dying. I got put on medication for anxiety (Lexapro) about a week ago. I took week 2 off work while my body was adjusting to the medication.\n\nI tried to return to work on Monday but was so anxious I did not sleep at all the night before. I went to work and immediately burst into tears at the thought of being there. I took the students to assembly in the morning and spent the whole time trying not to throw up and run out. I ended up asking to leave at 1pm, lunch, because I just couldn't handle being there. \n\nI have taken yesterday and today off but my GP won't give me any more time off work. But I am absolutely dreading going back. I know that the best way to fight anxiety and panic is to face my fears but I can't exactly just stand in front of my 27 students crying everytime I start to panic. I do not feel capable of being their teacher at this moment. But I dont know what to do. \n\nI was told that acceptance is the first step to overcoming panic attacks. When I am anywhere else, I can calm down. But if I am in the classroom, I cant exactly just stop teaching and sit to do meditated breathing or grounding exercises. I can always ask the teachers near me to watch my class for 5 mins while I duck to the bathroom, but I have been having panic attacks for 20-30 mins. \n\nI have always enjoyed my job but something snapped a few weeks ago and it all feels completely overwhelming. Even the thought of parent meetings, swimming lessons, reporting, assessments, IEP meetings, etc... just feels like too much. \n\nI know the kids miss me and its not good for them to keep having a CRT everyday.

  "selftext": "What are some alternative jobs that I can go into with my teaching qualification that aren't teaching? I'm in my third year and I'm not loving it. I don't think I have ever loved it. I had one term where I enjoyed teaching and that was in a year 5/6 class where I had a one-term contract in term 4. The rest of the time I have felt incredibly frustrated. I feel every day like I am a bad teacher because I have 25 kids in my class and I am not able to meet all their needs at once. I feel like I am not good at managing the kids behaviour and I don't know if it's an issue with me or the kids or both- I can't put up with the eye rolling. backchat and overall rudeness until I retire. I do not like being screamed at when I ask a child to do something entirely reasonable like 'come here'. I feel that there is a problem with my behaviour management skills because I feel like if I was a 'better' or 'more effective' teacher the kids would behave. I keep being told 'be strict, be firm in your boundaries' but the stricter I am the more everything becomes a battle. 'Don't start teaching until the kids are silent' but then I will be waiting all day for the kids to be silent! I hate arguing with 9 year olds and letting them get to the top of me. At other schools I've had tables and chairs thrown and full class evacuations due to behaviour. I taught Kindy and I found that really challenging trying to get these kids to learn how to be at school, and learn some social skills. I went into year 3 feeling excited because the kids can read and write a little, and instead now I have nine year olds with the attitudes of teenagers. I resent terribly the amount of work I have to do in my own time- marking, reports, planning, parent teacher meetings. I often find myself thinking about how lovely it must be to have bathroom breaks whenever you need them, the freedom to take an afternoons annual leave to go and get your hair done etc. I dread Sundays, I don't sleep on a Sunday night. What other jobs could I go into? I spent 4 years at uni, I'm not particularly keen to do any more study. I like education but get me out of the classroom! Help! ",

Working Rural is isolating, and I needed to be back with family and friends. \n\nSigned up for classcover and I'm on many schools classcover lists. Emailed some schools I've worked at previously with no response back. So far, I've yet to get a casual day. I know it's only the start of the year, but I'm starting to get concerned.\n\nAm I doing something wrong? Should I be handing my resume to schools physically?",

And yes, I will take everyone's advice, and will go talk to a trusted adult about this.\n\nHowever to explain why I haven't. I was, and still am, worried about being brushed off and dismissed as just 'exaggerating things', because it had happened in the past. I understood before I posted this that this behaviour wasn't 100% ok, but didn't realise that it seemed as bad as what everyone is saying (Because he didn't physically do anything). I'm going to discuss with some classmates and perhaps file something in combination to support with more evidence and testimony. Thank you for your concern.\n\nCW: Potential sexual misconduct (?)\n\nI am in Victoria and have recently started my ¾ biology class and have a (M40-ish) biology teacher. Although he seemed ok at first, he soon started mentioning making what I would consider to be at the least weird comments, gestures, and questions. Things such mentioning sex, what seems unnecessarily much for an introductory topic about DNA (Gene expression, protein synthesis etc. Nothing really in the course about reproduction). Specifically mentioning our parents having to have sex to make us (the class), and sometimes insinuating things relating to the students as well. He also has a ‘gag’ of asking a question to a student, requiring a specific, (usually) one word answer. Then he would proceed to moan (?) at the response, getting increasingly sexual(?) in tone as he asked the student to repeat the phrase again. To making us remember it better is what I presume the purpose of it is.\n\nHe would eventually end either of these with something like ‘Oh I shouldn’t talk about these things at school’ or that he should ‘Go out more.’ This happens every other class, to most of his classes to my knowledge, but a fair bit more in my class especially.\n\nIt is somewhat known in the student body, or at least those who have taken his classes that he’s a bit creepy, at least to the older students. However, is not known to have physically done anything, nor pursued a private relationship with a student (at least still in the school)\n\nI have had past experiences surrounding grooming and SA, related to teachers, so I don’t know if I’m being too sensitive about this. I am unsure also that because he is a biology teacher, if this would be appropriate in the context of it being a biology class, alongside that he does not single out a particular student?\n\nI really don’t know if this is even misconduct or reportable behaviour and would not like to accuse anyone of wrongdoing when they have not done so.\n\n&#x200B;",

Is it normal for them to be modelling student behaviour to the point where they may as well be a student in your class?\n\n\nFor more context:\n\nThis seems like something I should've been made aware of at uni, but maybe they assumed everyone knew what LSAs were and their roles in the classroom.\n\nThe school I attended did not have in-clasroom LSAs.  I had heard of the concept, but never encountered an LSA until my teaching placements at uni. Even now, students in my class rarely get an LSA with them, even if they get one for other subjects, as Digital Tech isn't usually deemed important enough for it. All this to say, I am 4 years into my career (arguably 3, maybe 3.5 with Melbourne in lockdown for the first one), so my experience with what a learning support professional looks like in a classroom is limited.\n\nAs far as I can tell, this role is usually direct support of individual or a small group of kids with additional learning needs. In my limited experience, they are almost always helping students directly with clarification, redirection, and encouragement. I've seen great improvements in several of my students once they got the right support. Good stuff, sincerely grateful they're there.\n\nHowever. I have an LSA that seems to just... be acting as if they are also a student? They will take notes and complete the classwork, and ask questions on things they're interested in that are tangentially related to the content. At first I assumed they were modelling behaviour for the quiet students, but they have attended 3 of my different classes that covered the same content, and tried to continue the same threads of conversation they'd had with me previously, which would've made no sense to the students listening.\n\nNone of my students have learning plans that require someone else take their notes or anything like that. They very rarely interact directly with a student except for when supporting specific students that have defiance/refusal problems.\n\nFrom my point of view, it seems like they are doing precious little actual support for my students, and at times are even attempting to take my attention away from the students for their own gain.\n\nI plan on talking to our learning support leader regardless, because I have other qualms with this particular LSA, but I want to have a more concrete idea of whether I'm being reasonable when discussing this aspect of their behaviour; it would undermine what I'm sure are legitimate complaints to then comment on something completely normal. And tbh, it would reflect poorly on me to get something this basic so wrong this late in my career.\n\nSo: is this normal behaviour from someone in learning support?",

  "selftext": "1) last year was my 7th year and I had *that class* it was awful and hard and I’m still feeling fragile about it. \n\n2) this year so far, I don’t have *that class* but I’m finding myself so tired of all the processes and prep. I love my job but at the same time I can’t stand it. \n\n3) I can’t stand the way education is going: all the sharing of evidence and the tasks and rubrics having to be the same across grade groups. What if? I want to be creative? What if I want to do my own thing? Nope. Got to be the same as the other classes of my grade. Rationally I get it but it’s annoying I can’t just do my own thing.\n\n4) I can’t stand how much work it is and how heavy my class is with PLPs and IEPs this is not ANYTHING about the kids, it’s the damned extra paperwork. I’m tired of it, I’m tired of having to justify everything I do and I just want to shout BECAUSE IT WORKS as a reason instead of having to put jargon in. \n\n5) I hate breaking in new classes. It annoys me that I have to do the same things every damn year even in different ways it boils down to the same content. It’s so boring. I’m finding myself going crazy as I try and find the eighth new and creative way to tell my students to use the space and stuff correctly and be nice to each other! \n\n6) I’m sick of meetings. Grade team PLC, focus groups, staff meeting, can I get a damn break? I don’t want to be talked at. I don’t want to have to problem solve after a full day of work. I just. I don’t want to. It’s BS. \n\n7) ever changing/fad teaching styles and content for reading and spelling. In eight classes I’ve had, I’ve learned five different ways of teaching reading and spelling. None of it actually works outright for my kids and it’s so much work to adapt and justify why to nosy senior staff who can’t seem to accept that nothing is “one size fits all”\n\n8) I’m dreading having to go to work tomorrow. Not because of the kids but the literal everything else. I can’t do it anymore. Yet I ultimately can’t afford not to. I wish I could go back ten years and slap past me for choosing this career because I’m over it.\n\n9) I swear the actual teaching part is only 20% of my actual job.",

  "title": "Career change from healthcare to teaching",
  "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nAs the title suggests I'm looking to change careers from health to teaching through a masters. I believe that I am wanting the change for the right reasons, like having a genuine desire to help young people learn and enjoy being at school etc. I'm leaning towards primary, but I also have a passion for science that I wouldn't get to use as much compared to teaching secondary. I worry about the management of disrespectful teenagers.\nSo my question to everyone is, how is it being a late 20s teacher in secondary? Do you find the disrespect is for every teacher or more towards a certain type? Have you been able to build good relationships with those kids throughout the year? And how long does it take to get to the point of only teaching senior science?\n\nThen my question for primary teachers is how often do kids throw up? I don't handle that well at all. \n\nAlso if there's anyone on here who made the change to teaching from another career I'd love to hear how it went! \n\nThank you",

  "selftext": " \n\nI am a recent secondary education graduate in Victoria and I’ve just commenced an Agency-based CRT block at only one secondary school, 5 days a week for the duration of Term 1. I have only a little bit of CRT experience towards the end of last year, but this year, I have been diving into it head first, given I am staying at the same school for the term. \n\nI’m taking a year 10 class, that I and I only will be teaching for the term. I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to develop a unit plan and really put my own spin on the teaching, but alas, this hasn’t been the case.\n\nNothing for this class was left for me on the first day. I contacted the Daily Org and was told it would be updated, and it was, not by the class teacher but by the LAL. Students were to work through a workbook at their own pace with no explicit teaching. Ok, fine, I will just do my thing and chase it up after so I can start to develop a better plan for myself going forward. Lesson 2 rolls around, again, nothing, so I instructed the students to continue working through the workbook, asking for help if they need it.\n\nI spoke with the LAL and asked if there was a unit plan or anything that I could follow, and she told me there is nothing of the sort. I’m now going in to each lesson with no particular instruction and no resources given, for a class I’m expected to teach full time. I haven’t even been given any resources to be able to make my own unit plan if I wanted to. I had to even ask one of the students to email to me the workbook they were given, as it was never provided to me by the regular teacher. How can I be expected to provide the students with learning opportunities, when I’m not provided with teaching opportunities?\n\nI think at least one class daily is left with no instructional teaching notes, and I must contact the Daily Org to amend this for me, or come up with something on the fly. Probably half my classes have lesson plans, but they require access to digital textbooks or resources that I don’t have as a casual staff, and I can’t access them to show videos, provide explicit teaching etc. I have contacted the school but given that I am not a part of the permanent teaching staff, they can’t give me access to these things. I feel like half the time I’m teaching, I’m having to adapt and improvise the lessons because what I’m being given either doesn’t work or has no details. Is this normal? I’m providing feedback to the absent teacher for each class and having to explain that I had to adapt the lesson because the resources I was given didn’t work. I don’t want these teachers who I’m covering for to be upset or annoyed that this has happened. I want to provide positive feedback, and be seen as a reliable cover but the lesson plans I am being given just don’t allow me to do that.\n\nI feel like I’m contacting the Daily Org several times daily, because either very little or nothing is left for me. It’s starting to feel like I’m a burden for her, but I just want to be as prepared as possible for each class and I can’t always do that with what I am given.\n\nI’m wondering if it’s normal for CRT’s to experience this? What would a class teacher expect of me when I try my best to follow the plan but sometimes it just doesn’t work and it’s out of my control? What am I expected to do when things don’t go to plan?",

  "title": "Study suggestions for a HS humanities teacher looking to move into Design/Tech?",
  "selftext": "I'm a humanities teacher looking to re-train to teach design and technology, mainly wood and metal shop. I've always enjoyed working with my hands, figuring out solutions to real world problems, fixing things, etc, but was always pushed in an academic direction (which I'm fine at), but never got nearly the same satisfaction writing a paper as I did fixing or building something. Coupled with the things I find draining about teaching literacy heavy subjects (plagiarism/ChatGPT, marking load, that kind of thing) I think switching over to Design and Tech is going to be the more sustainable career for me in the long run. It also relates to a few of my hobbies and interests, and some of those skills might also be the start of a side business for me a bit later down the line. I've had the opportunity to shadow the shop teachers at my previous school and lend a hand where I could on my off periods, and it cemented it as a pathway I want to pursue.\n\nAt least in my area, new shop teachers are hard to come by and my school (generally a pretty desirable place to work) struggled to attract anyone when we had a vacancy, going through a couple guys on temporary certs who moved on to other things at the end of each year. I've never hurt for work even in the humanities, but there seems to be a real need/shortage for teachers in Design and Tech that isn't going to be filled anytime soon, as there's not a lot of overlap between \"good on the tools\" and \"willing to do a two year Master's by coursework with unpaid internships\". While it seems most people come to Design and Tech from industry and do the teaching certificate after, I'm in the unusual position of wanting to do it the other way around and was hoping for some advice.\n\nI had a look through ACARA for Years 7-10 and most of the academic content was reasonably familiar (I read... pretty broadly). The only significant theoretical knowledge gap I noticed there is the design process; if there are any books recommended or even a unit I could do online would be very keen to know! There is a unit I can do here, but I'm trying to avoid it as I'd much rather use that time/money to do something hands-on. \n\nAs far as skills, my goal is to teach secondary wood shop, possibly metal shop. I realise it may not be feasible to do that at the pretertiary level without having a good breadth and depth of experience, but it's definitely something I'd want to work towards eventually. I was hoping to get some recommendations on what units would be most valuable to an aspiring Design & Tech teacher, and which would be best learned in a classroom as opposed to self-taught. I have no formal training in any of this, basically just little pieces of everything:\n\n* very basic woodworking (no formal instruction) - honestly let's say \"none\" but very keen to learn more. I've used stuff like a table saw, drop saw, etc on personal projects and still have all my fingers. No experience with anything fancier than a butt join. \n* no real metal fabrication experience - definitely keen on this as well (welding as well as CNC)\n* some basic programming (C# with Arduino) - honestly not really as big a passion area for me but can be cool at times\n* 3D modelling in F360 (basic stuff like brackets and adapters) - I find this pretty relaxing actually, and relates to CNC\n* 3D printing (wrangling a tempremental Chinese printer)\n\nI'm currently overseas and should be able to start taking classes in August at the local TAFE equivalent. I'm not sure right now how many classes I'll have the time/budget for before I leave (coming back to Australia I plan to get right back into teaching, currently doing a lower-paying, lower stress job here so I can focus on other things), so I want to try and make the most of it. A quick summary of what's on offer:\n\nWoodworking: Intro, finishing wood, tablemaking, carcass construction, veneering and marquetry, forming and bending, wood CNC 1 and 2 (3-4 axis)\n\nMachining: lathe, mill, CAD/CAM, CNC mill\n\nMetal/welding: oxy-fuel joining, shielded metal arc, gas tungsten arc, gas metal arc, flux cored arc\n\nWould really appreciate any recommendations or advice! Books you've found helpful would also be great. By way of my own recommendation, if you're looking for a more \"big picture\" read on the \"why\" of vocational education, \"Shopclass as Soulcraft\" is great and is part of what got me considering this as a possible path.   \n",

We have had one PLT meeting, and I have been poring over all the resources and unit outlines available on Teams. But, I actually feel pretty underwhelmed about the amount of resources available and about the ambiguity around meeting certain learning criteria. It also seems like my Year 7s have a lot of time (several weeks of Term 1), to learn how to write a letter as their CAT task. As I am new to teaching, I was wondering, how do the Lead Teachers decide on the unit tasks? Are they just taking resources and ideas from those before them and aligning them with the curriculum objectives? To me the Curriculum has always seemed quite vague if I am being honest. And whilst I do enjoy the prospective freedom this offers, I am also concerned about it leaving a lot of room for error.   \nThere is a Unit Outline with some resources, and we are using a series of Mentor texts, but these are only supposed to be guided reading with annotations taking up 15-30 minutes of the lesson. Am I just to fill in the gaps with other activities that I think would qualify as independent practice? Realistically, how much \"practice\" do they really need to write a letter about themselves, I mean of course there are the usual peer edit review tasks etc. But I already felt like I was having to bring a lot of fluff and activities to the first week with no clear outline other than \"getting to know each other\", which was great for rapport. The kids seemed to enjoy it, but they are also chomping at the bit to learn, I have already implemented Independent reading (which was supposed to be this coming week) with their library books with no push back. \n\nI have had no real guidance at all to be honest, it has mostly felt like, just throw her in and she will learn how to swim. \n\nBasically, I just want to be a good teacher and I want the kids to be taught well and according to their abilities. But I am concerned about having too much time and what to fill it with, but there just doesn't seem to be the space to actually ask that.

I have degrees in science (Biology/Psychology) and Health so I do have a science-based education.\n\nBack in 2016 I had a massive nervous breakdown, for want of a better expression. I was burned out although I didn't realise it at the time, and I experienced major depressive episode for over a year. Needless to say, I did not get support from the exec at my school, and I left and initially went back to study.\n\nDue to unrelated circumstances, I decided to leave my most recent job in an entirely unrelated industry. I thought I could get a job teaching again and I was right, the shortage meant I did get a job at a K-10 school, as *a secondary Science teacher*.\n\nNow here is the panicky bit.

I am learning how to use Sentral and Google Classroom and Google Sites and stuff... we have books but \"nobody uses them\", students all have chrome books (except those rebels who \"don't\"), resources are online. Students are supposed to know how to use e-notebooks but I have yet to meet one among my four classes that admit that they can. So that's a challenge in itself.\n\nEven worse, though, is that I am essentially teaching outside my subject area. I have no idea what sort of pracs are even possible.

BUT she doesn't seem to grasp that I have very little idea of where to find things so that \"freedom\" is terrifying. I was initially told I'd be teaching two classes and doing IBR the other three lines and I was so down for that. Having to write entire courses for four different year levels, in subjects I have not done myself since I was in high school is just hecking impossible! I am in the stupid position of being more useless than teachers just out of uni, even though I can actually *teach*, because at least the new grads have used the electronic format while I never have.\n\nAnd just as the icing on the cake, I have arthritis in my knees and I have to go up and down two flights of stairs several times a day.\n\nI want out! I genuinely have no idea where to go now. Might it be possible to quit and just do CRT? Right now I am seriously considering just not turning up on Monday. I am beyond anxious, I can't settle to anything. I don't know what will snap first, my knees or my mind. ",

I am also now fully across all the shortcomings within the education sector, but is that in itself purely a reason to avoid teaching as a profession? I want to make a positive difference if possible but it also seems like a one way ticket to burnout / cynicism  \n\n\nWelcome anyone's feedback!",

  "selftext": "Hi team!\n\nI seem to keep clashing with our HOD of the inclusive education unit and my last post garnered great advice so I'm turning back to you guys for help.\n\nContext:\nI struggled in 2023 with one of my Year 9 music classes due to multiple reasons that are not crucial for context, however it prompted me to plan my class list for 2024 in advance so that those particular issues could be avoided. The HOD of inclusive education was on leave during the last few weeks of the year, so I set up a meeting with her replacement to discuss class allocations for the four Year 9 music classes of 2024. Together we allocated students requiring supports in carefully considered pairs that would thrive the best over three classes, and then then decided to place seven students with confirmed NCCD approved diagnosed learning support provisions into one class so that they can be supported by one Teacher Aide on that line of Year 9 classes to save resources. These students all have allocated funding through the NCCD scheme. I was assured that as I met the minimum requirement of 3 students with approved supports, I would definitely be assigned an aide.\n\nFlash forward to the end of Week 2 in 2024. I have been without a Teacher Aide for four lessons straight, and have just been advised after multiple inquiries that I will not be assigned one as there are other classes with \"more complex cases\" and my students are \"capable of participation in the subject\". As an alternative I have managed to bring in Clontarf staff (First Nations engagement program) to help so far for my lessons, however this is only a short term solution and not feasible to pursue. They have also only been present for less than half a lesson each time, and the difference in engagement, behaviour, and success in my students is like night and day. It is clear that without support, regardless of the qualification of the staff member, these students will not succeed.\n\nI am not sure if I am being shunted because it's music and it's either \"not academic\", \"not theoretical\" or not seniors, as it does not feel like equitable division of resources with what I've heard across faculties and I believe that the HOD does not understand what my subject actually entails and is making decisions off misconceptions. I have spoken with other teachers across the school and they are receiving TAs for much less students with far less complex needs. \n\nThe HOD is very difficult to communicate with, as she has diagnosed, well, support needs herself. The TAs have all seen my class list and are shocked that I have no one assigned, compared to other classes on that line. Today I had my most complex student leave class without permission to go for a 20min walk because he was feeling lost and overwhelmed and didn't want to disrupt the class, which was a miracle really that he was mature enough to do that.\n\nAny advice would be great. The needs of my students include two students with ASD, four with learning impairments (eg development at grade four level) and of course the expected ADD/ADHD throughout. I can provide more info if needed.\n\nThanks in advance x",

  "selftext": "Title pretty much says it. I’m a prospective secondary teacher, have been admitted into my MTeach course, but the people closest to me are all telling me not to do it.\n\nI’m 24 and I’ve wanted to be a teacher since I was in the last couple years of high school myself. Got a very high ATAR and took a couple of years off after finishing school basically out of paralysis because I felt I shouldn’t “waste” my grades on a low entry course, but couldn’t bring myself to do something like law or medicine either. Eventually started uni at 20, did a BA in English and History. I’ve just graduated that with a WAM of 85. Applied for the MTeach planning to teach in my major fields as well as languages once I get some official certification for these (I speak Italian and French). Since graduating uni I have found my family and husband have really cooled on the idea of me teaching, mostly citing concerns about the pay, the way the education sector is run and perceived in Australia, the lack of progression opportunities, and the low entry requirements for the MTeach. I find myself getting defensive of teaching every time I have a conversation about the career with them. I’ve been working as an educator in early childhood for the last 3 years and mostly enjoyed it. Some kids and parents have been difficult but I’ve found the work community at my school (pre-K to Yr 12) was pretty good, building relationships with both children and colleagues was rewarding and the aspects of teaching, planning and documenting were fulfilling and mostly worthwhile. It’s great to see a concept you’ve been working on bringing across just click with the kids in front of your eyes. I’ve always thought I would eventually teach high school, mostly as the students are more independent, you can have a bit more class conversation and banter, and you get to work within specific subject areas. People I’ve worked with in early childhood have said high school suits my personality and communication style and they could see me doing it.\n\nI understand my family’s legitimate concerns about teaching as a career in Australia right now. I just wanted to put the question to you guys as teachers, do I go for it and enrol in my MTeach classes or seriously forget the whole thing and invest myself in something else? Thanks for reading, it’s really appreciated :)",

Et voila: the tool will provide feedback.\n\nIf you have some time, I'd be very grateful for your feedback on it.\n\nI understand that your time is scarce so I truly appreciate your input and wish you all a good week!\n\n**PROTOTYPE:** [https://nex-pi.vercel.app/](https://nex-pi.vercel.app/)",

  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have an eight month old and I am returning to work this term in NSW. The babe is still exclusively breastfed (with additional meals). \nAs a breastfeeding mother, I am ‘entitled to a maximum of two paid lactation breaks of up to 30 minutes each per day’. These breaks are on top of the usual allocated breaks during the school day. My Principal approved me having access to the lactation breaks and referred me to a female Deputy Principal to iron out the details. \nToday I had a brief discussion about what adjustments could be made for my return to work and I did not receive a clear answer. I mentioned that a girlfriend at another school has been offered an hour off in the middle of the day to express. I also requested that if there isn’t something that is concrete, could I possibly not be placed on a playground duty (two 30 minute breaks) while breastfeeding which would ensure at least twice that I would be able to express. Both suggestions were not accepted.\n\nWhat I’m wondering is what agreement have other breastfeeding mothers made with their Executive team? Is this something I should put pressure onto lock in or something I should expect to fall into place once the term commences? \n\nThank you in advance for your thoughts and opinions.",

I'd love to start a thread about first day routines and classroom micro-routines!!\n\nHow do you 'nail' your first day routines and rules to set yourself and your class up for success when they come in? \n\nWhat micro-routines *(I can't think of the proper word for the little transitions)* do you think are failsafe (Example - When you are finished with your work, put it open in a pile \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ then get a familiar read and read quietly until the timer is up OR When you enter the classroom in the morning you unpack your drink bottle and any notes, bring it inside, go stand behind your chair OR You were absent yesterday, you go to the absent folder and get a note that you missed.).. Those little routines that just make your classroom *WORK* and flow smoothly*.*\n\nWhen going through rules. Do you first introduce yourself for the morning and then get straight into rules and expectations? I will have Year 1.. How pedantic do you have to be? I have never observed someone's first day...Do you just practise going inside and outside/lining up multiple times? Then move to the next thing once they've demonstrated it? \n\nI have heard my class (Year 1. YAY) are a bunch of firecrackers full of ABC soup of diagnoses. I am a very bright and bubbly person and I know I need to dull it down and be more firm and stern and get the routines down otherwise I feel they may be a bit wild. I want to set myself up for success!\n\nI have taught a few years now but the first day is always nerve wracking and everyone collaborating on little things that just work and make the classroom flow!  \n\nThanks!!

In addition to that, I also start work next year, so financially I'd be earning more earlier with RMIT. Unimelb offers me no scholarship however I get the the name. Comparing the course structures of unimelb and RMIT, unimelb(as well as pretty much every other uni) requires you to do learning area subjects as part of your coursework for whatever teaching area you want to get into. In RMIT they don't seem to have this as part of their coursework, but rather the method area subjects seem to be quite general. I am worried that I might be missing out on important tailored subject-specific information at RMIT. \n\nSo my questions are: \n\n1.  To all the people who have done their degrees is were those learning method subjects quite useful and indispensable for you as you begun your initial teaching career. \n2. To all the teachers here, does going to Unimelb help me get into teacher positions at schools easier? Like would I be able to get into private and catholic schools easier as compared to RMIT? And what about career growth; would that be more rapid if I go to unimelb ( like administrative positions, leading teacher etc.) ?\n\n Your replies will help me a lot in choosing between the two unis.

  "selftext": "Please excuse any typos but I’m mad, and my iPad is old. I’m really frustrated at myself because, I tried to promise myself I would only do the bare minimum this holiday period, for example:\n\n1. I’d plan my first days back.\n2. I’d gather resources online and book mark them as I see them (eg. On reddit, on Facebook etc) \n3. I’d read my IEP and PLP doc and make sure I’m up-to-date on what I need to make the first couple of days run well and know what might be a trigger for those children\n4. I’d make the student labels for the tubs and lockers etc.\n5. I’d go pull the furniture into position after the classroom carpets were done to save having to do them the day before school starts. \n\nThe rest is so in the days leading up to term that we get to prep. And I enjoyed my holiday literally the bare minimum. \n\nTurns out though? The bare minimum is now going to take a lot more time than I expected. I went onsite Sunday (had permission!) to pull everything out of storage now the carpets are dry. \n\nThen I sat down in a heap and cried because my tub labels that I had last year are ruined (looks like my stuff may have been rained on outside while they were cleaning the carpets maybe?) so I have to find time to reprint, laminate, etc. it looks like the water seeped into the lamination somehow.  Could also have been just cleaning products maybe? Idk but they’re ruined. \n\nThey took down the material I’d put up on the pinboards (for what reason I d k because the boards weren’t cleaned?), so now I have to staple all that up. If we were getting them cleaned I feel like we should have been told because now the big piece has holes in it where it was pulled off roughly and torn. So I’ll probably have to replace that. \n\nSome of my furniture is missing? Like… not in the room where I left it? So I’m wondering who took it and when (we all get certain items by default like say 2 long book cases and two tote trolleys etc.) so now I have to email admin and find out. One is a trolley that I bought myself from Kmart to fit my laptop on as well as my some of my personal general teacher supplies - gone! Like the cute stapler I treated myself to last year - all stuff I paid for because I wanted it and not stuff I’d claimed!  Also none of the furniture to my knowledge was damaged or needed repairs, nor am I meant to be moving rooms!\n\nSome of my resources are missing from my locked teacher cupboard (I had some scrap books I got for free off of market pace that I wanted to use for art books because I didn’t want to spend my class budget on extra books, plus free) and the two-to-three extra books that I had left over from last year of my like, English book, spelling etc. they’re gone too! We weren’t asked to hand in any left over resources last year so I have less than 5 of some things. The scrap books aren’t even the same brand or style we use, they were the landscape ones (I don’t know how else to describe them other than they look like half of a regular A3 scrap book). \n\nNow you must be asking - why are you frustrated at yourself OP it isn’t your fault your school is being awful - I’m frustrated at myself because if I’d gone down say a week or go after the carpets had been done I’d have known about it sooner and maybe would have done something about it by now. But with school going back, I’m going to have to do all these extra things on a time crunch I didn’t need because I only allowed for the bare minimum. \nI should have done the bare minimum last week so I had a buffer but I never expected this. So now it’s 1am, on a Monday and I’m so angry I can’t sleep and I’m so frustrated and upset. \n\nHow do you professionally email “who was the jerk who ruined my stuff and stole my things? You have 24 hours to return it or I’ll be escalating it to HR or higher” (just kidding but not really) - I have absolute proof of what I purchased and I have loads of photos of what was in my room, and how it was packed at end of last year, and I also have proof that we were never asked to hand in left overs or remove pinboard items! \n\nWhat’s the bet my 50 lovely, free scrap books will be distributed into the stationary orders because whoever took it thought it was school property? \n\nI can’t believe I have to fix my pinboards and tote draws either, salt on the wounds. \n\nAnd I don’t know if it’s happened to any of my co-workers either because I don’t know that they’ve been in yet (I did send them a warning just in case) and I was too upset to go do a quick check around to see if was the only one or not. \n\nGod, what do I do? I’m such an idiot for not allowing a buffer - my normal workaholic self would have known by now!",

This might be a stupid question but as a nervous grad I feel to embarrassed to ask my DP or Prin :')\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the reassurance! I feel so relieved. Its also reassuring to see having IBS (or any related issues) doesn't mean an end to teaching before I even start 😬 ",

  "selftext": "Hello everyone! First ever post here, but I’m having serious doubts about my career choice and I just need a second opinion. \n\nTo start, teaching was never my first choice, I really wanted to be an animator or concept artist as the arts is an area I’m really passionate about. However, I was dissuaded and convinced that teaching would be a better job choice due to the ability to always find work, holiday and sick pay, and other benefits. So I did, I’m studying a bachelor of secondary education majoring in English and Visual Arts. After my first practice I started to have some doubts though.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I love the idea of teaching, of passing my knowledge and passions onto the younger generation. But I don’t know if teaching is the best way to do it. From disrespectful students who don’t want to be there, to having to manage behaviour and do all this extra unpaid work. I want to teach, but I don’t love anything else surrounding the teaching.\n\nSo here’s the dilemma, I want to change my degree, but don’t know if it’s a smart or sustainable choice. I want to change to a bachelor of design and digital media, which will allow me to go further into the fields I am passionate about, and I was also thinking about releasing online courses once I’ve improved my understanding. That way I can still teach, but only people who want to be there.\n\nSo sorry for the long post, but I really need some advice. Even if you’re just going to tell me I’m overthinking it.\n\nThanks!",

Also, I'm not sure if I can handle the behaviour of students. But I do hope that I would try my best. (I am scared of talking as I have a weird voice that most people can't easily understand. So, I have no clue if that would be a problem with being a sped or other teacher.)\n\nI have done some research and learned that SPED schools are being 'phased out' (I'm really not sure if that's a good idea, my old school had a kid with a social (and intellectual?) disability. He had major behavioural issues during class and was alone during lunch (usually with a teacher was talking to him about something he did though)). So, now that I know SPED schools are most likely disappearing, I would work at a regular school where I could be a SPED and art teacher (maybe, I don’t really know how this works).\n\nSo, if I do become a SPED and/or art teacher, what should I expect? Should I start tutoring kids to see if I can be a teacher? How do SPED schools work (even if they're being removed/I'm mainly just curious now)? Will the removal of SPED school change anything?",

  "selftext": "As many other posters recently, I'm a new teacher about to start my first full time position (very excited!). I've got five English classes from Year 8 - 11. My school is starting some new units this year and I've been told its expected that I come up with my own content for these. Of the four units overall I'm teaching this term, two of them I'm basically just utilising the resources other teachers in the department have developed, and for the other two I'm developing my own. This is not inherently a problem. I've tutored high school English for the past ten years, so I'm not entirely inexperienced, and my head teacher knew this when they asked me to plan the content. For the most part my planning has gone well, and I feel confident for what I've developed - though there's one thing I'm still a bit confused by.\n\nThe unit for my Year 9 class is all about the value of reading. We study a novel in depth (The Outsiders) for the full term. I've been told that we shouldn't actually start in on the novel until week four, and that the first two weeks should be broad lessons/exercises designed to increase student appreciation of reading, and to help them develop an interest in reading, and the third week should be pre-reading activities for this novel specifically.  This is what I'm really struggling with. I have all my content for the actual novel planned, but I'm really scratching my head as to meaningful/engaging exercises that could be done prior to actually reading the novel. I'm in a similar situation with my Year 10 class, in that we're studying a short story for the bulk of the term as part of a module preparing them with the analytical skills they'll need for the HSC, but we're not actually looking at the short story until week three/four. I've done a lot of reading online, but most of what I've found is more appropriate for primary school. My head teacher is also somewhat uncommunicative (which I totally don't blame them for, they're on holiday too!) and I don't have contact details for other teachers in the department yet to ask advice/help.   \n\n\nAny suggestions, advice, or recommendations for good pre-reading activities would be very appreciated.

  "selftext": "Hi all, please be patient with me. I’m not a teacher, my dad is and I’m looking for advice. I may not be referring to everything in the correct terms but I hope you’ll understand.\n \nMy dad has been a teacher for NSW DOE for over 35 years. He had to take leave / go on workers comp due to his mental health caused by the stress of teaching about 5 years ago when he was a head teacher at his high school. He was incredibly bad and I won’t get into it but it was a really rough time for us and honestly still is. He has recovered well and has been doing assignments given to him through workers comp at a different school for the past couple of years. \n\nHe is now wanting to go back to the classroom but as a Learning and Development officer(?) which was what he was doing at these assignments. He has found a position and has been accepted to do it, but the DOE is refusing to allow him to do it because it is not his old head teaching job at the school he took leave from. Mind you this position has since been filled so he can’t go back anyway..\n\nHe heard of an “unassigned permanent teacher” classification from someone he met at one of these assignments and has been trying to get the DOE to allow him to move to that classification so he can stay on as a teacher and not have to resign, but they are not providing a reason for not allowing him to do this and are basically angling at forcing him to medically retire. My understanding is this classification allows him to work without being tied to a school thus getting around the issue of having to return to his old school where there isn’t a position for him anyway. \n\nHe wants to go back to work, this school wants him as he was even head hunted for the role by someone who was teaching with him at the assigned school. I understand there is a shortage of teachers at the moment and I can not fathom how the department are being so pig-headed and not allowing him to do this work that he has proven he can do, and also disallowing the students a good educator amongst the shortage? This is a teacher who has devoted the majority of his life to educating and he is being shown no regard for the service he has provided and home hours he has sacrificed in lesson prep etc. \n\nWe have contacted the federation but they did not help. We are at our wits end with it all and my dads mental health is starting to suffer again because of this. \n\nWhat options do we have? \nHas anyone heard of this classification and know how to get onto it? \nAny other advice? \n\nPlease feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to provide all the info I know of. I have left out some things as this was starting to get very long. \n\nThank you so much for reading!",

Is the large majority of the \"overtime workload\" just teacher admin work or is it 50/50 admin and whatever subject you teach? I don't have any experience teaching yet but would like to have an insight. Thank you!",

I am in no way dreading my return to school as I’m fortunate enough to work in one. But, seeing as I’m very introverted, I’m wondering if I’m better suited to another profession, especially as I have young kids at home and I don’t want to feel drained when I get home to see them. I’m aware that this feeling can occur in any job though. I also am not saying that you can’t be introverted and also a teacher! This will be my 12th year of teaching and 16th year in Education, meaning I’ve pretty much lived my life around a school bell!\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas about some other possible options could be for me to look into? Not looking for an immediate departure into something new but just thinking.\n\nPerhaps something that would suit more independent work, preferably not government sector, even if it is a bit of a pay cut. Recently I’ve heard people mentioning university teacher mentoring. I think that would be a really interesting role. If anyone knows how to look into that specifically, it would be really helpful. I feel like I have thrived when working with pre service teachers and they have consistently given me positive feedback on how I have worked with them.",

  "title": "Seeking Advice: Integrating a Behaviour and Participation Point System into Final Grades?",
  "selftext": "I am preparing to teach Year 8 this year and am in the process of establishing a behaviour management system, an area where I currently lack confidence.\n\nMy plan involves implementing Michael Linsin's point system. Under this system, at the beginning of each lesson, each student starts with four points: two for Behaviour and two for Participation in activities. If a student displays misbehaviour or fails to participate, they lose one point per instance.\n\nFor this system to be effective and for students to take it seriously, it must have real consequences. As such, Linsin suggests to inform the students that 30% of their final grade will be based on their points accumulation. Essentially, the more points they maintain, the higher their final grade will be.\n\nHowever, my experience so far has been in schools where final grades are strictly the average of assessment scores. So, I am uncertain if it's feasible to allocate 30% of the final grade to this point system.\n\nI am reaching out to this community for advice and insights. Have any of you implemented a similar system in your classrooms? More importantly, how do you incorporate such behaviour and participation scores into the final grades? I am especially curious about the feasibility and potential challenges of allocating a significant portion of the final grade to these points.\n\nYour experiences, suggestions, and any relevant resources would be immensely helpful.\n\n&#x200B;",

It's very open planned, student led, lots of coteaching, focus on EQ development, seems similar to Montessori. Any tips on working in an environment like that?",

I currently live in the US where teachers are underpaid and undervalued and my husband and I were considering moving to a different country (for other reasons as well) and I read that Australia is great for teachers in terms of treatment and pay, well anywhere besides the US lol. We were looking into Perth, but we’re open to other areas but I had so many questions about even being a teacher in Australia. I would love to teach computer science in upper grades (I’m not sure how grades are or what you all would consider middle or high school). \n\n- What is getting a cert like in Australia? How long does it take? \n\n- What areas do you suggest we live in to pursue my career? We have a two year old as well. \n\n- What is the pay like? \n\n- Should I consider moving to AUS as an American? Does it matter? \n\n\nI have my bachelors in Cyber Security and am prior military if that helps with my background. Thank you all very much for your help and patience.",

I understand that joining a union is voluntary, and let's say if I'm interested in joining, which union would you guys recommend? I've heard of AEU and TPAA. I saw a few posts saying TPAA is not really advocating for teachers' rights (not sure if it's true), so I am eyeing to join AEU. Are there any alternatives other than these two?\n4.

Is it a one-off payment type of thing that you get when you sign the contract/ receive your first salary, or...?\n\nI would really appreciate it if you had any other advice that you'd like to give. I'm really excited for this opportunity and don't really want to mess it up because I misread/misinterpreted some terms and clauses. Thanks!",

  "selftext": "**TLDR:** What would you do if students are often walking 5 abreast and bumping into your shoulder without saying sorry? You can't move over but they can and should. You don't have the time or patience to stop and lecture all of them every single time it happens because you have to rush off to class. \n\n**Long rant:**\n\nI work at densley packed high school. Teenagers are noutorious for being totally unaware of their surroundings and having bad social ettiquette. They will walk next to their friends despite the narrow space really needing single-file. They do not move over for people coming in the opposite direction, and I can't move over if there is a wall, so shoulder bumps are frequent. \n\nI don't think its good for teachers and students to be bumping shoulders. I often will just stop walking so it is abundantly clear that they are walking into me, sometimes I might say \"excuse you\" kinda pointedly, because how is it socially acceptable for them to take up the entire path then hit someones shoulder and not say \"sorry\" or \"excuse me\"? Not sure how else to deal with it, I'm not going to stop and lecture every single one of them about common courtsey when I need to get to class. Pretty sick of how rude they are but I also know that their brains are not fully developed. \n\nOne time a girl has seen me coming, moved like two centimetres (walking next to 4 of her friends, again I can't move over but she can go behind her friends for a moment) and her shoulder hit mine and she made an offended noise and glared at me - as if I should've turned incorporeal and phased through the wall to avoid her! \n\nOf course, it doesn't help that I'm a young male teacher who kinda blends in with students, so I also think with some teenage boys its a dominance thing. One has stared me in the eyes as he purposely hit my shoulder. I stopped and lectured him and he literally said \"oh shit, you're a teacher?!\". Fml. This is a school with no uniform so it makes it a bit harder, but I do wear polo shirts and a name tag. What more can I do?! I *almost* muttered \"fucking idiot\" last time a male student ran into me during crunch time. Not a good look for a teacher. In every other aspect of my career, I am getting positive feedback and feel like I'm doing really well, but walking between classes makes me feel like a failure, being pushed around by teenagers. \n\nIf you've read this far in my rant, thank you!",

But growing up me and my mother experienced extreme violence at the hands of my father and applying myself at school was the least on mind as a young fella which had hindered my schooling all throughout both primary and secondary. It was only after they both passed in my late teens and early twenty’s I started thinking about teaching again and if it was possible for me. Basically I just wanna know is there still a chance?

Anyway, I'd love some feedback and advice re this question of mine. I really want to not mess up when I next do my prac. Anyone got any ideas about some classroom management for high schoolers? Here is what I'm thinking:\n\n1. Make sure 'rules' are established early (like the bell doesn't dismiss you, I do; respectful and safe environment, raise your hand etc).\n2. Treat them like mini adults, but remember they are not.\n3. Appraise myself of the school's rules re unruly behaviour and follow procedure.\n4. Explain at beginning of the lesson what the learning outcome will be and what is expected.\n5. Ensure everything is ready at beginning of lesson.\n6.

  "selftext": "Hello! I am considering a few tertiary offers currently, one Masters of Teaching which will qualify me to teach Secondary Drama - I have two undergrad degrees one in communications (performance studies) and Acting and 15 years as a working actor for major theatre companies. I may be able to get an additional teaching area in English (7 to 10) as well per NESA guidelines, pending advice from the course coordinator. So best case I'm qualified to teach Drama (7 to 12) and English (7 to 10).\n\nMy other option is to suck it up and do a 4 year bachelors - looking at English (7 to 12) and Modern History (7 to 12) with EAL or Geography potentially as an additional teaching area. The course I've been offered doesn't allow for credit or advanced standing for drama subjects weirdly, so tending towards EAL.\n\nMy current course plan for the masters would take 3 years (with a few periods of part-time study due to work). If I did the bachelors I'd stick to full-time and do it in 4.\n\nI understand there's a teacher shortage in the pipeline, but I suspect not for Drama teachers...any anecdotal help re. the current employment landscape for Drama (7 to 12)  teachers?  Can anyone give me an idea of the likelihood of a permanent Drama teacher position post graduation? I have a pretty decent resume and teaching experience, including teaching specialist classes to NSW Drama teachers. But really wanting to find a permanent position post graduation. Willing to relocate to regional centres (think Lismore, Albury-Wodonga, Tamworth or interstate).",

  "selftext": "Edit:\n\n* Victorian modern cursive is the name of the unconnected font. I'm not trying to teach my child to read cursive.\n* I'm not trying to teach my child to write! \n* I got interested in the way kids learn to read, went down a rabbit hole and learned some of the terminology. I think it's cool. That's the only reason I used the words here in this post, you're all teachers, I thought I'd try to use your language. I'm aware now that makes me look super over the top. \n* I'm aware of milestones; I think everyone learns at their own pace and has their own interests. I don't think it's generally helpful to think in terms of 'ahead' and 'behind', \"they should be doing this at this age, that at that age\", except in cases where it could indicate something like a disorder where intervention can be helpful. Being aware of milestones is fine so you've got a general idea of what generally happens when, but not to stress over, or set expectations by. Every kid is different.\n* Play play and all play! Play is how kids learn, it's how adults learn best too! I am a very enthusiastic advocate for play.\n* Just because this one post is about reading doesn't remotely mean I think reading or academics is the most important thing. Learning to be a good person, independence and creativity, learning to processes emotions, even just learning basic life skills are all far, far more important. \n* Yes, my kid is younger than most kids who can read. Everyone is different okay? I don't think he is neurodivergent, he's met his milestones at the typical time or slightly early, except language. I don't think he's gifted, it's just language. He had like 400 words at his 18 month checkup. \n* I'm not shoving anything down anyone's throat. Just because he's  good with words doesn't mean I'm torturing him into performing. I mean, you can't force your kid to speak early anyway even if you were like that, so it's got to be coming from him. I talk to him, I read to him, he speaks, he reads. Chill everybody. Everyone is different.  \n\n\nHi teachers, I have a question! I'm not a teacher, I'm the parent of a preschooler.\n\nI'm in Victoria. Do you still teach Victorian modern cursive (VMC)? My son knows his letters and can read small words (sounding out CVCs with single letter graphemes with their most common sound) . Should I familiarize him with VMC? I downloaded the font and set it on Notepad but b and p and z are terrible. r is pretty confusing too.\n\nI'm thinking of making my own font that is like VMC but makes these letters a little more recognizable. Something to bridge the gap. I'm thinking, VMC b with a bit more curve so it completes or nearly completes the round part, p with a lot more curve so it completes or nearly completes the round part, not really sure what to do about k looking like a mutant capital R ... maybe squash the round part a bit? cut the loop entirely? z is a monstrosity that I have no idea how to fix.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Complete waste of time because no one uses VMC anymore? Or leave VMC as is and teach that? Or maybe a good idea?",

  "selftext": "male, now early 30s, melbourne, study areas bio / chem\n\nSorry for essay! (it is holidays though!)\n\ni was doing Mteach 6-7years ago. Of the 16 units, i completed 13 of them, including 2 placements (3 total). Technically my study is on pause - i could go back and finish those 3 units even now. \n\n-------------\n\nDuring the final semester (capstone masters research project thing which includes the 3rd placement)... i kind of.. broke. Immediately that placement just never worked for me, and within a week i had left, and by the weekend i had told the uni i was dropping out of teaching (voluntarily withdrew / paused). \n\nBut its not the usual story, and honestly i still can't really put my finger on to this day. \n\n------------\n\nMy previous 2 placements went pretty flawlessly - I would imagine the placement teacher would have been quite surprised if they saw the difference. I would think they would have given me strong references/review - and never had any issues really beyond just learning + inexperience which is natural. And i enjoyed it, for the most part. They weren't particularly different - challenging, age group, class size, etc. Even the placement teacher had about a week off sick and i ran the class with CRTs and (totally not perfectly) it was mostly ok (for me and the class) \n\nI actually prefer and work better with the weaker and more disruptive kids, mostly. An issue I found was that my own learning methods were so independent, introverted, self motivated, that is was hard to genuinely approach learning for kids who wanted to learn and weren't like that. So the older, behaved, classes were more of a challenge. But put a kid who is disruptive and difficult I'm gentle and take it on their level, and keep it calm and chill. \n\nPracticals and science things were also tough. If you know the sort of 'yay science crowd' thats the complete opposite to me. I don't find science special, or the scientific method effective, nor interesting, nor even worth teaching. Which don't get me wrong - I do it all in my own way, and do value the process, and I'm not saying it shouldn't be done. But its prescriptive, drab, sucks the life out of it, and misses the truth of what science is. You can dress up bullshit in hypotheses and evidence bases - its the methods, intent, reflection, review, peer accountability, these sorts of things are what defines a good study from a bad one. Which is to say, there's a pressure and a culture to be that 'yay science' or scientific method is good, and its embedded in the curriculum and culture and expectations - and it just messes with my brain because i don't believe it to be true. but you also don't want to be pushing the meta-concept stuff when their just trying to learn what mitochondria are. \n\nThe underlying philosophy has a strong effect on everything you do, and it was a big factor. I remember feeling high levels of planning paralysis, of just too much complexity and lack of clarity in what and how i wanted to teach/plan. When ideally it would be something simple and functional - because placement is really just about surviving and establishing a baseline of competency. On that 3rd placement my plans were legitimately awful, because of these clashing philosophies (and pressure of the masters research project also needing put in). I pretty much didn't have a lesson plan, not from lack of time nor trying, but just my brain just couldn't get anything functional out. \n\nWhich then it follows, that for the couple of math classes I did, it was fine, I actually quite enjoyed it, and could see myself doing that (i'm not math trained though, beyond just science overlap). Because its just, work along the curriculum which is a bit 'brain-off' in that space, and take the lesson at its immediate skills and values, and respond to where the kids are at. Though I observed some strong math teacher who showed the nuances beyond that which was also inspiring and eye opening. \n\n-------------\n\nAnd i also just got really sick. And i had Mteach assignments + placement at the time. + final semester and life things gets messy at that point\n\nand that placement was messy - i didn't have any time for feedback or supervision really because the placement teacher was sick, and so me being kind of lost + that compounded pretty nastily. And just the classrooms were shitty and totally didn't suit me and really made me uncomfortable / threw me off\n\ni did cry so much though, i had such a emotional response and it was very intense time. So i'm hesitant to just go - yeh - it will be fine!\n\n-------------\n\nso where am i at now. Even years later i still don't know if i made the right decision to walk away. Was it just a bad experience and bad outlier.  \n\nAlienation of the Mteach theory stuff just sort of drained me, which is fair because teachers all criticise it for being not really what the job and the skills needed is about. Did i take those feelings too far, see something fundamentally wrong in me, where maybe it was just a conflicting time for everyone and those feelings are normal. \n\nI have trauma and things too, so its messy and hard to put boundaries on where all the issues were. So isolation of Mteach is like, triggering, but if everyone is a bit in that space, and I take it to be critically excluded because trauma. \n\nAgain this affects how you teach it - philosophy of not having a teacher and having to learn it myself, not feeling part of the science 'culture' despite being qualified. Very much feeling an outsider, from trauma and isolation but also from within the science community. I love the apprenticeship model - of kids being invited to try and share someone who is a professional in that field and owns that cultural space. But i feel excluded from that space, even with a degree or two - and it feels disingenuous of me to promise something which has shifted to be something of a lie. Science is politicised, and weaponised, and elitist, its not some pure thing of truth and a better future anymore. Which that adversarial, conflict, style thoughts is ultimately what got me through my own study and let me keep my own sanity, but its projecting a lot of my own issues into the kids. But to teach outside of that space is dishonest and  not genuine, and conflicts me deeply, and ties my mind in knots. \n\n------\n\ni don't know still\n\n * i know i didn't mind the kids and they were good to be around, and i had a naturally calm and good manner with them\n * i know i love science, if i am given the freedom to define it myself and not be too constrained \n * i can bury my ego and work with the curriculum and some expectations to an extent, thats ok. \n * i liked the culture and purpose of schools and what their trying to do, its something motivating and attractive. \n * i know science and teachers both are needed, and good ones. I'm doing it for the right reasons and put the effort in, if i do.\n * I know i'm a weirdo in many ways, so many schools wouldn't suit me, but that doesn't mean no schools would suit me. Somewhere quieter where i can be myself more. I'm not looking to be some private school career high flyer track.\n * my life currently is a bit of a mess and i'm just... why reinvent myself again when there's this thing that was maybe good, that im basically done, and maybe I just misread it at that brief messy moment\n * i still don't really know in my heart if i made the right decision, its not clear\n\ni was browsing many posts and so many comments said things like - you'll really know after placements. Well i don't! Or i see both ways. I don't know. opinions appreciated + thanks if you do",

  "selftext": "Edit- thank you all for the love and advice. I know it might seem silly to some to stew on such a day, but it really knocked the wind out of me. To be clear- I absolutely loved every single one of my students, and I am so proud of them for the way that they grew this year but we had some really bad times and days and this took the cake. Thank you all for reminding me that it’s likely not a me problem (and that if honestly a party that they disliked is the worst of their problems, they have it pretty good) I still find myself thinking about them and hoping they’re alright over Christmas and the fact I didn’t get to see them for a next day to try and repair the relationships really broke my heart more than the actual day itself. For many of them I knew that I was their safe place despite what they’d say or do. What I’ve done is gone back through all the nice messages parents have sent me for the Xmas break and some of the heartfelt card some of the kids wrote. It made me feel better. I know that stuff is always out of my control, and that sometimes things happen that aren’t a result of me. Moving forward I’m going to try and make celebration earlier in the term and have a low key, largely outside day I think (so long as the weather is nice) - I don’t know what possessed me to do it this way this year, I guess it’s because I felt like I could celebrate because it was the first class at a new school and for the first time I didn’t have to fear for my safety (physical) every day. I think in terms of behaviour moving forward I think I have to make even more effort to acknowledge all the kids doing the right thing the entire time and boost them up even more. thank you all again and Happy New Year let us all draw a line under things that have happened and start looking toward to things that could happen next year. I have a beautiful looking group for next year with only three returning students from this class so I think I will be ok. \n\nIt’s well past midnight and I can’t sleep because I keep replaying the last day to term in my head. Sorry for typos this tablet is old and glitchy.\n\nHonestly, I loved each kid with my whole teaching heart this year but collectively they were a lot. \n\nWe’d been planning our last two days and class party for weeks (in pockets of time) we’d mapped out a day for cleaning up, finishing off, art, Christmas presents making and songs. The last day we’d do the final pack up, have a karaoke party and have some food. Now due to allergies in the class, I cleared with the parents everything (and admin) and ultimately it was safer for me to order in some food which would be safe for everyone, rather than have each person bring something. I didn’t mind paying, I like to do something as like a send off, and it’s the only time I’ve taken over the food because of allergies, normally I wouldn’t foot the bill but I thought why not.\n\nWell the last week went well until the last day. I put up the agreed timetable on the board, the movie they picked etc. then it started going down hill. \n\nFour students practically rioted because the movie we all voted on wasn’t their movie  (we’d agreed for weeks). Their popcorn “wasn’t from the microwave because OP is too cheap to have one in our class” a couple threw it at each other and got exited. \n\nA group ruined the first game and didn’t allow anyone else to have fun, which upset one of the other students who ran out of the room crying. I called admin to have them collected/cared for and that’s when another kid loudly exclaimed “this just fucking sucks, I’m going to remember this day and compare every event to it, least we can see if it compares to OPs last day party and as long as it is better I’ll be happy.” - at that point a senior staff person came back with upset student, and I asked if they could cover a minute because I needed it. I got to the staff room and cried. \n\nI just couldn’t take it anymore. The ungrateful, bratty behaviour and the fact that because four of them weren’t happy no one was allowed to be. I have had such a struggle all year and they couldn’t even suck it up for half a day (assembly the latter half). \n\nI felt the unbelievable urge to leave. I just couldn’t stop crying. I felt so helpless. \nFortunately (I mean in a warped way) that group was also rude to the senior staff person so we’re taken out of class when I returned. \n\nAnd they missed out on the food because of it (dw they were all fed, I’d made it very clear party was not a meal so to bring lunch and recess as normal). Everyone was a lot happier without them but you could tell it had soured it.\n\nIt was so aggregating to see the class next door doing the same thing and the students being grateful and happy. \n\nI always get the hardest batch. In past years I’ve been able to flip them but there’s always pockets of this class that have turned for no reason (not the same ones all the time). I’ve never been more emotionally exhausted. I’m bitter in my reflection of the year while there were many highlights and happy times - not one wasn’t sabotaged by someone or a small group. \n\nI can’t even look forward to next year because I can’t help but think it’s going to be the same.\n\nI know I’m not perfect and I never strive to be - I also don’t expect them all to like me. But I didn’t expect them all to sabotage each others and my happiness for sport. \n\nI hate how you can academically and pedagogically do your best, you follow every due process and throw all supports you can, including getting families on side as wells supported by admin and senior staff  - and shit still goes wrong? How is that fair? I honestly feel cursed and like I failed. \n\nI even got them a tiny end of term thank you gift each and I found two in the trash.\n\nI don’t think I can do this anymore. I know some people will say “you don’t get anything out of teaching so stop going in there thinking your kids owe you something” that’s not what I’m trying to say. I’m saying the sheer lack of compassion and empathy and the sheer delight in drama and pain they can cause to people real concerns me moving forward. I don’t think I’ll ever be prepared for that. \n\nI just needed to vent. I know  people are going to say I sent myself up to get upset but whatever, l won’t make that mistake again.",

  "selftext": "Hello, I thought it would be good to get some teachers views on this. \n\nI left highschool about 7 years ago and am back in my hometown for the holidays. As part of my trip home I dropped by my old (public) highschool for a bit of nostalgia, and a bit into the school grounds to show my girlfriend where I'd gone to school. Before entering we saw a lady walking around the school grounds with her two toddlers, so we thought it would be okay to do (while noting the 'no trespassing signs' at the front). We were there for about 5 minutes and just had a look at the general quad area as well as looked into some classroom windows that I recalled having classes in a number of years ago. I'm planning on retraining as a teacher from my current legal career so have been very nostalgic about my time in highschool recently. \n\nWhile leaving i noticed some cctv cameras which may have captured us walking in and out, and in the school.  This got me thinking, is this something we could have gotten in trouble for? ( it is obviously illegal to trespass on school grounds which we were technically doing, but is it something that would be enforced at your school?) Are teachers bothered by people wandering into school grounds during school holidays, and is it very common in your experience? If there was a break in at the school in the next week and the cctv footage was reviewed, would we be likely to get in trouble? Relatedly, how long do schools usually hold cctv footage for ( I assume a few months). Thanks in advance for any answers - there was never cctv cameras at school when I was there, and indeed I had schoolfriends who used to go and skate around the school grounds on weekends, but I'm not sure if this activity is becoming less accepted or not?

The Aus Govt is making training as a teacher (Masters of Teaching, as I already have a Bachelor) free next year (or so I hear, I have a consultation to actually clarify this in the next few days), it is a 2 year course and afterwards I would be qualified to teach either full time or as a substitute teacher. Right now around where I am (Mitcham VIC) we have so few teachers in the area that all my teacher friends are working full time HOURS with none of the take-home work, and the hourly rate is very competitive, upwards of $60ph it seems, plus they can always just take a day off.  \nThis offers a combination of benefits, I can work casually and when I have a music project I can just not take shifts for 2 weeks etc, and then when I eventually need to apply for a home loan I can get basically guaranteed work in the field, and then if I have the time/energy AFTER the work day I can do more music after the school day ends.\n\nOn top of this I am well educated on a broad range of subjects and I do actually care about education, I don't want anyone to think I'm just in it for an easy/casual day rate, it would be great longer-term to be involved with the school community, productions, musical performances.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar situation? And is teaching worth it or am I wasting time retraining? Am I going to regret it is the main question.  \nPlease dismiss my ideas and expectations of the field if they are unrealistic lol.\n\n  \nThe other options is not bad either, but far less flexible. Obviously option 1 is the main thing I'm on this sub for, but if you know anything about this please feel free to chime in too!  \n2. If I'm going to study for 2 years anyway, I can study something ELSE that might yield a higher wage, but with the caveat that it is far less likely to be the kind of situation where I can just work on and off and then step into a full-time career afterwards. I thought about legal aid and healthcare work which seem to both have options in the 1 and 2 year range also, but I know those jobs also have their detractors.  \nWhat else could I study that might be a good decision either financially or in terms of flexibility?  \n\n\nAll input appreciated\n\nEdit: Masters of Teaching, not Masters of Education",

Google Transfer - The only option was to transfer across the entire Google drive (ie I could not select individual folders) which included all the files from my Google Classrooms and any files that have been shared with me. This quickly filled up the 100gb in my personal drive, some files randomly duplicated and some files did not copy across at all. \n2. Google Takeout - Downloaded my department Google Drive as several zip files but found that files within the same folder were split across multiple different zip files for some reason.\n3. Downloading each folder from my department drive as a zip file to upload to personal drive - This worked mostly okay except all my Google docs and Google slides became Word docs and powerpoint files respectively and this has changed all the formatting. \n4. Copy + paste files across - Able to copy files but cannot copy entire folders 🙃\n\nAt this moment, I feel like I have to manually go through each folder in my personal drive to see what has transferred over and to make sure it is in the correct file format. \n\nIf anyone has had experience with this, I would very much appreciate any advice before I begin this arduous process.

Does this mean I'll be fully resigned from the department, or moved into TRACER automatically? I did activate a TRACER account but was immediately signed up by my school before I did any casual days so I am unfamiliar with the process. There's no tabs about TRACER for me to access in the mrhr recruitment, is this just because it's the end of the year and/or I'm still official full time? Will I have to re-submit an application to teach and select casual?

The problem was different classes did the tests on different days, but I had two rather cunning methods to catch cheaters. \n\n1. Using different versions of the test. Now, this isn't overly special, but what I did was had the first five multiple choice questions be the same, then a series of four multiple choice questions that were the same as the previous test, but with the options re-ordered. This would catch people who used shared answers.\n2. Using a 'decoy' question that was impossible to answer by hand but could be answered with a phone/calculator very easily. After the test, I removed the question. This would catch out students who used phones.\n\nI didn't expect to catch anything, but after looking at their work, I've caught five students. \n\nThe first four fell for the multiple choice trap. There answers were identical to that of another (earlier sat by another class) version of the test. Interestingly, they didn't answer the decoy question correctly.\n\nThe fifth student correctly answered the decoy question. This student also went on a bathroom break during the test.\n\nNow my dilemma is, I found out that the punishment for cheating on an assessment is either repeating a grade or EXPULSION (private school).

  "selftext": "Hi! I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask but I'd appreciate any pointers in the right direction :)\n\nI completed a 4-year degree in Music Education in California, and I taught at a private high school for a few years. I did a year's worth of student teaching as part of my bachelor's degree, but I never completed my California Teaching Credential, as it's only required for public school teachers, not private. \n\nI'm now transitioning to a new career area, and my partner and I have moved to Melbourne. I'm looking for part time work to do in between my own studies, and I really do miss the classroom. I'm wondering how plausible it would be to do some relief teaching over the next year or two. What might my path to VIT registration look like, given I technically never completed my California credential?  For what it's worth, I've moved on a working holiday visa, and we'll be filing our partner visa within a few months. \n\nI'd love to hear anyone's own experience with relief teaching! ",

I'm starting all my programming and planning and I'm finding the syllabus a bit vague for the Year 11 'Reading to Write' Common Module.

I've been told it's totally up to me (very excited to be choosing all my texts!) and I'm not sure which direction to go in. For those who have taught this module what's the 'ideal' number of texts, and how do your spread them across different modes?   \n\n\nAt the moment I'm thinking 5 - 6 texts consisting of 2 short stories, 1 graphic novel, 1 poem, one short filmic text, and a non-fiction text like a speech. So far I've selected 'The Sniper' by Liam O'Flaherty, 'The Paper Menagerie' by Ken Liu, I'm leaning towards a Gwen Harwood poem like 'Last Meeting', and I'm leaning towards Julia Gillard's 'Misogyny' speech.

  "title": "Canadian Teacher moving to Australia (few struggles/concerns/ideas)",
  "selftext": "Hello again All,\n\n**Thanks** for all the help in the previous post!\n\nI am a Canadian qualified General Science/Biology/Environmental Science/French Teacher (Grades 7-12). I recently got the PR Visa 189 which means that I have no work or location restrictions.\n\nI do not have any Australian work experience but have roughly 3-4 years teaching experience in Canada/UK. Nothing long term at one place though.\n\nSo here's a few things that I discovered based on my research so far.\n\n1. All international teachers are classed as **PROVISIONAL** teachers regardless of teaching experience. Apparently because you don't have Australian work experience. This is the case in Victoria and ACT. Not sure about elsewhere? A private school I interviewed with in ACT gave me different salaries for a **PROVISIONAL** and **FULLY** registered teachers. From my understanding one has to teach for a while and prove their skills/abilities to be moved to the FULLY registered category.\n\nCould someone **please** shed light on this? Is it unfair that there is different salaries even for experienced international teachers? It seems like we would start at teacher graduate level pay because our years of experience in overseas schools aren't considered. With the teacher shortage, shouldn't teacher registration authorities make it easier to get full accreditation for overseas teachers?\n\n1. 2. An overseas teacher **cannot** complete the teacher registration process etc unless they are **physically present** in Australia. So even though I can interview, accept a position etc. virtually, I won't be able to make progress work-wise unless I come over weeks, maybe months in advance to start the teacher registration process as it is a requirement in each state/territory to have their own state's teacher registration.\n\nI taught in the UK on a Working holiday visa a few years ago. The UK teaching authority gave full QTS status to teachers qualified in the USA, Canada, NZ and Australia without any issues. Similarly, it is easy for me to become a qualified teacher in NZ as a Canadian. So again, given the teacher shortage maybe the process needs to be *simplified* in Australia?\n\n1. 3. Student behaviour is a big issue in Australia from what I have seen/read. When I taught in the UK, I remember that the behaviour was horrendous. I had PTSD because of it. I left the profession and went on to do a Master of Science degree. Now I am wanting to give teaching another try. That is why I am leaning more towards private schools ( I heard that they have better behaviour? )\n2. Most private schools are advertising **permanent positions**. One school however offered a 12 month contract. They said its better because it gives the chance to get to know each other and if it doesn't work we can part ways. I am not sure if that's the best option? I know even if it is permanent, one can leave if it isn't working out. Does one get more support and resources if permanent? I would imagine so... \n\n*Should I be picky?* Because I have a Master of Science degree\n\nCan I have Principals/Schools take my years of experience into consideration and pay me accordingly? What should I consider? Ask for? Any advice?\n\nAlso I also looked at the possibility of skipping teaching altogether and pursuing Graduate internships in Environmental Science? There are many amazing sounding 2 years graduate programs! But I feel I should giving teaching in Australia a try? I feel that I should help out during this teaching shortage crisis...\n\nI am thinking about ACT because Canberra teachers are slated to be the best paid in the country over the next few years. But I realize Canberra is very expensive and boring too...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nANY ideas, answers, thoughts and/or discussion would be great! Especially from any Canadian expat teachers that have some insights.\n\n&#x200B;",

I already had the plan in my head half-way through this year, and have actually got some training done since then. I originally wanted to leave at the end of the year. However, I had a few commitments that required financial stability and also was busy in the last 2 terms that delayed my job-seeking process.\n\nNow it is the end of the year when it is too late to resign (I already signed the contract for next year) due to being asked to give a few-week notice. Also, I don't want to leave so unprofessionally, leaving people who have supported me a lot. But what if I am able to secure another job over the holiday, but I can't resign (I heard that if I resign late, e.g., now, I will not be paid the 2-week holiday before term 1 next year)? Or can I just keep searching until I get one then resign? Maybe in the first or second term next year? Will it be ok to resign then?\n\nAnyway, I would like to hear from you any advice on having a smooth transition to another career (in terms of timing in resigning, or any aspects that you think I should know about).\n\nSorry for a long post.

  "title": "What is your actual working hours (mine shared)?",
  "selftext": "I am a teacher of English language in China. Been following this sub for some time. This is my first year of teaching and I found the teaching work quite demanding. I will share my working hours here, and I want to know yours to see whether teachers in Australia work longer/shorter.\n\nSo I am currently teaching primary (grade 6). The official working time is from 8 to 18 with a 2-hour rest from 12-14 So it's 10 hours staying in the workplace and 8 hours of actual work time. I consider it a 10-hour work.\n\nThe actual working hours are different. Normally the morning reading (this is a section of each teaching day that is common in China where students read textbooks to practice/memorize stuff) starts from 7:50 to 8:20 Therefore, you are required to arrive at school at 7:50 at the very least. In actual practice for English teachers, the morning usually ends at about 11:30 becasue our classes normally will have finished by then. At noon teachers are required to supervise students sleeping (this is normal in China) which lasts from 12:40 to 13:50 The afternoon starts at 14:00 and ends at 17:30. Yes you can leave early and it's a thing. However, if there are meetings you will leave later depending on the length of the meetings. In conclusion, the actual working time is: 220 minutes in the morning+70 minutes at noon+180 minutes in the afternoon. In total, 470 minutes or 7 hours and 50 minutes. \n\nIn terms of working content, it differs based on the subject you are teaching. As a teacher of English you normally have 2-3 classes each day and about 110 assignments to give feedback on. The time needed to finish these teaching work varies, but on average it takes about 3- 4 hours per day and is usually done in the morning. In the afternoon, time is dedicated to teaching preparation/communication with parents, etc. Little teaching work nees to be done in the afternoon.\n\nOverall, I would say teaching a major subject (English, Math and Chinese) in China in primary level is median level of working hours compared to other careers in China.

  "title": "NSW Teacher Discrimination? What to do?",
  "selftext": "I don't know if this is \"a thing\" or not, but I would really appreciate some feedback from experienced education staff on this.\n\nI'm also curious to hear if any other teachers can identify with the circumstances, and what avenues of recourse they pursued.\n\nThis is actually not about me, but my partner, so I apologise if I sound frustrated or biased, I am, but it's also why I'm putting this out there for your thoughts and ideas.\n\nI'm also not a teacher myself, but she is, as is my brother, sister and several other close friends, many of whom are experienced/senior staff in an adjacent state.\n\nHaving reviewed the circumstances time and again, we've unanimously concluded that my partner is being outright discriminated against, blocking the basic developmental opportunities that other teachers are regularly afforded through the natural course of their careers (who are obviously not discriminated against).\n\nBetween us, we've a handful of theories and cannot decide whether it's because of:\n\n* her race (not Aussie, but English is first language),\n* a rumour that she has been wanting to get pregnant for some time,\n* being pigeon-holed to suit school business model,\n* an undisclosed lack of teaching ability, or\n* a mix of the above (most likely).\n\nA pattern has emerged and it's had and continues to have a tangible psychological impact on her.\n\nIn a nutshell, a school that she has been incredibly loyal to for the past few years (5 or 6?) simply, ***will not***, ***under any circumstances***, humour her for a role teaching a class, whether long or short term. She has been relegated to teaching RFF or teaching day to day at the school's absolute convenience and she cannot for the life of her break out of the cycle, despite requests to senior staff time and again for more significant engagement.\n\nMeanwhile, other staff regularly come and go from the school, including those fresh out of university and others who fall pregnant whether permanent or on contract. These staff are welcomed to or back to the school no matter what it seems, while my partner observes them from the bench, dreaming of having their defiant employability and job security as they appear to swan in and out at their total discretion.\n\nStrangely, my partner doesn't appear to be \"undesirable\", whatever that looks like exactly. She is slight, unassuming, professional, and experienced (backed by references). She is very well-spoken, gets along very well with people and has excellent manners, showing every respect to others regardless of circumstances. She is compliant, cordial and gets her job done, responding favourably to every request made of her in a professional setting.\n\nNotably, she would consider almost any role, if not all roles including the ones that expose her to students that are actively abusive towards teachers (rife within our geographical area), and has expressed this in no uncertain terms if by no other means than returning to teach classes that other teachers literally abandon mid-class and refuse to return to.\n\nIn fact, many of her colleagues are particular about which cohort they will/won't teach, what days they will not work, and which staff they're willing to collaborate with. My partner on the other hand would be glad to take *any* opportunity. This, to me, is an indicator of just how excellent her work-ethic and dedication is, in and of itself deserving of acceptance and some form of job security.\n\nYet she is not given any classroom roles, used at the school's absolute convenience and discarded to favour other staff who are... different somehow (this is the very painful mystery).\n\nThe argument for her exclusion has been given to her more recently, that many candidates are applying, and that there are just too many experienced staff to consider her for the roles.\n\nMy partner has 15 years experience and is fully accredited. Some of her colleagues who are getting classroom roles are fresh out of university, or have only graduated in the last year or 2. I feel frustrated on her behalf to extremes about this because she is being completely misled as if it's not entirely obvious to her, and anyone else within earshot. This is disgraceful as far as I'm concerned, infuriates me, and can only be emphasis on the fact that this seems to be a clear-cut case of racism, or some other form of discrimination. She is not unintelligent by any stretch of the imagination, the opposite is true.\n\nThe clarification offered is that she has no \"classroom teaching experience\", not enough experience with planning a particular cohort's curriculum, while others do.\n\nBut those referred to include new staff recently out of university, and certainly a number who are a decade or more behind her in general experience.\n\nMy partner also has a huge physical and digital library at home of teaching resources, lesson plans both designed and purchased to meet the specific curriculum of all cohorts, that she draws from every time she provides relief. She doesn't do art with the kids, watch movies or otherwise babysit them..  she teaches them, which I'm told by others is more than can be said for some other relief teachers.\n\nImportantly, how can anyone get enough experience in teaching a class, without being given the opportunity.. to teach in class!? She's been waiting for her first opportunity at this school for 5 years! They gave one staff member fresh out of university (among a number of others over this period) her first classroom gig 2 years ago, and she has been employed since and is still getting a place where my partner is not. I mean this is extremely hard for her to see, and I would say almost abusive to then go and tell her that that's not what's happening. Really? I hate the word, but isn't that some form of gaslighting? It certainly seems to be exclusion.\n\nThis obviously can't be a valid justification and is just a poor excuse to keep her at arms length from a more concrete role - for some reason.\n\nNo path or suggestions are being made about alternative pursuits that could help her work her way in. Apparently, she's at a dead end.\n\nAdditionally, it seems like NSW Education (and maybe other) principals can bring in friends, or friends' kids fresh out of university, and do people favours at will, while other loyal staff, in need, are being neglected, intentionally so in some instances.\n\nThis psychological impact on my partner is significnt. She understandably feels unliked, inadequate, guilty thinking she MUST have done something to upset someone. She feels totally excluded and breaks down at home on a regularly basis, but gathers herself and goes back into work with a straight face like a proper trooper. Understandably she feels like that she's regarded as being different somehow, whether it's because of race or some other reason.\n\nAdditionally, particularly at the outset, she was poorly treated by other female staff (yes, male teachers showed her every courtesy - she is easy on the eye) who either refused to acknowledge her, say good morning, speak to her and a range of other petty child-like behaviours that apparently remain part of an adult female teacher's abusive arsenal. This extended to conversations in which she was an immediate participant. Absolutely, unforgiveable as far as I'm concerned. Like play-groound bullying but by full-grown adults.\n\nHer polite and humble perseverance in the face of all of this, despite the psychological cost to her, is nothing short of remarkable, and concretes her place at this school as perhaps as one of the most loyal contributors, I think.\n\nThe idiom \"kill them with kindness\" occurs to me in coming to consider the incredible humility required to navigate the \"catiness\" that infects the teacher population, which extends to staff meetings and other collaborative settings. Her acceptance of accountability for others' deflections, ducking and weaving, bathroom cries, every bit of her endurance needed to eventually break the back of this element of the abusive behaviour.\n\nGenerally, now, after 5 years, the staff has \"come round\" and warmed to her, and she's regarded as largely \"worthy\" somehow. Even those who ignored her or were rude to her directly, are polite to her now, even friendly, as if nothing ever happened, which she still finds oddly confronting at times. She's made it to the social summit and seems to be a part of the community, but not before a lot of damage was done.\n\nAnd.. it's strictly personal. Stubbornly, whatever acceptance she has accrued has not extended to her professional engagement, and I don't know it's realistic to think it might some day, is it? Given the history so far.\n\nShe has offered to and participated in extra-curricular programs, continued her professional development like a true champion limping along the track with a busted ham string, knowing full well that her pursuits are likely futile. She still applies for EOI, but is lied to about why she won't get a an actual role and is stuck forever on the ever-stressful relief-wheel.\n\nNo holiday pay. No sick pay (she forces herself to go when she's unwell because we all need the money), and she cannot get pregnant if she is not provided some sort of job security.. despite wanting children and being pushed to the cusp of capacity (age threshold). After struggling so much to hold down employment, I think she can be forgiven for worrying that she'll lose what she's worked so hard to build, and never be able to return.\n\nDespite everything, through the course of working at this school in a relief capacity only, she has developed an excellent rapport with parents, students and a number of other teachers (with perseverance), as we are greeted with incredible friendliness day in day out as we go about our lives within the local community. She's regarded very highly both personally and and by her peers/colleagues, past and present, the earlier years in other locations.\n\nShe is incredibly humble, and would be absolutely horrified to discover I've made this enquiry, and so publicly, for fear that this could find its way back to the school. She doesn't want to inconvenience anyone, and certainly doesn't want to create waves that could cause further impact on her career, in a strange almost co-dependent relationship she has with the school. Had there been enough work at surrounding schools, she would have taken it, but there isn't, not enough to make ends meet.\n\nWe think something isn't right and that she's being mistreated.\n\nWhat do others think? Is this discrimination? Or is this just the way it is in schools in Australia?\n\nSorry for the novel, and thank you for reading.",

  "selftext": "Hey everyone, new to the sub and have been learning a lot! After finishing a degree that I enjoyed but have realised is not for me career wise, I am moving overseas to teach English in SEA. Long term I'm interested in moving back to Australia to potentially do a masters of teaching in secondary or primary, (will see which age group I enjoy teaching more), especially if other states subsidise the course like they have in VIC (I'm based in QLD). Whilst I'm teaching English overseas Maths would be my subject of choice back home (Did B and C in high school and would enjoy teaching those subjects). Looking into the pre requisites for teaching secondary there seems to be some differences between universities and states in what is required from your previous degree. My completed degree was more practical in nature (audio engineering) and the theoretical stuff I did do was focused on acoustics which from what I have read wouldn't be relevant, at best would it give me 4-5 units in physics, a few in music and not much else. NSW seems pretty clear on requiring 6 subjects/major in a certain field to teach, however QLD education requirements seem unclear. UQs MoT has the 6 unit requirement for any subject you want to specialise in, but Griffith only requires it for Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Psychology. So my question is, are these undergrad prerequisites there for entry for the masters degree, or is it required to be a qualified teacher? Does it vary from state to state? Is there a way to find if certain subjects from your undergrad meet curriculum requirements? I am open to primary teaching as well,Appreciate any input it's hard to find clear info.Cheers.",

He was suspended etc.\n \n\n** Update: upon his return his re entry meeting was handled really, really well by the AP, despite the fact that I’d asked the Prin to attend but he didn’t think it was necessary. It was treated as a pre expulsion meeting due to the amount of suspensions he had previously had, so I was satisfied they were taking it seriously. \n\nHowever the kid decided to come back with an allegation backed by his parents that I had been / said something ‘inappropriate’ to a male student. This was proven to be untrue and was rejected outright at the meeting. \n\nPrior to finding this out, I had forgiven the original incident; kids make mistakes etc, say stupid shit..time to move on etc etc. but when I heard he was falsely accusing me of something that could affect my employment and reputation, I was livid. \n\nOnce he was back, he was advised to not interact with me until we had a restorative and I would decide when I was ready for that. During this time, he would not be in my class. \n\nA few days later, a restorative was organised and I expressed that I had forgiven the cum cakes incident but not the false allegations. Kid doubled down and said he “needed to defend” himself (by falsely accusing me) as he was “nearly expelled.” \nI obviously was not satisfied with this and the conversation ended with nothing resolved. He is still not back in my class which I am grateful for. \n\nAs someone who is known for building excellent relationships with students etc this has really burnt me and will forever change how I interact with them. Kids are changing - over the years, I have found they have less and less accountability, more entitlement and the relationships you build really don’t mean much in the end.

  "selftext": "RANT WARNING .. SORRY. \n\nFor context, I have 3 students in my class who are literally the nightmares of our year 5 cohort. These 3 students have admin wrapped around their fingers and they flaunt it to students and staff. They pick on and beat up special needs students, have trashed mine and other classrooms and vandalised cars, caused several lockdowns, ran out of the school, lit fires .. honestly anything you can imagine … and laugh about it all because they know they won’t get into much trouble over it. \n\nSo now you know about these students, last week we had a field trip to a theme park that almost our whole cohort were attending and excited for. I had told out Deputy and Principal that these 3 students most certainly SHOULD NOT be allowed to come. I knew 100% that they were going to run amuck in some way shape or form, and it would literally impact the whole cohort’s day (who have been fantastic this year and deserved this field trip). Our P.E, Music, Arts and Technologies teachers said several times to our admin that these students should not be allowed to attend … and can you guess what happened? YUP!! All three students were allowed to come, and we were assured they would behave because our Deputy would be with us and personally watch these 3 boys. 10:30 we entered the park, 11:15 the students went off in groups AND BY 12 OCLOCK we were called to all come back to the meeting point because more staff were needed to help look for the 3 boys who had gotten into a fight with another student and run off. \n\n1:30pm, we got these kids back to the cohort … and yes, by the time we got them back to the group, the cohort only had time to go and buy one thing from a food stand or giftshop and get back on the bus … there was a riot, so many students understandably fuming at these 3 boys that had ruined their end of year trip. These boys had to be picked up at the theme park because so many students wanted to get their hands on them. NOW fast forward to this Monday … guess who has emails, phone calls and confrontations at school with fuming parents wanting refunds and answers about what happened last week. Deputy and Principal were absent Mon, Tues and today but sent our year 5 cohort an email booking in a meeting for 3:10pm tomorrow to go over issues and complaints about the field trip AND to go over our planning of the field trip to see what could have been done better AND WHAT WE MISSED .. EXCUSE ME !!!!! you want me to stay behind on the second last day of school for a long meeting to go over what YOU fcked up !!! why can’t you just admit you screwed up? Its so debilitating and depressing to teach in a school where leadership cant pull their finger out.\n\nEdit - when we found out these boys were attending we tried to get their parents to attend with them, the parents declined. The deputy wanted all 3 boys in 1 group and that group of students had 2 teacher aides, a teacher and a parent volunteer as well as the deputy with their group and still got away. ",

  "title": "Complaint about school curriculum delivery?",
  "selftext": "Hi all\n\nSo at my current school (DET high school in VIC) the curriculum delivery is quite complicated, with a lot of issues that leadership has ignored/seem to be ignoring. So in a TLDR version students must do \"core subjects\" this includes general science, maths, English etc from years 7-9. Each of these core subjects run for one semester (i.e. two school terms). Students can then choose electives in each domain, for example science electives, hums electives etc. Each elective runs for one school term. However with the way the curriculum progression is set up, they do not have to choose one compulsory elective from each subject. So for example they can pick a majority of hums and STEAM electives while not picking any science electives. This means that students are actually missing out on large chunks of the curriculum in certain domains, especially in the science domain where they are getting to year 10/11 without having met 2 or more curriculum descriptors. As an example a student in a year 11 chemistry class had NOT done any chemistry at year 10 and was placed into chemistry for year 11, there is no core science program that runs at year 10... The principal has made all students and incoming students sign waivers to accept this curriculum structure claiming that 'it gives them more choice'. Previous staff members have raised the issue with the principal but not many changes were made, the head of teaching and learning raised the issue as well but they were told to stay in their lane and not to focus on the curriculum delivery. So just wanted to know who can a complaint be sent to for action to rectify this? This seems morally wrong as students and families are placing their trust in the school to deliver the curriculum, but the school is failing them. ",

They have just released their interim report ([https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary\\_Business/Committees/Senate/Education\\_and\\_Employment/DASC/Interim\\_Report](https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Education_and_Employment/DASC/Interim_Report)), which reaches the conclusion that we have increasing behavioural problems because teachers don’t know what they’re doing. Their solution is implementing a “behaviour curriculum” and making sure we use “evidence based pedagogy” and will helpfully do this by spoon feeding it all to us all with a centralised bank of resources. That teachers as professionals know how to teach and that extraneous factors are the root cause of increasingly poor behaviour has flown straight over their heads.\n\nIt's extremely insulting to the teaching profession (yet again) that the conclusion of the Australian parliament is that teachers are clueless and don’t know how to teach poorly behaved students unless they \"help us\". The committee seems to be completely uninterested in directing any criticism at themselves for the decades of poor policy that has led to the shitstorm that is teaching in Australia\n\nBeyond the Greens senator who submitted a dissenting report, the Senate committee has not asked itself why, if it thinks the Australian teacher workforce doesn’t know how to teach, their two decades of “accountability”, “efficiency” and “transparency” haven't done the job. I don’t know about you, but if I’d implemented a policy approach for 20-odd years designed to improve education in Australia that clearly isn't working I might spend a bit of time reflecting on that. The fact that the conservative Centre for Independent Studies – the mob that has led the centralised accountability model from the beginning that resulted in this mess – is being posited as having the solutions to the problem tells us all we need to know about the priorities of the Australian Parliament.\n\nHere's some advice for the committee. How about reflecting on the disparate funding situation we have in this country? How about discussing how switching to “schools as businesses and students as customers” has led to a generation of entitled parents and students? How about contemplating a system where schools are pitched to compete against each other to the point principals now spend a fair chunk of their day on marketing and public relations and not on educational leadership? How about giving consideration to the challenges faced in attracting good teachers when governments across Australia keep undermining teacher professionalism?\n\nGovernments can’t keep abdicating blame for their own failures. Kicking teachers around like political footballs won't lead to change. These issues are NOT our fault - it lies entirely with the system they themselves have created.",

I got down to his level and asked him to say it again, he just looked at me with no words then looked down at his own leg as he twisted it around to show me his calf and thigh. A fluorescent shade of mustard liquid had made a trail down his leg and from the stench that accompanied it, I knew this was an atomic wet fart that was going to be a problem. As I scanned around the carpet in the room, I saw sequences of his preceding steps on his way to sharing his dilemma with me. I asked him to quickly move outside as I arranged almost half the chairs in the room to cordon off the crime scene as the rest of the class went mental and complained about the rancid smell. Luckily, a teachers aide arrived to assist with reading so she took the boy to the office and he never returned for the day. The office also promptly dispatched the handyman at the school to come and cover the sludge stains on the carpet with some sort of powder deodoriser. This worked enough to get us through until the first break, then it was cleaned up properly, it was far from the best day l have had by a long shot, but I can laugh about it now.\n\nAnyone else like to share?",

They often complains about not wanting to do the work.\n\nB is the youngest in lower primary school, and so their attention span is quite short and they needs most of the questions read out to them. I can't leave them on their own for very long because they will go out of the program we are doing and find something else to do.\n\nC will do the work and cooperates, but can get distracted by A and B talking to them. I have to say, there's a big difference in the way  they treat authority figures. I feel like I slipped up somewhere with poor classroom management but I don't know how.\n\nD is a high school student and often needs to go over topics again and again. They will do the work with other tutors but with me, they refuse to listen until I break the question down into the tiniest bits. They have done the work a bit better with other tutors, but with me, they will go to the bathroom and my manager has said they were throwing toilet rolls out the window. D will often also laugh at the other kids misbehaving whilst I try to show them how to do the question.\n\nToday was more of a shitshow than usual. I had kids asking me the time and how long until they go home. Kids distracting each other, singing out loud, laughing at each other. The high school kid was not cooperating and laughing at my attempts at behaviour management. I was overwhelmed and grew impatient, and the kids could see that.\n\nI had this one sub in high school who no one liked because she would get extremely agitated and people would laugh at her standoffish nature. I felt I was being like this today and also super incompetent. \n\nI spoke to my manager, who was a primary teacher, and she said it's just that time of the year and I shouldn't worry.

I accepted a full-time, permanent position at a school that's located over two hours away from where I currently am. This was over two months ago. \n\nI was very honest in that I wouldn't be able to accept the position if departmental housing wasn't available, as my finances wouldn't allow me to rent a dog house in this current climate, let alone a property nearby. \n\nThey advised that a local school in another town may have some accommodation for me, for up to six months (which works out – still gives me time to build up some credible ammo to apply for a rental thereafter). They said they'd in contact with the school, and myself to keep me updated. \n\nA while goes by, I'm on dual-PEx so I'm working nine straight weeks at two schools. I still find some time to follow-up with an email. No response. I give them a call. The deputy is on holiday. Okay, cool... \n\nI email one person, they tell me to email somebody else, who says to contact this other person. We're running in circles at this point and nobody seems to care at all. I feel I've just been lied to, essentially, and left stranded with no idea what to do. \n\nForward to now, it's the last week of term, and I decided to call the school that's supposedly offering the housing. Nothing available they tell me. \n\nAt this point, I'm just assuming I'm SOL. I just can't foresee the four hour daily commute to and from work (not to mention the fuel and toll prices), so I will likely need to turn down the position.\n\nSo... How fucked am I? Will I now have to wait until at least term 2 to find another school to take me on? I'm still assuming CRT work will still be fairly easy to obtain (South Gold Coast region)? \n\nThe whole idea of getting this job was to improve my current life situation (life has not been kind to me in the past 2.5 years), and I feel I just can't get a break. I was under the impression I was needed (an IDT teacher left last week, I was taking on all his classes), but yet their actions tell me they don't really seem to care...? \n\nAnyway, apologies for the giant wall of text. I'm just a mixture of frustrated, sad and dejected. \n\nThank you for reading. If anybody could share similar experiences and what you did to combat it, that would be awesome.",

This development led me to ponder a fundamental question about our approach to teacher education.\n\nWhy not consider moving the teaching qualification out of the university context and into TAFE, structured more like an apprenticeship? This shift could potentially offer a more hands-on, practical approach, aligning closely with the realities of the classroom.\n\nApprenticeships typically emphasize in-field experience, which is crucial for teaching. By integrating more in-class time, future teachers could gain valuable on-the-job training, observing and learning directly from experienced educators. This model could also facilitate a smoother transition into the profession, with less of a ‘theory-practice’ gap that new teachers often experience.\n\nI’m curious to hear your thoughts on this.

I was also depressed at the time, and since teaching has a massive reputation for burnout I thought I’d be better off in speech pathology.\n\nSo in 2018 I embarked on my speech pathology degree. I hated my uni years, I found speech pathology disinteresting and I found pracs incredibly stressful. I spent the entire degree in what ifs and seriously considered switching, but I was scared I’d get burnt out in teaching so I never switched. I’m in my first year working as a speechie now as I ended up taking 5 years for my degree. I don’t despise it but I do find it tiring working with young toddlers and high needs kiddos, and I feel really unconfident. I find speech sounds and lisps really difficult, and the only area I really feel confident in and enjoy is teaching literacy. I did start off the year in a toxic workplace which has scarred me a little (where I was working crazy overtime), but have thankfully moved somewhere better. \n\nSometimes I think about going back to uni and becoming a science teacher, but spending another 4 years of my life not working means losing out on a lot of money. I'm already 24 living at home, I don't want to be 28 and still here. \n\nSo, do I give up on my dream? If I had a time machine I 100% would switch, but I want to be realistic about the sacrifice of being a mature aged student. Advice please!",

  "selftext": "Hi all. I have taken on first teaching job. Term 4 on a year 5/6 in a very low socio economic school where I was told there were many behavioural issues. They were right. And I was much to assured that I would be okay. I’m not. The school has no proper behaviour management framework. However our building each have a senior staff member stationed in them. I have now heard the last teacher left due to the student practically throwing a mutiny against her. Telling her to “kill herself” etc but no consequences to those that did it. I was just told that she was a bad teacher. I struggle to get 80% of the students to listen. They just consistently talk and I sit there waiting. I have introduced a seating plan which has sort of worked with reducing some behaviours but I have a group of girls who are constantly ganging up. They talk back, don’t do work and have no respect at all. They patronise when I try to correct their behaviour. I have tried keeping them in break times, sending to senior staff however the students return from being at senior staff with no change. They are often still allowed to go out at lunch after being sent to senior staff and have blatantly told me they don’t care about going.  Any suggestions for my last 11 days ?",

  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI am a secondary school teacher for Singapore and I'm looking into migrating to Australia with my partner and our 2 cats. \n\nOne of my main motivating factors is a better work life balance, higher pay for my partner as she doesn't have a degree in Singapore and if possible, for me not to remain closeted  as a gay person at work my whole life. It's quite sad because teaching is my passion and I'm actually a pretty good performer at work.\n\nFor the past 6 months or so, I've done quite a fair bit of research but there is still a lot unknowns. This is my current situation, I hope that people who are in a similar situation can share more with me. \n\nI am 30 this year and it's not yet 31st bday, so I qualify to apply for the working holiday visa. I was thinking that I can do the 1 year in Australia and see if I can do some CRT work after doing my IELTS and teacher registration in NSW. The purpose of the working holiday visa is for me to scout out life as a teacher in Australia and for me to develop and grow. Hopefully after my experience, I'd be more confident of a more permanent move. \n\nI've also been speaking to migration agents and while I qualify for the skilled migrant visa (189/190/461), I'm not too sure if financially I would be able to support my partner and our cats. The cost of migration agents and our visa would amount to SGD 20k and the cost for moving our cats would be USD 14k. If we choose to go by thus route, I'd probably only be able to make the move in a few years, so that we can save up more. \n\nHere are my concerns, hopefully the collective wisdom on the Internet can shed some light on my predicament. \n\n1) I am concerned on the viability of my subjects to be hired as a permanent teacher. \nWhile I have the eligible teaching qualifications, I've checked that if I register in NSW, I should be able to gain approval to teach only one subject which is Society and Culture. This is because I have a Bachelors in Sociology Honours. \n\nI was wondering if this would severely limit my teaching opportunities for HSIE/HASS roles? \n\n2) I'm wondering about whether I will be able to secure housing for my partner and cats, as I know that renting is quite a stringent process and NSW does not seem very pet friendly. \n\n3) I also have concerns on classroom management as I have a pretty small stature that's even smaller than the average Asian. However, I am a pretty resilient person and throughout my career, I've always given my all to connect with my students. In a slightly toxic way i've always prided myself on being able to turn the defiant teenagers around with kindness and care. (By reaching out to them after school, writing encouraging notes, praising them and speaking to them like adults when they are misbehaving)\n\n4) I'm considering on doing the skilled migrant visa application on my own as I've logged into the portal for AITSL and Immi and I have found it relatively straightforward. Looking to speak with and connect with others who have done the same. \n\n5) For my working holiday visa, I've filled up my form and uploaded the documents since months ago. But as the deadline to apply approaches in a few days, I'm starting to get really cold feet. My colleagues who know me remark that I am doing well and that I'm a great teacher. I'm quite scared to leave a stable job that for an unknown. Maybe you could give me some words of encouragement to help me take the plunge!\n\nThanks all for reading so far and I hope to hear your comments!",

Often posters are downvoted for statements and I'm finding there seems to be a misconception on the funding of private institutions. \n\nFTR private is any school under non-government umbrella. Namely Catholic and Independent (Islamic, Anglican, non-denominational, etc)\n\nPrivate schools get funding from both state and federal.   (It's generally federal that gets reported on as the financial difference is greater). Public schools also get the same funding but at an increased rate. \n\nTiered school may get further finances based  on particular needs but this is determined by the socio economic status (ie low ses schools).   The vast majority of public schools get more funding per student then their private counterpart. \n\nYet the narrative on this sub is a consistent scream of private getting more from state/federal governments. It is simply not true at all. \n\n\nOf course private schools get more money from fees and thus have more access to resources. That of course can and does cause divisions in access to education. That is not the point of this thread. I am discussing the very aggressive minority that clearly dislike anyone teaching in the private system, and the misconception of the funding reality.",

  "selftext": "My son who's in Year 11 has had marks deducted from his assignment because a tool used by his NSW state high school.  The teacher pulled him aside and told him that the software that they're now required to run for AI-plagiarism detection flagged three paragraphs of his assignment as \"100% likelihood that the text was generated by an AI\" so he had his marks reduced as a result.\n\nMy son maintains that he did NOT use chat GPT or any other AI tool. I ran the alleged paragraphs through a number of AI detection tools and NONE of them flagged the text as suspicious. One can skim through the text and quite clearly tell that the language in it doesn't even look like anything an AI language model would generate.\n\nWe took this up with the head teacher who said that the school is being forced (by NESA) to use the tool and that their hands are tied. I asked them to tell me what tool was used but they didn't want to tell me (they only gave me a screenshot showing that the text was supposedly 100% AI generated).\n\nThe Head Teacher even said that my son is lucky to not have gotten a zero because that's what the principal reckoned should've happened and that he was 'lucky' he wasn't in year 12 because otherwise it'd have been an automatic fail.\n\nThis comes as quite a kick in the guts for my son because he actually loves the subject in question, he's working hard and is engaged in it but feels that the school system has let him down and is blindly relying on advice from an AI tool to determine how papers should be marked.\n\nWe've requested a meeting with the principal tomorrow and I'm wondering if any of you teachers out there have any ideas as to what we could do? I've already emailed the school a number of screenshots showing that the assignment was not picked up as AI by multiple detection tools but they didn't want to hear any of it.\n\nIs this what NESA is really imposing now or is this BS from the school?",

Just this last week 2 teachers at my school (one was an experienced casual) came to school wearing leggings. Not with a skirt or long shirt even, butt exposed fully!! Also, the office staff frequently wear jeans. Joggers are worn frequently by staff. I guess it’s up to the principal to say something and there is a teacher shortage so we can kind of get away with things but has anyone else noticed this? It’s boggling my mind! 😆\n\nEDIT: Wow 🤩 Amazing responses everyone. Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Just to clarify, I have nothing against casual clothes for work I just think it’s interesting how expectations have changed in the last few years. When I said “joggers” I did mean sports shoes.

I might rant so I can't blame you.\n\nSo I come from industry, Boilermaker of over 16 years on repairs of heavy marine services and equipment (oil rigs and oil ships etc) I really loved my job but was sick of the travel and 4 years ago I saw an advert for teaching a Cert II in Engineering Studies and got the job. \nWent to TAFE got my TAE and got PTT. \nOn my first day I was thrown in and learnt to swim (or would have sunk). Honestly completly different to industry! So much support from so many of the staff it was absolutely amazing! I felt like I'd worked there for years after the first week. The Assistant Prin was amazing! He covered the trade area and was from trade himself! Honestly I thought this was it! It's been the best ride and being apart of the success, growth and achievement of (\"some\" let's be honest its not all of em) students, honestly it feels weird to say but it was a fucking rush!\n\nThen come university. My experience and time in industry meant not much unfortunately, credit for about 6 months of my degree. The fact I was teaching also? Nothing.\nI had to attend part time as working in industry meant I had a life and needed a full time job. The requirement of university and hours needed for study, reading and writing... It was 15+ hours a week for the units (I'm a tradie cut me some slack haha)\nEnd of last year it came time to do my first prac, and I was told it can't be paid.\nComming from over $130k a year to $87k THEN being told I have 2 weeks with no pay... I had to defer the unit as honestly my family wouldn't cope and I had a decision.\nContinue and struggle more or leave and fix my financial problems.\n\nSo I've spent the whole of Term 1 applying for positions within schools like VET Coordinators and the like with no success. So I went with what I know. I'm going back to industry. I'm lucky that it's in construction, so awsome pay, but I'll also be home every night too.\nI love boilermaking so I'm not sad about that, but I'm sad about losing a job I really loved..\n\n(this might be the rant part) but I'm even more sick of the unrealistic expectation that was placed upon me in my degree. I could continue in TAFE or uni with my current qualifications, but I need even more for a high school teahcer (teaching a lower level certificate)\nI'm sick of not having the job securities teachers enjoy because every 3 years I have to re-apply for my PTT. \nIm sick of my pay being capped at $92k for the next 6 years while I complete a degree and accumulate debt. \n\nHonestly the reason I am leaving is I refuse to go back to uni. I refuse to gain a debt to get a job, when I have a full 4 year qualification (plus another 12+ years of experience) and can earn an extra 30k back on the tools overnight without even trying (I know cause I am) \n\nSo yeah.\nI know it was a rant and I know this will change nothing and I'm ok with that.\nI'm excited for my next steps and super excited to be back on the tools.\nI am however super sad that I'll be leaving a job I really loved and I really hope things will maybe change but until then I wish everyone the best! I'll keep watching :)\n\n\nTL:DR: I loved teaching and had the best job, but I didn't like uni so I'm going back to trade which I am excited for also.. So I resigned today. Oh and more money.. Yay.",

  "selftext": "Preface: I am not a teacher, but a parent.  I would appreciate your perspective.\n\nI have one child in Year 8 at a QLD public high school, and a second child who will start high school next year.  Our school offers a BYOD program, however the Apple iPad is the only device which meets the BYOD requirements.  I have some concerns, and would appreciate your thoughts before I lobby the school to change this policy:\n\n1. Given that very few people use an iPad as their primary computing device for work, Uni or TAFE, I'm concerned that we might be setting these kids up for failure. I feel they would be better off working in the environment (OS) they're most likely to use once they leave high school.\n\nTransitioning from iOS to (most likely) Windows would be a much steeper learning curve than vice-a-versa.\n\n2. As my children have a laptop for primary school, we, like many parents, will have to purchase another device, if our kids are to be part of the program. (Participation in the BYOD program is optional, but encouraged).\n\n3. The parental controls on iOS are inferior to Windows 10/11. As an example. On their current (Win10) device, I can set limits for each day of the week, as well as limits for each application, along with the usual content filtering etc.\n\nThe iOS parental controls are much more ‘broad strokes’. Monitoring screen time and the content that our children consume / interact with is important to us, and it’s very difficult on iOS devices in comparison to Windows OS.\n\n4. Working exclusively from an iPad, in my experience, is much less efficient. Not that school should be all about maximising efficiency, but if you're futzing with margins or trying to get formula's to work in Excel, you're distracted from the content, it takes much longer and it can be frustrating.\n\nI don’t know anyone who would tackle a research assignment on an iPad.\n\n5. Why are public school mandating the devices and software (and eco system) of a single (not-Australian) manufacturer? Particularly a manufacturer notorious for their anti-competitive practices, and which has actively resisted consumer's right to repair their own devices.\n\n6. The limited connectivity and software compatibility inhibits STEM applications - whilst learning a programming language like Python might technically be possible, I feel it would be much more difficult in iOS. And how would you connect to an Arduino, a 3D Printer, a sound mixer and video camera, etc.\n\nHow does the teaching community feel about this?\n\nEdit:\n\n7.  I appreciate that having only 1 device such as the iPad would make connectivity easier.  I would offer 2 counterpoints: a) the later Windows OS is much better than it used to be, and b) this is an opportunity to teach the kids how to troubleshoot (you know... in your spare time)\n\n&#x200B;",

We have a couple of students who are trans or nonbinary and one of my questions was, where do they sleep? \n\nThe suggestion came up that these two students could share a cabin. One has very recently transitioned to female and the other is gender X (they/them) who was a 'she' until last year.\n\nNormally, schools don't let Year 9 boys and girls sleep in the same cabin on camp. I was surprised by this suggestion as, although they have a different gender identity, these two students still have opposite sex organs. I'd have thought it would be a hard 'no' but the DP seemed to think this would be possible with parent approval. \n\nIt appeared that the DP was very keen to be gender-affirming and so would be seeking to arrange whatever the students say they prefer, while requiring parental consent for all students involved. \n\nMy own position is that the risk of (potentially) facilitating a teen pregnancy greatly worries me, and that we can be gender-affirming while also avoiding the potential for things to go pear-shaped in that particular direction. Although it's not my call at this point, have other schools tackled this issue? Is this the norm now?\n\n\nEDIT: As this discussion draws to a close, a couple of themes have emerged: \n1. There's broad agreement that the best thing is to discuss with the students where they'd be most comfortable, and to take it from there; \n2. that this decision should be part of a coherent policy that ultimately rests with school leadership (i.e. don't just make it up as you go along)\n\nA few posts point out that teenagers will find a way to get up to shenanigans regardless of school rules, and of course I do already realise this. This post was more about considering the optics of the situation, and potential worst-case scenario (which we're all expected to consider in the risk assessment process). A part of me is still surprised that mixed cabins are  now a done thing, but I realise the reasons. Still, I'm glad that this decision will ultimately rest with school leadership, it's outside my experience and above my pay grade.",

  "title": "Very disadvantaged school, average private school, or stretch for expensive private school?",
  "selftext": "Just as the title says, we've got to figure out what school to send our kiddo to next year. We live in a rural area and our options aren't great. I am so torn, confused and emotional about it.\n\nThe school we're zoned for is in the 4th percentile for ICSEA and the NAPLAN results are pretty bad, 69% of its students are in the bottom quarter for socio-economic advantage. The classrooms and  seem great though and new principal who started 2 years ago seems very evidence-based and intent on turning things around. They've just rolled out Walker learning for k-2 for example.\n\nThere's a local private school which is cheap at 2K a year. It's very religious (prayers every day, religious stuff everywhere) and we are not at all. The classrooms are tiny (in one this year they have 30 kindergartners, in a room with only enough space for the desks, and 2 teachers) and they don't seem to do  much play based learning. Approach feels dated. The sole motivator people in our area seem to have for sending kids there is to get your kid away from the poors which feels terrible. Only 18% of its students are in the bottom quarter for SEA and its 67th percentile for ICSEA. Its naplan results are good (for our area).\n\nFinal option is an expensive private school in the town over. Would mean 35 min drive each way and kindy is $6500 a year. Only 6% of its students are in the bottom quarter for SEA, its ICSEA is 84th percentile (1099) and they seem very modern and evidence based on teaching. Its naplan results are great. This school is a religious one but only has as much religious study time as our local public does, no prayers, no parafernalia about.\n\nOur oldest kiddo is very sensitive and quiet so I'm really worried how he'd go at the local public but we are also expecting a third child right before school starts so spending 2 hours in the car driving to the exxy private school is going to be really tough. With 3 kids it will also be pretty tight financially. It will mean I need to work more and it will mean sacrifices on life experiences we could have given them (luxuries like holidays, tutors if they need them, extra curriculars, less for birthdays etc, even just savings for them as adults).  Obviously aware of the privilege inherent in even having this option and in the sacrifices we're thinking about (i.e food on the table wouldn't be the issue). I'm am worried about the financial stress we'd be bringing into our lives, perhaps without necessity.\n\nA final note is that our oldest is (probably) autistic, level 1. He's definitely not 'autistic enough' that we'll get funding past the age of 7 (you need to be level 2 or greater) but I can see classroom disturbance/noise being an issue for him potentially. Local public school has a very large population of special needs students and is really setup for it.\n\nI'm very interested in a teacher's perspective on what are the most important aspects to consider. We've toured all 3 schools and should have a place at each thanks to early waitlisting. If we pass up the spot at the expensive school we may not get another chance as there are no official spots available again till year 5 and then it goes on grades etc rather than waitlist position.\n\nAll the schools are small for primary (about 200 students) and have similar teacher to student ratios (about 15-20 students to 1 teacher). \n\nEdited to add our suburb is one of the top 10 most disadvantaged in the state, and one of the worst for drug/alcohol/gambling. I personally would not consider public high school here at all (really high dropout rates, teen pregnany, violence etc here).\n\nScreenshot of all the numbers attached.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hx1plavwqjua1.jpg?width=732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8744f16d62059b3d9ae48079c3a42d461c85636",

Days were long and tough at times but the day to day classroom was made much easier. Most of these are inner city London or other U.K. city schools, that have some of the most disadvantaged students, but also the best behaviour. It actually helps with developing strong relationships with the students as well which some teachers tend to think otherwise. \n\nI don’t agree with everything Katherine Birbalsingh says (especially on her politics) but her school is top of the list and ultimately gets the best outcomes for her students. Any leaders who seems to be struggling how to improve behaviour in their school, contact some of these inner city schools in the U.K. and ask them what they do.",

It's definitely not the prettiest of apps but it is very highly rated. Anyway, below is an email I've been sending out. Feel free to ask any questions. There's a trending fb post about it in the ChatGPT for teachers group here: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/703007927897194/posts/777522040445782/](https://www.facebook.com/groups/703007927897194/posts/777522040445782/)\n\n**Create AI report comments - use with our free reports app**\n\n**Details here:** [**https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php**](https://schoolreportwriter.com/chatgpt-bard-ai-report-comments.php)\n\nYou may have heard about the potential of ChatGPT and Google's AI Bard to transform the way you create student reports. However, using ChatGPT and Bard on their own can be time-consuming, as they require you to input a lot of student-specific details. That's why we've come up with a game-changing solution: combining the AI power of ChatGPT and Bard with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, SchoolReportWriter.COM\n\n**How it works:**\n\n**(1)** Start by instructing ChatGPT or Bard to produce general report comments suitable for your course and year group, with #N as a placeholder for the student's name, and male pronouns (see male pronouns note below).\n\n**For example**, you could instruct ChatGPT or Bard like this: \"*Generate ten sentences for a teacher's reports to parents, less than 500 characters each, for Art students aged 13-15. Student name placeholder #N. Use male pronouns.*\"\n\n**Male pronouns note**: To avoid ambiguity, ask ChatGPT or Bard to use male pronouns when creating comments. \"Her\" can be unclear since it could refer to either \"her/him\" or \"her/his\". When you paste the comments into our app, we will automatically replace male pronouns with placeholders. Later, when creating reports, you can choose female, male, or neutral pronouns.\n\n**(2)** Next, copy and paste the ChatGPT or Bard comments into your comment bank, at School Report Writer dot COM. You can also use the thousands of pre-written comments available on this site to add more variety to your reports.\n\n**(3)** Finally, you can quickly create custom report paragraphs for each student with our free and highly-rated teacher reports app, by selecting relevant comments from the comment bank.\n\nAll the best, Linden",

The suggested and implemented changes so far are weak in the face of a real crisis and fail to fix the root cause. This crisis is not new, and therefore, because it is not new and we still have no real improvement for teachers, gives me pause. Who's to say it will improve within the next 5 or so years? They can talk all they want about the issues, but the fixes put forward are much too weak .  \n\nFor example, if 0 is baseline for teacher experience, neither good, nor bad, and we are collectively at say -10 (which has resulted in the crisis), any changes they seem to have suggested will do nothing to get close to 0, let alone make it appealing for people to switch into teaching or attract them out of high school.

This development led me to ponder a fundamental question about our approach to teacher education.\n\nWhy not consider moving the teaching qualification out of the university context and into TAFE, structured more like an apprenticeship? This shift could potentially offer a more hands-on, practical approach, aligning closely with the realities of the classroom.\n\nApprenticeships typically emphasize in-field experience, which is crucial for teaching. By integrating more in-class time, future teachers could gain valuable on-the-job training, observing and learning directly from experienced educators. This model could also facilitate a smoother transition into the profession, with less of a ‘theory-practice’ gap that new teachers often experience.\n\nI’m curious to hear your thoughts on this.

I'm thinking of giving myself a timeframe of around 2-3 years to make this happen because I have some things to sort out first.\n\nAs a bit of background, I have ADHD and I hated being at school even though I was academically gifted, because I felt constrained by the curriculum. I realise that teachers also have the same restriction regarding the curriculum, but at the same time I can sympathize with students who hate school due to boredom.\n\nOk so after that preamble here's what I am thinking of doing:\n1. Undertake a secondary teaching program with a scholarship - I know there's Teach for Australia and Teach NSW but I haven't looked into the details yet. Some people here said TFA is bad but didn't explain why.\n2. Undertake the minimum contracted teaching period - I think I read someone's comment that with TFA you have to sign a 3 year contact? Correct me if I'm wrong.\n3. Switch to teaching part-time or casual - this is because I want to pursue another career on the side. I'm thinking of doing a post-graduate research degree (in a field I'm interested in) or creative writing or both. I need to keep myself mentally stimulated or else my mental health goes downhill.\n4. Pursue opportunities to teach overseas down the track - I always wanted to travel and live in different countries. I think potentially I'd like to be able to teach in a university. If I have a masters or PhD, plus secondary teaching experience, it should increase my chances of getting the job that I want. (I know teaching high school is not the same as teaching university but hopefully some skills are transferable.)\n\nDo you think this is feasible, and what do you think are the pros and cons?\n\nI know it sounds like a lot to take on but when I'm interested in something I can hyperfocus and get it done. It's boring, tedious tasks that make me question the meaning of life.\n\nThank you for your time.",

  "selftext": "First off I'm not an Australian teacher. I'm a parent with two kids in primary school in NSW (kindergarten and year 3). I've read the sidebar rules and I think it's okay to ask this but sorry in advance if I'm encroaching on your space.\n\nMy question. Report cards came out yesterday. I've always wondered about how to read them. I've googled it and got this [unofficial article](https://oldmatemedia.com/understanding-school-report-card-guide-nsw-australia/) which seems good. It basically says most kids will get Cs for everything and that's normal and expected. It's unusual to get a B or A and if most kids were getting those it means the syllabus isn't correct.\n\nIs that correct? Out of a class of 20 kids would the majority be getting Cs across the three subtopics for Maths and English?\n\nI guess my default assumption is that a C isn't a good grade. The only easily accessible source really explaining it says it's actually fine and normal and anything above that is exceptional. There's no official source, that I can see, that says that though.\n\nFor my kindergarten child. There are no A-E grades rather \"working above\",\"working at expected level\" and \"working towards\". One thing I don't get is he got a \"working at expected level\" for \"Compares the mass of objects using the language light and heavy\". Would that be because it's not really possible to get a working above at that or because sometimes he hasn't shown understanding of light and heavy. I ask because he seems to be totally on top of that.\n\nAnyway, I hope I've judged this subreddit correctly and this type of question is allowed. If not please ignore and thanks in advance for any insight anyone can give.",

Over the course of my teaching career, I’ve had the privilege of working with over 3000 Queensland children and their families.\n\nNow, as a Senator for Queensland and the Australian Greens Spokesperson for Schools, I’m fighting to save our public school system. \n\nI’d love you to join our online Town Hall meeting at 6.30pm on Thursday, 31 August, to learn about the state of school funding in Australia and hear an update on the Greens’ campaign to **save our public schools.**. \n\nCome along to find out how under Labor and the Coalition Australia’s school system increasingly rewards the rich and punishes the less well-off – and discover how **you can help the Greens pressure governments to act**.\n\nAcross Australia, public schools are in crisis. Every year, governments short-change public schools $6.5 billion. In the decade since the Gonski review, **government funding to private schools has increased at double the rate of public schools**.\n\nToday, 98% of public schools do not receive their minimum funding – yet 98% of private schools are overfunded. **It makes no sense**.\n\n**The Greens are pushing** the Commonwealth and states and territories to deliver **100%** of the Schooling Resource Standard – better known as the “Gonski” minimum funding level – **to all public schools by January 2025**, the start of the next national funding agreement.\n\nAustralia now has one of the most privatised school systems in the world. It’s a system that heaps privilege onto a fortunate few, while robbing millions of disadvantaged kids of their futures.\n\n**But it doesn’t have to be that way!**\n\nLabor is in government federally and in every mainland state and territory. **They could end this crisis tomorrow** by closing the funding gap and ensuring every Australian child has the education they need and deserve.\n\nCome hear more about how we got here and the Greens’ plan at our virtual Town Hall on **Thursday, August 31**. Ask any questions you have and find out how you can help!\n\n**Register now for this important event. Hope to see you there.**\n\nhttp://www.greens.org.au/schoolstownhall\n\nIn solidarity, \n\nPenny",

But this question is as a parent, I hope that is ok.\n\nPre-Covid, I would keep him home for something like gastro or theoretically flu (though he has never had flu) but for a cold only a couple of days.  And of course as I worked in education I worked sick all the time, unless again it was gastro or flu. But times have changed and many people now don't go to work sick or send their kids to school sick.\n\nSo now I keep my kid home whenever he has a cold, and have done ever since Covid hit. And I don't go to work sick either, which has cost me a lot of money but that's ok.\n\nAnyway, no teacher has had a problem with it but this year, he actually hasn't missed nearly as much school so far as last year but he missed a few days last term, and then early this term he missed a couple of days and the teacher messaged me asking if he was ok, and the subject line mentioned attendance, though the teacher didn't directly say that his attendance was an issue it still made me feel like they had a problem with him missing a couple of days of school. So I replied saying yeah he is sick but he will be ok, and they replied saying no worries they were just worried about him. Which I found odd, there's no reason to worry about a kid missing a couple of days of school. Kids get sick a lot. She is pretty old-school.\n\nI don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into it but it made me feel like they want kids to be going to school even when they are sick, and I mean if parents didn't send their sick kids to school then they wouldn't get all the other kids sick and I am medically vulnerable so I don't really want them to be encouraging kids to attend school sick.\n\nI was just wondering if there is any reason why they would have sent me that message and teachers' thoughts. I certainly don't want to send him in sick, not only so he won't infect children but so he won't infect his teacher and I hate how people don't care about teachers being exposed to sickness.\n\nYou're all amazing.\n\nEdited to add: I always let the school know when he will be away, but I haven't directly messaged the teacher.

  "selftext": "I'm a 4th year BEd student with my final prac to go before graduation and currently working as a temporary language teacher on PTT for most of the term. The school I'm in has a very supportive colleagues, but I have a couple of classes which are highly challenging, to say the least. I have kids with learning difficulties, possibly ADHD, attention seekers, and a host of other issues, and it takes forever to get the lesson started. I'm losing all the other kids while trying to deal with the loud kids in the front. The previous teacher seemed to have had been pretty relaxed with rules, so my attempts to enforce them have not gone well, with the louder kids questioning every instruction I make, which takes even more time from actual teaching.\n\nAs a new educator, I already don't have many strategies for behaviour management, and I'm running out of ideas. I've tried using rewards, using the school's student support system, changing teaching style from devices to paper, with very little success. Teachers have suggested to me to build relations with and get to know the kids, but I'm only here for the term and we're already heading towards assessments, so I feel like there's so little time for it. The story goes for much longer, but tldr, I'm pretty much at the end of my stamina and it's only week 3. This whole experience is making me question my ability and stamina for teaching, and while I'm going to finish my degree, I don't know if I am really suited to become a teacher. My mental health is being affected and I feel like I've just wasted the last 4 years. I would appreciate any advice or suggestions to help me get through the term.",

  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nMy friend and I are thinking of starting a blog, which would involve teaching advice from a psychological perspective. \n\nShe is currently working as a psychologist in a school, and I am an English teacher with a background in philosophy and psychology.\n\nI've included the opening blog below, and am just wondering what your thoughts are/if you'd read?\n\nThanking you!\n------------------------------------\nWe’ve all had them. Back in the day, and yes it does pain me to use that expression as it’s a morose reminder of my own age, some of were even them.\n\nYou know who I’m talking about – the students who, when locked in a classroom, act like kittens on catnip, storms in a teacup, a piece of food that’s stubbornly stuck just where your tongue can’t get to it. But, when that bell goes, or when you haphazardly bump into them down the street, they are demure, polite, and even likeable and, dare I say, excited to see you.\n\nLast year, one of my students attracted trouble with a worrisome compulsivity. Due to bouts of in-class physical violence against other students, name-calling, and a stubborn refusal to complete the set work, he would frequent the coordinators office, parents would be called, and he would show apparent remorse for his actions, only to them repeat them almost straight away.\n\nHe was a moth drawn to a flame, and in this case, the flame was his social group; a particularly toxic group of boys whose idea of friendship involved goading each other.\n\nAt the end of the year, this student decided that the school wasn’t the right place for him, and he withdrew to attend a smaller rural school, where he could get a new start.\n\nWhen he came to say goodbye to me, he apologized for his actions and attitudes throughout the year. We spoke about how he knew that he had fallen into bad habits, and that he had impulse control issues, and how all these problems were exacerbated by the social setting he had put himself in.\n\nI shook his hand, thanked him, and explained something that has, since then, become somewhat of a mantra for me:\n \n“You are a good kid, but a bad student”.\n\nAs those words tumbled between his ears, a look of reflective clarity coalesced onto his face. He smiled at me, thanked me, and said, in his words, that ‘that described [him] perfectly’.\n\nSince then, I’ve used the saying more and more, in different situations and with different people. I’ve found that it almost universally applies to any difficult, trouble-prone student, but too often we confuse the two.\n\nThat’s the ethos of this blog, to help you better understand how to understand your students. This doesn’t mean that you’ll reach all of them, or even some of them, and the ones you do reach will, just like we adults do, relapse into painful and distributive behaviors sometimes, but it is through understanding we grow, and we help our students grow, not into better students because let’s be honest, school isn’t for all of them, but into better people.\n\nAnd in my opinion, growing into better people will always be more important. all,",

There were about 60 or so students sitting in groups along that side of the school grounds, and I think almost every single one of them had their head down looking at their phone. These were students sitting in lunch groups, clearly friendship groups, but zero interaction was happening in any of them. \n\nI was shocked to see this and just so sad for them. The teacher was roaming on duty so clearly it’s just an acceptable thing at that school. Is this normal?? I knew phones had become more common in high schools due to tech in the classroom. But what are your school’s playground policies? \n\nIt is so important kids learn to talk to each other. It’s really quite concerning if they aren’t getting that in break times. \n\n(And I realise there were probably kids on the other side of the playground playing footy and whatnot, but still this was A LOT of students just sitting there on their phones on this side I drove past)\n\nUPDATE: thanks everyone for your input on this. It is obviously a really complex issue which I always knew, it just took me by surprise how accepted it seems now. Some have agreed with my take and others not, which just shows how hard it must be for schools to get right too. I suppose this post shows how often I’ve stepped inside a high school recently!

There's a lot of awesome educators on this subreddit, with a wealth of experience, who are welcoming to newcomers and provide great advice.\n\nBut there's a small section of people here who - I don't know how else to put it, but they don't actually seem interested in understanding how kids learn. They know how they WISH kids would learn, with compliance and good manners and genuine enthusiasm, but they aren't actually interested in understanding why that doesn't always happen.\n\nI've seen a lot more comments of late, particularly in discussions around school refusal, regarding 'tough love' and kids needing to 'suck it up.' Sometimes even from people who *acknowledge* the reality of severe mental health problems children can go through, yet at the same time they seem to believe that there's this secret section of school refusers who somehow don't have mental health problems. \n\nI work in a program specifically designed for kids who are school refusers. All of them - without fail - have severe trauma and mental health issues. All of them - without fail - have been told to toughen up, by their teachers in mainstream settings. It did not help. It made them exponentially worse. \n\nIt's not just school refusal - I've also seen a lot of comments that seem just, generally dismissive of any psychological or developmental reasons for poor behaviour. I definitely get having a shit day at work and coming here for a vent, so to be clear I'm not talking about venting posts. I'm talking about general discussions that devolve into 'some kids are just dropkicks, can't be helped.' \n\nSomeone will write an in-depth comment about brain development with heaps of sources and recommendations for how to curb maladaptive behaviours, but because those measures aren't punitive, they get dismissed. I really do understand the frustration of student misbehaviour - I get sworn at every single day, and when I say sworn at, I mean screamed in my face. What I don't understand is why, outside of that setting, among our fellow adults, we can't put our personal feelings aside to discuss how to actually change these behaviours without constantly devolving into 'kick 'em out' 'Saturday detention' 'hold them back a year.' (And I say this as someone who doesn't believe in grouping by age!)\n\n\nI guess this has turned into a little bit of a vent, which is ironic. And I don't want anyone to feel they can't have a vent on a bad day, and finish off with 'btw I don't want to discuss solutions. I'm in the feelings stage' lol. But one thing that I think would be nice for the state of the subreddit, is if we don't dismiss our fellow teachers *trying* to offer solutions or discuss non-punitive measures for the kids in *non-venting* posts.\n\nETA: Genuinely confused about all the \"I'm not a psychologist\" type comments ... why did you think your course made you study child development if not to understand the psychology of children?",

  "selftext": "Hi Guys!\n\nNot sure if this is the most amazing place to post this, but I'm looking for advice as a student, who is looking to implement policies within my school regarding how staff and teachers educate in our diverse society. \n\nBit of background, I am part of the leadership/captain team at a Catholic high school in Melbourne, I myself am an African female, but born in Australia and am in Year 12.  As part of my leadership, I am attempting to create a set of policies that allow students to report/speak out when they feel like their ethnic, sexual or gender identity/background is not represented in teaching. Eg. in recent years there has been a rise in implementing books not authored by the traditional white male, we've seen rise in female as well as authors who aren't white being implemented into the English curriculum (famous example, The Longest Memory by Fred D'Aguir.) Some of these books often touch on issues regarding on identity, for example the TLM incorporates slavery and heavily uses the N-word. My idea is to create a set of policies that involves a sort of mediation committee of four members, typically counsellors, LSO's and learning diversity officers. This can help students understand how we assess and understand how this effects learning, how this shapes our own identity as well as how we can work with teachers to teach them how this may be damaging. This is in no way a way to reprimand or slap teachers on this wrist, and is instead trying to foster a positive learning community. \n\nI'm looking for advice on whether you guys think this infringes on a teachers right to teach, as well as how it infringes on your lesson plans. Do you guys feel like the implementation of a committee like this may make teachers too scared to teach? Also, how do you believe I can widen these policies to cover other minority groups without infringing on peoples personal beliefs (eg. the teaching of abortion as 'wrong', or the teaching of LGBTQ+ members being 'wrong'?) Furthermore, what are your thoughts on these personal opinions in the classroom? Many believe the n-word has a place in classrooms, or that abortion is 'wrong' and should be taught that way since they are the teacher, do you guys think this is the right method of teaching?\n\nFinally, how do I make this idea receptive to the teachers, I understand how it may seem accusatory and damaging the fabric of teachers, however I've tried to make it as harmless as possible and mostly about reeducation within the school rather than punishment. I've also tried to include that this policy would limit workplace conversations between coordinators and subject teachers about issues like this, which could also damage the fabric of the workplace.\n\nInclude any advice and thoughts you may have, TIA!\n\nEDIT*** Want to make it clear that this is not an oppurtunity for students to come up and say my culture is not represented, That is an issue larger then I can take on. My attempt is too combat students who are of an ethnic group which a teacher is disrespecting***",

Whether it's witnessing a student's \"aha!\" moment, creating a fun and engaging lesson, or simply being there to support our students when they need it most, these are the experiences that remind us why we chose this path.\n\nLet's also remember to support and uplift one another. Teaching can sometimes be overwhelming, but together, we are a strong community that can overcome any obstacle. Share your experiences, ask for advice, and offer a kind word or two to your fellow educators here. We're all in this together!\n\nLastly, take care of yourselves, both physically and mentally. Remember to prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and seek support when needed. You're doing amazing work, and you deserve to recharge and nurture your own well-being.\n\nThank you for everything you do as teachers.

How they worked/work in some parts of the states is that instead of a school being funded, parents get a voucher to send them to an institute of their choice. \n\nOn it's face that doesn't sound so bad, until you look at how it's being pushed over in the states, creates segregated schools, and reinforces the idea that we're factory workers and students are the product. I'm just worried that since Australia seems to be politically about 5-10 years behind where the US is at in any given time, we might see an introduction to that sort of thing over here. \n\nI'd be interested in hearing some more informed opinions though since I've only been in the industry 3 years now, so people with a better understanding of how things shift over time probably have a better understanding.",

Montesorri or perhaps an independent private school.\n\nDoes anyone out there in teacherland know how I can find out that sort of information?\n\nThanks\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nThanks to everyone who replied. I don't think she needs a special school as her learning ability is high enough that entry into a mainstream highschool was taken for granted. She doesn't struggle with learning (far from it actually, she is quite gifted in that sense). It's mainly the size and noise of her current school that really upset her. She is the sort of kid that will sit quietly all day reading and prefers to not interact with other students. She just wants to be left alone to study.\n\nI guess it's early days yet and as the year unfolds, she may find a way to overcome her problems. Her current school is being as supportive as they can.

  "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nJust after some opinions here. People I know have always said that public school students turn out to be better learners at tertiary study etc whereas private school students struggle because they have been \"spoon fed everything\". I have seen similar sentiments reflected on this subreddit. \n\nI am just asking because based on my own public school experience about 15 years ago at a fairly crap public school I know this not to be true. I found high school and the senior ATAR years really easy and flew by achieving a pretty good ATAR. I enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts in my first year of Uni and boy did I struggle and achieved terrible marks. I went onto do a Master of Teaching after majoring in English in my Arts degree. I remember my peers would get really good marks - particularly in that first year - and didn't struggle as much as me. Upon speaking to them, most of them were private school educated. They said that they had done similar things to this in Year 12 in our first year politics subjects etc. \n\nAs another example, in my first year I tried French having done French from Years 7-12. I lasted about a week in French because it was so hard and everyone else in the class spoke perfect French also having done it at high school. I didn't have a French teacher for almost 3 years in high school because they couldn't find one and one that I had for about 2 years would just show us French movies with English subtitles for every class for basically the whole two years. Needless to say I didn't learn anything from that. \n\nJust wondering what other people's experiences were at public or private schools as a student and their transition to tertiary education? Or what they reckon overall based on their experience as a teacher too? Not much point to this post other than seeing what other people reckon. \n\nThanks.",

I achieved what my parents wanted of me anyway.\nIn my 20s I discovered travel and lived for 2 years in a non-english speaking country.

I imagine that i’m probably typical of someone my age in my mid 30s with a mortgage and a young family. However, i’m not satisfied with my chosen career path. I’m a retail manager. For the last 5 years or so, I have been thinking about studying to be a teacher, and these days the options to study are far greater than they were 15 years ago for someone in a regional area.  My favourite part of my job is passing on knowledge and coaching others.\n\nSo after that bit of background information. Would you recommend someone with my background to take on part time study for the next 8 years to hopefully become a teacher in my late 30s early 40s?\n\nSome of my concerns are a drop in work-life balance and my earning capacity of a teacher, especially starting out 8 years from now when my current taxable income is about 77k.\n\nAppreciate any advice.",

They had 24 periods of Year 12, 12 periods of juniors.\n\nIn Term 4, they changing to work part-time (3 days a week). Their timetable has been changed to accommodate this and the needs of the school.\n\nThe new timetable includes 15 periods of classes and 11 periods of \"On-call\" (possible Meadowbanks) to total 26.\n\nSome questions:\n\n* Is this correct, or should they only be allowed to have 12 periods of juniors + meadowbanks where Year 12 fell? \n* I am assuming the change in employment impacts this? \n* Is there an easy way to figure out the allocations based on days working? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

How do early childhood, primary and secondary teaching compare in terms of pay, hours, stress levels and work-life balance?\n\n2. Are there subjects that you can teach without a teacher qualification? I know music teachers don't need a Bachelor of Education which baffles me. I knew a primary school music teacher who was self-employed on an ABN and she worked for a company that contracted her out to a couple of schools for one day a week. She had a Bachelor of Music and no teaching qualifications.\n\n3. How does contracting work? I know another teacher who is a primary school foreign language teacher who is employed full-time by a languages association, and she is contracted to teach at a primary school full-time. (She is a fully qualified primary school teacher though.) Are there any advantages to this sort of arrangement versus being a government employee? Is the pay better? Is there less bureaucracy? Or is there a double layer of bureaucracy?\n\n4. Is Teach for Australia worth it? I had a look at their website and it confuses me. They don't even have an email address I can send questions to. Can you choose any subject areas you want to teach or does it have to be related to your original qualifications?\n\n5. What is the best way (as in fastest and cheapest) to become a teacher? I am specifically interested in social sciences and languages but is it better to qualify in something more \"useful\" like maths or English? One of the reasons I want to go into teaching is because I'm interested in the humanities (history, geography, anthropology) and would like to transfer knowledge to the younger generation. I have an Asian cultural background and I think there is a shocking lack of knowledge in Australia of Asian society, culture and history, which is ironic considering our geographical proximity to our nearest continental neighbour. I'd like to change that.\n\n6. How badly behaved are kids these days? I keep hearing horror stories but I remember kids being mostly well behaved when I was at school (even in low income areas) and teaching seemed really cruisy. Although that was over two decades ago.",

The load I was given for this year wasn't great at all, pretty much most of the year 8 classes that nobody wanted to teach. I was also given a VCE science subject to replace a staff member who left the school. So I have more experience in teaching years 10-12, and it's my personal preference to continue that over teaching years 7-9 and as such I gave my preferences for years 10-12 to my domain leader. But for next year I have mostly been given years 7-9, with one year 10 class. I guess I'm frustrated as they didn't really try to give me a couple more 10-12, and even took away my VCE class. I am not relishing the idea of teaching 7-9 next year, especially with a lot of this group of students having behavioural issues at this particular school, and also it doesn't really excite me. I'm not sure whether to stick it out or try to find another job with a higher 10-12 load.

Strangely I feel like if I had less of a break I would have been mentally prepared to continue the routine of being at work. But I feel like all these holidays break the routine of consistently working and because there is no long term routine I struggle mentally to be motivated to work… Could I put the extended time off (the extended time doing things I REALLY want to be doing) as the reason why I feel burned out? I’m sitting here considering chucking a few sickies… not because I’m stressed, I love my job and the kids… but I just downright do not want to go in because I just want to be in holiday mode. How do I stay motivated to work?\n\nAnd then I reflect on my partner who gets your standard 4 weeks off a year… and is trying to bank them. So apart from Christmas they’ll pretty much work 51/52 weeks a year. They seem fine? Is the consistency of going to work week in and week out with no allure of extended holidays working in their favour? How much does the routine of going into work every week actually subconsciously assist your mindset to do so? \n\nI guess this is just my little theory and I’m wondering if there’s any substance to it. While holidays are amazing… I think there are drawbacks. If anyone has any tips for me to stay motivated I’d really appreciate it!",

I have had some encouragement to push through and do my absolute best regardless of my situation and know that my uni is supporting me and I hope will tick me off this risk report. Anyone else feeling the burn? Also any tips with stressing less and not feeling so down about other staff members? Thanks :)\n\n*Update*: I ended up passing the RISK with flying colours and only have 2 more weeks of prac :)))) Feeling happy that the end is near!",

I’ve seen a few past posts about Teach For Australia on here, but just wanted to bump the conversation again and see if there’s any more recent opinions out there.\n\nMy situation:\n - undergrad degree with honours in physics and maths\n - halfway through a PhD in physics, had second thoughts and am on “indefinite leave” - i.e. I’ve quit but they’ll take me back if I want to finish it later\n - several years of teaching-adjacent experience: undergrad uni labs and tutorials, visiting high school classes, developing science extension programs for year 12s\n - seriously considering a career change from academia to education\n - 30ish, no kids, partner on decent wage, willing to move interstate or regional\n - classic “type A” student that TFA is looking for, was always good at uni assessments etc.\n\nIf I do decide to go the secondary teaching route (I’m still tossing up a few options) I’m considering Teach For Australia as it would allow me to get a qualification & supervised experience, without losing 2 years of wages. \n\nI’m aware of the greater issues surrounding TFA as a Band-Aid solution to the teacher shortage, and that a much more holistic solution (including more $$$ for teachers) is required, but for my particular situation, it sounds promising.\n\nQuestions for anyone who has experience\n1. I hear TFA can be a gruelling experience. Is the higher workload of TFA worth the ability to get paid while getting a degree reasonably quickly?\n2. How do TFA grads compare to traditional teaching grads when it comes to skills, experience, etc.?\n3. I’m happy to teach at a low-SES school of course, but I hear new teachers tend to  struggle in that environment. Is throwing myself in the deep end like this a bad idea?\n4.

Specifically aiming to go into Occupational Hygiene (https://www.aioh.org.au/)\n\n\nI’ve got an idea, once I’ve got some experience in WHS, of going into guest speaking. \n\n\nStuff like:\n\n\n-Basics of employer and employee responsibilities for worker health and safety. (Good for when kids start getting prepared for work experience)\n\n\n-Subject specific stuff: short presentations about the kinds of risks and hazards in different industries. \n(Could be made very specific or super general)\n\n\n-how to identify psychosocial hazards (that one’ll be good for teachers too) and evaluate their associated risks. \n\n\nFor the more ‘science’ kids a talk about how their science skills can be used to protect worker health. This would be mostly letting kids know the jobs in WHS if they’re going into relevant fields. \n\n\nFor the vocational kids more advanced workplace health and safety concepts. (How cool would it be if a school actively taught the kids who were going into a trade about how to identify hazards and conduct a risk assessment?). \n\n\n\nSo I have two questions:\n\n\n1.

I don’t want to burn out before I really get into it, I really love it so far but I will 100% not make it if I keep this up.

I was driving to school the other morning and heard that in QLD they are bringing out a new framework for AI and I am keen to see what it entails. But I thought I could learn more from seasoned teachers how I can use AI to be more productive with lesson plans and research, and save myself from burnout. Please feel free to share anything but I thought I’d use some prompts as conversation starters too as these are the things I’m focused on lately. \n\nDoes it allow you to support diverse learners? (Any diverse learners, special needs, langauge barriers)\n\nAlignment with the curriculum? (Achievement standards, learning objectives, educational frameworks)\n\nEnhance your research process or productivity? (Think data analysis, literature reviews, or even content generation)\n\nIntegration with lesson planning to enhance your teaching outcomes?

Maybe we can all learn from each other & identify new ways to explore ChatGPT in our classrooms that we hadn’t considered before.

I'll be honest, I don't like teaching and have zero desire to go back. I sometimes regret doing the degree but it's done now. At the time, I thought it was the most realistic for me to do. Reason I don't like it is I don't want to deal with kids and teens as I feel intimidated, like I will make a fool of myself, be disrespected, don't find enjoyment in teaching overall (might be due to having bad experiences tbh and also reading the crap so many teachers put up with). It's just not for me, but put me in front of a class and I will act like I am super confident. I can turn on that side of me but it's not really me. Partner says we all have to do things we don't like. He isn't passionate about his job but he needs to support the family.\n\nFinancially we are quite well off. It's not that we need the money necessarily (although my partner tells me it would be great to have extra), but he thinks it will help us to figure out a school we can send our kids to eventually. And that I have an advantage of being able to go into schools to sus out what's going on from kids to teachers etc. Another argument he uses is to maintain my approval and accreditation (approval is due to expire this year). So not wasting my degree away. And to have a backup in case things change in the future one day (worst case)\n\nI am currently trying to pursue a different career but because it is creative it's seen as the not so smart option, which I get. It's a slow burn and inconsistent (design/illustration) - partner says it's best to do it on the side while teaching.\n\nSome days I bite my tongue and just try to keep moving forward and just go back to teaching. I mean casual pay is great and it's ready for me and schools are desperate so I will definitely have work. Other times I find it so difficult to even think about doing it (I have moderate anxiety as well). I can see the benefit of trialling schools out for sake of the kids. But I don't necessarily think I need to work in a school to do that? Am I wrong??He also wants another child eventually and I don't necessarily want another.

I just wanted to say I enjoy teaching and I understand that people come to Reddit to rant but I just wanted to thank all the great teachers out there. \nI come from a background of auditing/ big 4, and started off in primary. Loved my first school, although my supervisor was terrible, the culture and passion of my colleagues made going to work a dream. \nI left that school after a year and became permanent the following. The culture was dead at the school and teachers seemed to want to show off more than help each other. I had some great times building the culture but there were still too many negative nellys. \nThis year I made the switch to high school after 4 years, and the culture is even worse. People don’t even acknowledge each other walking past. I have an awesome faculty to work with so it all makes it worthwhile. \nI’m not really sure what my point is but I’ll add my feeling now: \nIt’s good being able to leave at 3:30 each day after working hard. The people who stay back are often the ones gossiping and wasting time. \nThe processes of everything is a night mare. Coming out of auditing I just wish more teachers would embrace technology and lay off the emails. \nI really appreciate all the colleagues who share resources. My old mentor was a cranky woman who never shared anything unless she received credit. Please just be happy to improve student growth and share everything. \nCurrently building up resources for a second year in a row, due to their being no planning or documents, I like this as I get to do things my own way. \nTo sum up.

In my experience talking to teachers in person about my career choice the vibes are very much \"you have amazing days and terrible days, you have amazing kids and terrible kids, it has goods and bads just like any job\". But this sub makes it sound like \"being a teacher is selling your sole to the devil, say goodbye to your santiy and will to live, escape now before it's too late\". \n\nI don't want to live in denial, I know there's a behavioural crisis, salary issues, understaffing and manipulation from higher ups. But despite all that, are there teachers out there who still love their job? Who are having a good experience? Or are you even atleast satisfied? Would you still choose it over other career paths? \n\nI've worked in corporate/industry and it was soulsucking, I couldn't stand sitting in pointless meetings talking about profits for products I didn't care about. Even though I'm great at what I do and had tried working in marketing, real estate, media, research, I've done it all and all of it left me feeling unforfilled and slogging away for no real reason, I had a mini-crisis that led to me quitting my job and feeling like I'd never find a career that I felt passionate about. It wasn't until a mentor said I'd make a great teacher with my niche in communications that I pursued it. I'm working in schools now as an SSO and doing my master of teaching and for the most part I'm really enjoying it. \n\nI felt like teaching was my ikigai, something I'm good at, something I can get paid for and something the world needs. I'm a realist/optimistic person who came from a very successfully run low SES school so I always felt I could handle what teaching threw at me. I also had planned to go back into research for a education company once I had teaching well under my belt because I want to do something that matters. I feel so passionate but I know it's not going to be a walk in the park. \n\nBut still this sub has alarm bells going off in my head, so much so I'm like, do I even want to risk it. I feel myself filling with doubt everytime I see a \"teaching is a scam job and is ruining my life\" post which is much more frequent than any uplifting post. Does everyone seriously really feel this way? \n\nSo please, if you have anything mildly positive to say to a student teacher about teaching as career choice, say it. Extra points if you can give me some detail rather than just \"I love teaching trust me\" I need to know why and if I'd be able to see that for myself aswell. \n\nYa girl, and I imagine alot of other student teachers, need to hear it. Before i have a second mini-life crisis. Lol.\n\nEdit: Thankyou everyone for your honest responses, these comments bring me so much hope and inspiration, I feel alot better, I guess its a matter of finding the right school once I am teaching and staying off this page till I can jump in on the vent train haha!",

It was long time ago but I still remember my confusion. Example:\n\nWe are discussing avoidance behaviours such as preferring to shoot hoops over sitting in a classroom. It is obvious a student prefers something fun, avoids any perceived adversity. So, how do we change it? \n\nWe take the student out and shoot hoops with them or do an activity within the school that feels safe for the student. That is literally what she told us in the most simple terms. In other words, we accommodate a student to first anchor them in a school environment hoping learning will come in its own time.\n\nSo how reinforcing an avoidant behaviour is meant to help dealing with classroom adversity? Here a behaviourists eye brow should go up.\n\nIs it by becoming students friend in a shared fun activity? Is it the unconditional positive regard hoping a student will gradually see the inherent value in learning? I honestly don't know.\nI did not dare to ask but it seemed quite odd to put out a fire by pouring more fuel it.

Similarly, it’s not an expectation in NSW schools (where it’s understood the opposite will occur), nor can I find it in the The Victorian Teaching Profession’s Code of Conduct. I can’t speak for other states and territories (someone may be able to clarify - if so, please do!). It’s also not referred to in the AITSL Teaching Standards.\n\nEdit: as noted, I’m aware personal views can cross into other areas of policy, hence my comment on protecting student wellbeing, and that may constitute a breach(e.g. in WA we’re rightly expected to create cultural safety, embrace equity, diversity and inclusion, and maintain safety and wellbeing). I was referring to specific mentions of personal views are disallowed.",

Basically, do 4 years in an approved Remote Area school and have your teacher studies HELP debt paid off.  Here's the [site](https://www.education.gov.au/higher-education-loan-program/reduction-help-debts-teachers-very-remote-areas) with all the info including lists of eligible schools across Australia.There are two parts to it, a waiver of indexation for right now while you are working there (so your debt doesn't increase) and then payback at the end of the 1400 days.  You do still need to make the compulsory payments but at the end you pay off whatever HELP debt is owing and get the rest as a fat tax return.  One teacher my wife knows of has already done 3 years (it's backdated to 2019) and so will get a 15k or so repayment in next year's return. This incentive helped keep that teacher here for another year, so it has already worked for both the teacher and the school.\n\nIn addition to this incentive, we've found there are a number of allowances depending on the school system (state, catholic, private) and whether the state you are in provides additional allowances.  These can be electricity, aircon (yes, separate from power), cheap flights (WA government has capped pricing for return flights from certain country towns) and cheap rent.\n\nWith regards to rent, it is already cheaper than Perth where you could pay 30-50% of your income on rent whereas here you will pay 10% salary sacrificed which in real terms means about 6%.  That extra money in your pocket can start going towards the massive deposit you need for that city house.\n\nI won't suggest the housing the school provides is gorgeous or new or even recently renovated.  You may even end up sharing with other teachers.  It \"depends\" where you are but with the cheap rent, things like a cleaner and lawnmowing included, and no real cost on housing in total, it's a bargain that can set you up for life.\n\nThere are probably other incentives I'm not aware of and as stated, different states and systems will have different incentives, definitely get yourself a good accountant, they are worth every penny. But wherever you are in Aus, have a think about getting out to the country and becoming part of a real community.\n\nps. Can't give too many details as I have a potty mouth and other posts might reflect badly on her (yeah right, things are a little more unrestrained out here).",

All we are looking for are your opinions, thoughts, and ideas. Kind of like a think tank. \n\n**What's in It for You**: I'll be upfront – we can't promise a lot. What we can offer is the chance to get your hands on free prototypes and the opportunity to help improve STEM education in our schools.\n\n**Why Join**: If you're someone who's all in for STEM education, or knows nothing about programming (even better). Together, we can make a robotics kit that is simple to set up, low-cost, and rewarding for the students. \n\n**How to Get Involved**: If this sounds exciting or you want more details, shoot me a message.

  "title": "Maths teachers I have a question",
  "selftext": "I’m a new teacher and maths isn’t my KLA.\n\nMy question is about my own experiences of maths in high school (in Vic, late 90s/early 00s).\n\nThis is how I remember it:\n\nI was pretty good at maths until middle of year 7.\n\nI was put in the high ability class at the beginning of the year based on a pre-test before start of year.\n\nThen I started to struggle. I would follow the formulas in the text book but my answers would be wrong. I asked for help, the teacher would say “just follow the formula”. I thought I did. I tried again and it wouldn’t work. I asked for help again, the teacher said I wasn’t following the formula. To the best of my memory, she didn’t explain how I wasn’t, or maybe I didn’t understand the explanation.\n\nI was then moved into not the middle ability maths class but the low ability maths class. I continued to struggle. I would ask genuine questions about how this relates to anything and ask for help doing the work. I couldn’t understand why we were doing what we were doing most of the time, unless something had an obvious real world application.\n\nI did poorly in maths for the rest of high school EXCEPT percentages, which I got 99% in the test for while the rest of the class basically failed. We had to re-do the test (with different questions) and the second time I got 100%.\n\nI remember occasionally getting the right answers for some things but my “working out” was wrong; I was getting the right answer but not using the prescribed formula.\n\nBut apart from that I just couldn’t get it. In year 11 I basically stopped opening my books and often wagged maths class (and I never did this with any other subject). Obviously the fact I was bad at maths affected my motivation but I also continued to be unconvinced about the value of what they were teaching us in terms of life in general. (Even though I did know then on some level, and I definitely know now, that learning maths at school has huge value beyond “how will this help me directly in life”. Talking about problem solving and analytical thinking etc etc.)\n\nAnyway I dropped maths entirely for year 12 with full support from all teachers (in fact it was a maths teacher who strongly encouraged me to not do any maths in year 12). This was highly unusual at my school - everyone was generally encouraged to at least do general maths in year 12.\n\nSince then I’ve lived believing there’s something wrong with my brain in some way. I still remember basic times tables from morning drills in primary school, and I can do more complicated multiplications if I have the time. If they’re really complicated I need to do it on paper or REALLY REALLY concentrate, but would probably need to write down the mini multiplications so I don’t forget them so I can then add them together at the end.\n\nBut when I see anything with lots of numbers, or anything resembling algebra, or even any kind of data representation (graphs and charts) that in my opinion seems to require an above-average level of mathematic proficiency to understand I experience one or more of the following:\n\n* eyes glaze over\n* vision blurs\n* instant nausea\n* indigence\n* sense of failure\n\nI was never great at calculating the right change with 100% accuracy when I worked hospitality jobs, which always confused me because I really felt like I was calculating it correctly but I’d then come up with the wrong change. And I could never balance the till at the end of the night.\n\nBUT I scored far above average in the numeracy part of LANTITE.\n\nAnd I can get by day to day. I don’t THINK I have ~~dysgraphia~~ dyscalculia but I’m not an expert and need to do more reading about it.\n\nI do have ADHD (recent adult diagnoses and I believe, and the doctor agrees, that I’ve definitely had it from very young age). I think ADHD probably explains my struggles to do head maths under pressure. When I have plenty of time I get the right answers.\n\nBut what explains me being apparently good at maths until I suddenly wasn’t? What happened?\n\nA more general question is: is there any single factor that makes a person inherently more likely to understand and succeed in maths at school?\n\nOne teacher in year 9 or 10 said at parent teacher interviews told me and my mum that I “missed something crucial in maths at some point and it was affecting my ability to keep up now”.\n\nThis is mostly curiosity. (On some level it’s also insecurity. I dream of one day being able to do maths but it’s absolutely a pointless thing to spend any time on at this late stage.)\n\nSo if any maths teachers read this and have any ideas I’d love to know what you think. Why was I bad at maths at school? Is there anything you see in the students you’ve taught who just don’t “get” maths?\n\nAs a new (non-maths) teacher I’d also love to understand maths more so I can understand maths teaching more so I can understand teaching more.",

  "selftext": "Writing from the perspective of a new English teacher in NSW (secondary).\n\nHere’s how I think it should be for beginning teachers (based on full-time employment):\n\n**BEFORE TEACHING:**\n\n* *Either* you complete a standard teaching degree (2 year Masters/4 year Bach) that includes ample, quality professional experience (pracs),\n* *or* you complete a shorter teaching degree (1 year Masters, 3 years Bach) where you learn about pedagogy and educational psychology etc, and it include a more modest amount of prac time (not none, but not \"ample\" as it should be in a 2 year Masters/4 year Bach) with the understanding that proper practical learning/training happens when you first begin working.\n\n**YEAR ONE:**\n\n* You start working on a graduate salary. In full-time employment you have two of your own classes. No more face-to-face teaching time than those two classes is allowed. Rest of time is spend doing observation of other teachers, planning, marking and meeting with/shadowing a mentor, who is assigned and given relief time accordingly.\n* Then after two terms you take on casual covers equal to one class load, retaining your two original classes. Observation and mentoring etc continues.\n\n**YEAR TWO:**\n\n* In your second year you take on a third class of your own, plus casual covers equal to one class load, meaning your timetable comprises face-to-face teaching time equal to four classes. Mentoring continues and observation whenever it fits.\n* Then in the second half of your second year you go up to a full timetable of face-to-face teaching time, either with four classes of your own and casual covers or (if there is a class available that needs a teacher) or with casual covers to make up the difference.\n\n**YEAR THREE:**\n\n* In your third year you take on a fifth class of your own, meaning your entire timetable of face-to-face teaching time comprises your own classes.\n* At the end of your third year you submit for proficient teacher accreditation to get the pay bump at the start of your fourth year, where you obviously continue with your own full class load plus no more than six additional cover periods (\"extras\") per term.\n\n*Note: Obviously the lack of necessary funding and resources (as in, the number of teachers needed) means it would never happen this way, but it’s really the only way I can imagine that new teachers could be fully supported and the main goal of teaching (improving student outcomes) could actually be achieved.*\n\nAm curious to hear what people think. Experienced teachers might think it all sounds unfair, and that you managed so it’s clearly doable, but I just ask you to imagine what this would’ve done for you in your early days. I sometimes think that experienced teachers don’t remember how hard starting out is. Then there’s also the fact that the world today is very, very different to the world 10, 20 years ago. Students are different, schools are different, technology is hugely different just for starters.\n\nRegardless, know that I admire all of you out there teaching, and that new teachers really look to those with experience as beacons of knowledge - much of which we saw none of at university!\n\n**15-5 8:57pm: Small edit made to clarify that the mentor would get relief time. I've also italicised  my disclaimer and moved it below the dot points.**\n\n**17-5 2:30pm: Edits made throughout dot points to remove my use of \"0.4\" etc and clarify the breakdown between own classes and covers in the first two years; also added missing dot point to clarify what happens in third year; added subheadings.**",

Most of my uni mates with a Masters are pulling 100-120k, while I’m stuck on 90k because I’m in the education state where teachers are paradoxically underpaid. \n\nIt seems to me that teaching is an impossible career choice if you are financially starting from scratch or have no wish to pull 50 hour weeks as a leading teacher or AP. It would irreparably damage your life prospects because you would only be able to afford the cheapest of the cheap houses on the outer fringe, which in many cases are some distance away from where you actually teach, and benefit least from capital growth. It’s a heavy price to pay for those sweet 10+ week breaks. \n\nI want to say that I’m leaving sooner or later to fully apply myself elsewhere, and the only way I’ve been managing to live a cushy lifestyle so far is because I was gifted a modest property (don’t be jelly - it probably goes backwards in real value) that I have all to myself.

I am worried that I might be missing out on important tailored subject-specific information at RMIT. \n\nSo my questions are: \n\n1.  To all the people who have done their degrees is were those learning method subjects quite useful and indispensable for you as you begun your initial teaching career. \n2. To all the teachers here, does going to Unimelb help me get into teacher positions at schools easier? Like would I be able to get into private and catholic schools easier as compared to RMIT?

  "selftext": "I'm not \"From the NSWTF\". I've been a member since I graduated and I've been a fed rep in 4 different workplaces across the state. I'm distressed and disappointed by some of the attitudes towards unionism that I see in this forum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's deal with this first - I'm also distressed and disappointed by the anemic actions of the NSWTF over the last 2 years. They got basically nowhere on the top level award negotiations, and I understand that people are upset by the outcome and cynical at the expectation that a handful of rallies spread out over a year would actually do anything. But if you blame the union for this, you've fallen for the government's play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPublic sector unionism has been deliberately hobbled in NSW for over a decade. For better or worse, the union has to follow the law - a huge part of their purpose is to represent members in navigating the complex environment presented by industrial relations legislation - and that legislation has been carefully designed to break union power. This should be obvious - the legislation was designed by the Liberal party, who see unions as one of their biggest enemies. If you want stronger industrial action, you can expect stronger retaliation from the government up to and including fining the union out of existence and deregistering the organisation for engaging in illegal industrial action. I don't think rolling strikes or work to rule will actually be effective anyway, because people will get sick of giving up their pay pretty quickly, and I don't really trust any teacher to stick to a work to rule campaign.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway. What I want to explore here are more productive strategies that jumping onto reddit to explore your gripes about the union executive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe union is not a cop that you can call to arrest your boss. The union is not there to arbitrate personal disputes in the workplace. The union does not offer guaranteed service for fees.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe union is a member organisation. It requires participation by members at all levels to be effective. There are really 3 levels to this - the workplace, the association, and 'the union's (state conference/executive) and your zone of control diminishes the further into that hierarchy you go, as would be expected in any democratic organisation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt the workplace level this means actually electing a committee, and having that committee actually act in the interests of members in that workplace. This is really vital. As soon as school exec start to put local policies and procedures in place that are inconsistent with our award conditions, the staffing agreement (etc), it's the role of that committee to push back to ensure that the school are actually following the rules. This might look like making sure the policy on extra periods and meadowbanks is actually followed. It might look like making sure the determination on arrival times is actually followed (these were always the 2 most common questions for me as a fed rep). It might look like challenging a timetable that doesn't allow for an uninterrupted 30 minute unpaid meal break. In some cases, it might look like challenging a decision that jeopardises the safety of staff, like an instance of student violence not being adequately addressed. It might be something extremely obvious and easy to address like a pregnant employee having their contract changed for operational convenience in a way that deals them out of maternity leave. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll of this requires a fed rep and workplace committee that actually represents the interests of members in the workplace. If your fed rep is ineffective or too buddied up with the principal - vote them out. Workplace committee elections have to happen annually, for this exact reason.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt higher levels, we have less influence. Our method of raising issues to the agenda of the whole union is via association meetings. If you've never been to one - well I empathise with you, we're all busy - but you're dealing yourself out of representation at this level and shouldn't complain when 'nothing is done'. The agenda is set by those who turn up. All members are free and welcome to raise motions at these meetings to go to state council to be debated and voted on by that body. We elect our state councillors. If you're not happy with yours, stand for election or vote for someone else. Again, at this level, everyone is a fellow teacher, not someone working for the union full time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's vitally important that union participation in our workforce continue (and really, that participation improve!). If you think we have it bad now, look at what's going on in the USA where teacher unions in heaps of states are so suppressed that they aren't even allowed to represent members in their version of award negotiations. The result is teachers leaving en masse to get paid better in fast food and retail, and being replaced by people without qualifications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL,dr: you are the union. All that energy spent griping can easily be redirected towards organising.",

I was wondering why other people's experiences of teaching with ADHD is? When I google it I find about teaching students who have ADHD.\n\nI have the deficit type, I zone out a lot, try hard, find it hard to focus, sometimes hyper focus, and seem very agitated and moody without meaning too. Especially if noises become to much. I'm happy I have a lovely team, but won't be disclosing my condition due to judgement. Besides, I have spent 40 years not knowing I had it myself 😂. \n\nStrategies I am using is exercise, art and working on my time management and organisation skills.\n\nWith less women being diagnosed with ADHD who have it, and the deficit type being hard to pick up, and can be beneath the surface of depression/anxiety, I wonder how much burnout can be attributed to untreated ADHD. \n\nCan anyone share their experiences?? Or if your school discusses the neurodivergence of teachers??",

  "selftext": "Is it important? Absolutely? \nDo I think it’s valuable? Sure. \n\nHowever…\nIt’s an hour of my life on a bus (combined both ways) with like 50 kids. \n+ plus like an hour and a half in a hot pool that is extreme sensory overload that I can’t combat because I have to be on high alert for behaviours while also looking “interested” and “engaged”. \n\nIt mucks up my schedule teaching and makes me anxious, I don’t like change, I’ve never been good at it. It makes the kids tired and you simply can’t get anything done with them that’s valuable and will actually stick. It’s a frustrating, endless, overwhelming repetitive strain on my teaching for two full weeks.\n\nIt’s the residual chlorine smell that builds up in the classroom, and it’s the fact it’s the beginning of winter and flu season that really ices my cake. I can’t afford to get sick, yet I know by the end of the second week I will be. \n\nThere’s got to be a better way of doing it. I don’t know what or how, but being down to about an hour and a half of uninterrupted teaching each day is pushing my stress levels through the roof. Reports are soon, as is parent teacher night. I go from two weeks of swimming into a nightmare week of trying to make sure everyone gets into see me who wants to see me. \n\nI hate it. There’s no “good time” to plan to have it either. It’s first in best booking and most schools have standard times they’ve had for years because there’s only so many pools that can cater for swim classes. \n\n1st term and you don’t know your kids well enough and can’t establish order and routine well enough before it gets thrown out of whack to possibly never return. You also now have naplan since that moved. \n\n2nd term and you have mid year reports, IEP updates and moderation, and parent teacher nights. You also have things like discos and other “darkness required” events. \n\n3rd term is the best term so you don’t really want to interrupt it, but lots of kids end up sick because it’s flu season. Best time for indoor excursions though if you can manage it. Weather starts to look good again and most places are slightly cheaper too. \n\n4th term and everything starts going down hill into the frenzy at week 5, reports, new classes, end of year IEP meetings and in some cases a second round of parent teacher nights. Pat testing I think also falls in this term though it’s dates may be different like naplan. Overall the kids start feeling the end of year and it’s hard enough to keep them stable. Then you have to wrap it all up and start planning for the next year. \n\nLearn to swim week is honestly my least favourite thing about teaching that’s at a “beyond my control”/not a parent or kid specific issue. \n\nSure there are worst things but when you’re in the thick of swim fortnight, not much feels worse. \n\nI’m so tired.",

I was already out of my element and stressed.\n\nSecondly, my supervising teacher was on part time, so the majority of the time, I was set up with other teachers, so I never really had that opportunity to establish solid connections with my supervising teacher as did other preservice teacher to their supervisors.\n\nFinally, the criteria that I was required to complete was a minimum of 3 observation tasks (out of a total of 7) over 10 days of placements, along with 2 whole lessons of teaching.\n\nI completed my criteria early (1-2 days until the final day), with 7 completed observations and 3 whole lessons of teaching. I had feedback that said my teaching was surprisingly unexpected, since my character was more quiet, whereas my teaching was strong, loud and confident. Moreover, since I completed my 7 observations early, I started working on lesson planning during class time, making use of my time. Even though my lesson plans were sent to my supervisor a little later then preferred, I still had a majority of positive feedback.\n\nInstead of passing, I proceeded to fail my placements. Yeah, I flunked somehow. In  addition to working on lesson plans in class times, I was reprimanded, by not even my own supervising teacher, but a random fill in teacher, since my own teacher was off for the day. I should have been “observing” yet I had already completed these observations quite a while ago. I was required to complete a MINIMUM of 3 observations and 2 whole lessons of teaching, yet I exceeded expectations by completing all 7 observations and 3 whole lessons.\n\nMake it make sense!!!\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone in the comments who pointed out what I could have done better and what I should do in the future, you cannot believe how much those tips mean to me. Just wanted to put it out there, I do not believe that my supervisor was bad or anything. They were very kind and helped me out wherever they could, so god bless their soul. I’ll try my best for my next practical, taking into consideration the many different aspects that it requires to be a teacher!\n\nI’ll also remember that one comment about sucking eggs and that other guy beefing with me over internet grammar and spelling. 😂 Thanks, that made my day more than anything!\n\nAgain, thanks to everyone who responded with tips and hindsight (especially those who gave their own experiences). I’m very grateful for such awesome… We’re all in the same field of study? Seniors? Upperclassmen?",

Got a very high ATAR and took a couple of years off after finishing school basically out of paralysis because I felt I shouldn’t “waste” my grades on a low entry course, but couldn’t bring myself to do something like law or medicine either. Eventually started uni at 20, did a BA in English and History. I’ve just graduated that with a WAM of 85. Applied for the MTeach planning to teach in my major fields as well as languages once I get some official certification for these (I speak Italian and French). Since graduating uni I have found my family and husband have really cooled on the idea of me teaching, mostly citing concerns about the pay, the way the education sector is run and perceived in Australia, the lack of progression opportunities, and the low entry requirements for the MTeach. I find myself getting defensive of teaching every time I have a conversation about the career with them. I’ve been working as an educator in early childhood for the last 3 years and mostly enjoyed it. Some kids and parents have been difficult but I’ve found the work community at my school (pre-K to Yr 12) was pretty good, building relationships with both children and colleagues was rewarding and the aspects of teaching, planning and documenting were fulfilling and mostly worthwhile. It’s great to see a concept you’ve been working on bringing across just click with the kids in front of your eyes. I’ve always thought I would eventually teach high school, mostly as the students are more independent, you can have a bit more class conversation and banter, and you get to work within specific subject areas. People I’ve worked with in early childhood have said high school suits my personality and communication style and they could see me doing it.\n\nI understand my family’s legitimate concerns about teaching as a career in Australia right now. I just wanted to put the question to you guys as teachers, do I go for it and enrol in my MTeach classes or seriously forget the whole thing and invest myself in something else?

I do not have an official 45 days of supervised teaching in the classroom from my university as it was not a requirement.

Are leading teachers / learning specialist roles competitive? Even in rural areas? As a regular classroom teacher (science and maths) I get an interview for every job I apply to in high SES areas. Now I'm not expecting it to be that easy, but is there a similar teacher shortage at the leadership level?\n2. Is the workload of leading teachers / learning specialists much higher than a regular classroom teacher?\n3. Are there particular learning specialist / leading teacher roles that have a lower workload? (ie numeracy coaches? year level leaders? numeracy growth leaders, student engagement, etc).\n4. Are there any learning specialist / leading teacher roles that are more in the shadows rather than public figures of the school?\n5. Any advice on getting a leadership role?

  "selftext": "Hi everyone - as the title says, I really feel like I need some advice.\n\nI'm nearly finished my teaching degree (Bachelor of Secondary Education), and I've just finished my third in-school placement. I've only got my final 10 week placement, and two units to go before I finish my degree. I'm studying in NSW, but I'm an OUA student, so I'm doing my pracs via the WA system, if that context is useful to my question. I'm also studying to be an English teacher. \n\nI feel my placement has gone fairly well. For the most part I've gotten very positive feedback from my mentor teacher, and I certainly feel like I've gotten a lot of useful feedback. It's become pretty clear to me that my strength is my knowledge of the content (I've been tutoring the HSC for the past ten years, so this is something I'm very confident with) and my weakness, or at least, the area where I need further development in, is my classroom management. Overall, my mentor teacher said the way I handled my classes was good, and the way I managed and redirected student misbehaviour was good, but there were a few times when the class got quite rowdy that I really struggled with.\n\nOne thing my mentor teacher consistently pointed out was my reluctance to raise my voice. To be clear, I have no issue raising my voice, and projecting quite a stern voice. I have experience public speaking as well, and my mentor noted that I project my voice quite well, but the point my mentor kept bringing up was yelling. They thought I needed to yell at the class a bit more. They did say that it was something that should be used very sparingly, and that it should never be relied on consistently, but also that when a class (Year 7 for context here) was really rowdy, and getting out of hand - sometimes yelling is the only thing to do to bring them under control. At their direction I tried it out a bit, and it did work (somewhat) but it has left me feeling deeply uncomfortable.   \n\n\nThis is where I feel I need advice - I'm not sure how much my own personal beliefs are interfering with my ability to teach effectively. I don't want to yell at children. I question whether I have the right to yell at children (ethically speaking). In almost every other aspect of interpersonal relationships outside of school, yelling is considered inappropriate and abusive. I also grew up in a very verbally abusive household, with parents constantly yelling at me as their default form of communication, and I remember from when I was in high school that it could be quite upsetting, and occasionally triggering when I would be yelled at by teachers. I don't want to put a child through that, no matter how rowdy they are. I've always believed, and have been told by other teaching friends, that a good teacher should never get to the point where they need to yell, but obviously that doesn't really hold up in the practical context of the classroom.  \n\n\nWhere do you sit on this issue? Is it appropriate to yell at a class, or a student? Am I letting my personal feelings get in the way?",

Was wondering which one would be better/easier to choose for anyone that has been to either particular for maths and what the structure of each subject is like i.e assignments, weekly quiz, 50% finals? And if the exams are proctored or not. Also would all of my completed subjects at UNSW transfer over? Cuz my unsw degree was meant to be 4 yrs. Thanks!",

  "selftext": "I’m thinking of becoming a teacher. But I’m not sure if I will like it or not. I was hoping to get some insight from people who work in the industry before I take the plunge into doing an MTeach. A bit of background on me. I already have two degrees; sports management and psychology. And have found finding an appropriate career incredibly difficult. I have ADHD (or at least some kind’ve misdiagnosed CPTSD) and choose to be unmedicated. I think this plays a big part in my career choices as I have a tendency to get bored quite easily and then want to change as soon as the job becomes monotonous.  \nThe thing is I’m worried about doing an M/Teach which will inflate my Hecs balance even more. Additionally, not working full time for a year and then get in the door and find out it’s another thing I’m just not that into. \n\nCurrently i work in residential youth care. Now I don’t hate the work but it can be brutal. I enjoy engaging with the kids however, the problem is that’s few and far between. I have found myself more often than being a punching bag either verbally/physically, a glorified cleaner, slave to their requests and worse. The industry is pretty broken and I feel downtrodden with the kids that I interact with on the daily. Not to mention I’m having some poor emotional reactions to the plight of some of these kids. But like I said, I do enjoy engaging with the kids when it can be done.  \n\nWhen I think about a career I enjoy being on my feet, I like doing a bunch of different tasks throughout the day. I am motivated somewhat by money and would like some sort’ve career progression. If I do the same thing all the time I become negative and unfulfilled. Emails and paperwork are a drag in youth work. But I don’t mind if it’s not all day. I’m not the best with micromanaging and do get frustrated if I’m constantly being told what to do/say. I work pretty hard and would say I’m a real doer. Suppose I just get bored easily. \n\nObviously, this sub has some pretty strong opinions on being a teacher and I totally get that reddit isn’t always the best place for objective advice. I’m just very unsure of myself around this subject and looking to get as much info as possible. \nAny advice would be amazing.",

  "selftext": "Hi everyone. I'm currently a primary school teacher in the Singapore public education service. Been teaching here since 2008.\n\nI am seriously considering moving to Melbourne to teach in some of the private schools in the suburbs. Some of those schools' board members/principals apparently have been coming to Singapore to interview and recruit potential teachers while others have done their interviews online over Zoom etc. \n\nI personally know of one acquaintance who has made the jump and is already teaching in a private school in Melbourne. He was offered an annual salary of 100k and has about 6 years of teaching experience in Singapore.\n\nAnother closer acquaintance of mine will be moving there too after securing an annual salary of 108k with a private school in Melbourne with less than 10 years of teaching experience here. His teaching designation in Singapore is more to what Australia would term a 'teacher's aide'. It seems that the recruiting private school there doesn't bother to make a distinction between different teacher 'types'.\n\nIn both cases, it seems that the private schools as their employers have sponsored and paid for their works visas. Both acquaintances of mine are also aiming for permanent residency status there.\n\nMy raison d'etre in moving to teach in Australia is ultimately to have a better work/life balance for myself, family and child. I do note the huge amount of grievances by the educators here in Reddit regarding how the work/life balance there has gone to the dregs and I am wondering whether I will be 'jumping from the wok and into the fire' lol. Then again, I can only make a fair comparison on which country is worse in terms of work/life balance after undergoing at least a year's worth of teaching in Australia.\n\nWith that being said, I do have a few concerns that I hope will be addressed by the esteemed members here.\n\n1. What should I look out for in my terms of contract to prevent myself from being exploited/be underpaid? From what I've read here, it seems that potential teacher recruits can negotiate the terms of contracts with the school principal or administration?\n\n\n2.  Apparently, the Super contribution by the employer is on top of the annual salary offered. Is the Super contribution by the employer the same for everyone in terms of percentage of annual pay? How much do employees need to contribute to their Super from their annual pay?\n\n\n3. How does salary sacrificing work and how will it benefit oneself?\n\n\n4. How does one maximise tax rebates to lower down the annual income tax?\n\n\n5. If one is not a permanent resident there, what's the normal range for an annual private insurance per person?\n\n\n6. Is it more advantageous and secure to be registered with the local teaching union, teachers' accreditation bodies, professional licensing organisations etc? It seems the private schools that are hiring doesn't even need us to go through all this. They are hiring based on our teaching experience and certifications from Singapore.\n\n\nI do have many more questions but those above are the most pressing ones currently.\n\n\nHave a good weekend everyone!",

  "selftext": "I speak as a 10+ years experienced languages teacher so please hear me out! And with full disclosure that many things don't work about our education system and a shoutout to my CAPA brethren who are in a similar boat.\n\nIf your reply is 'well it is what it is' then I got here first to save you the time. I am also talking about the reality of offering languages across the state, in some schools where no kids have a passport and may never have one.\n\n100 hours of languages is TOO LONG. Modern students do not commit to school in the same way as we used to. It should be 50 hours and then not only taking in students who can commit and be motivated, but also giving them a real crack at becoming fluent by offering more course hours from Year 9 onwards. drip feeding 2.5 hours of language instruction a week to kids for 3 years gets them nowhere and they do not develop meaningful communication skills.\n\nThe only current successful students are those who commit 3-5 hours a week outside of class hours (read: equal to or more in-class time) to study.\n\nCurrent reality re: languages in schools:\n\n* Many schools struggle to staff languages\n* Term 3 + 4 of Year 8 are just hell for both the languages teacher and exec with behaviour issues.\n* Languages are linear, build on each other and require regular revision - with 100 hours of mandatory we do one of the following:\n   * We either keep the pace up (possible at very academic schools) and all students (14 year olds!) are required to seriously attempt it for 100 hours\n   * We water the subject down, give them lots of culture and non-linear language phrases and have low expectations to keep the teenagers happy. Many teachers do this and 'gear up' properly in Year 9 onwards - however this also has issues. \n      * The further we stray from real communicative teaching, the more students with motivation and potential do not actually experience the joy of communication (which takes a lot of hard work to be able to answer even basic who/what/when/where/why) \n      * Non-serious students then attempt the elective and get burned and we watch the life slowly fade from their eyes as they can't cope.\n* Language teachers often individually run every course from 7-12 in their school and yet most of their time goes to behaviour issues from Year 8 students who don't want to be there.\n\nThere is no 'oh well let's see how they go in the new topic'. It's like teaching Maths, but there is no streaming and you get everyone. Teaching could feel like this in all subjects but I think there are few things more pointless than teaching languages to students past Term 2 of Year 8. \n\nDon't even start us on how difficult it is to get overseas trips approved and run nowadays, let alone the extra paperwork.\n\nAll comments accepted and welcomed.",

However the school was fully aware this kid was a massive bully. It was common knowledge amongst everyone in our year level that he was very predatory and especially took advantage of girls at parties who were extremely intoxicated in a vulnerable state.\n\nI am thinking of writing a letter to the school. My main concern is that he is now in a position of authority working with vulnerable teenagers, going on school camps etc etc. To my knowledge he never faced any legal or social repercussions for his behaviour and the school may not have any knowledge of his past transgressions. \n\nMy intention isn't to get him fired or ruin his career, but to simply make them aware of his history of inappropriate sexual behaviour with the hope he will undergo further training to support him to remain accountable for his ongoing professional behaviour and conduct throughout his career. \n\nHas anybody been in a similar situation who might be able to assist me in recommendations to put forward for this teacher?

I accepted a full-time, permanent position at a school that's located over two hours away from where I currently am. This was over two months ago. \n\nI was very honest in that I wouldn't be able to accept the position if departmental housing wasn't available, as my finances wouldn't allow me to rent a dog house in this current climate, let alone a property nearby. \n\nThey advised that a local school in another town may have some accommodation for me, for up to six months (which works out – still gives me time to build up some credible ammo to apply for a rental thereafter). They said they'd in contact with the school, and myself to keep me updated. \n\nA while goes by, I'm on dual-PEx so I'm working nine straight weeks at two schools. I still find some time to follow-up with an email. No response. I give them a call. The deputy is on holiday. Okay, cool... \n\nI email one person, they tell me to email somebody else, who says to contact this other person. We're running in circles at this point and nobody seems to care at all. I feel I've just been lied to, essentially, and left stranded with no idea what to do. \n\nForward to now, it's the last week of term, and I decided to call the school that's supposedly offering the housing. Nothing available they tell me. \n\nAt this point, I'm just assuming I'm SOL. I just can't foresee the four hour daily commute to and from work (not to mention the fuel and toll prices), so I will likely need to turn down the position.\n\nSo... How fucked am I? Will I now have to wait until at least term 2 to find another school to take me on? I'm still assuming CRT work will still be fairly easy to obtain (South Gold Coast region)? \n\nThe whole idea of getting this job was to improve my current life situation (life has not been kind to me in the past 2.5 years), and I feel I just can't get a break. I was under the impression I was needed (an IDT teacher left last week, I was taking on all his classes), but yet their actions tell me they don't really seem to care...? \n\nAnyway, apologies for the giant wall of text. I'm just a mixture of frustrated, sad and dejected. \n\nThank you for reading. If anybody could share similar experiences and what you did to combat it, that would be awesome.",

Obviously hard “no” is the safest option, but my high school teachers were huge influences on me/the reason I got into teaching, and having contact with them post-school was a huge support (but this was back when there were way less restrictions around social media contact).

And teachers, of course, need wayyy better treatment too.\n\nAs you would all have first-hand experience of, COVID-19 and the aftermath has hit young people and teachers in Schools quite hard. The pandemic has shown to us all that the current school curriculum needs to adapt and constantly change to fit the requirements of 21st Century. And most importantly, to prepare that the youth adequately for the challenges of life, as well as assist in creating purposeful and meaningful careers.\n\nAs teachers, you all have intimate and comprehensive knowledge of the challenges that young individuals face in and out of school.

  "selftext": "I hope no one minds me posting here still being preservice, but I always find such practical advice on this sub when needed so I thought that posting here might help me with the pickle I seem to be in at the moment. \n\nI am currently on one of my last placements and will be at the school (secondary, NSW) until the end of term. I have only been there a week and have been trying my best not to ruffle any feathers or get in anyone’s way. Ao far it has been a lot of asking questions, listening, reflecting, learning about the kids, participating throughout the school where I can, etc.\n\nHowever, I've been really struggling since starting the placement with a particular teacher in the faculty I’m working in. She isn't my supervising teacher but because the faculty is so small (small school, significant teacher shortage in the area), I have been observing all the teachers this week in rotation. At lunch time the faculty sits around a communal table and chats.\n\nBy no means has this teacher done anything wrong towards me, however she is constantly talking negatively and quite inappropriately about the students. She says things like, \"they're trash,\" “they are all so stupid,” “they shouldn’t even be here,” “they’re incapable,\" \"I don't know why I bother,\" and some other concerning stuff. She seems to be very burnt out, which I understand. Today she even insinuated that new DOE behavioural policies should be to bring back corporal punishment. It's not an exaggeration to say that she is only speaks negatively about the students, both in the staffroom and classroom. \n\nI haven't said anything to anyone, but at this point it's making me really uncomfortable and upset. Everyday I leave feeling drained and depressed, even if I had a great day with the kids and the classes were great. I don't really know what to do or say, or if I just need to grit my teeth and put up with it for the remainder of the placement. Is this something I should keep to myself and just put up with? Should I speak with my mentor (not supervising teacher, just a university support contact with no relation to the school) about this? Or is this something that I might be able to discuss with my supervising teacher? \n\nI have no clue how to navigate this. I’m very mindful that I am just a guest at the school and I don’t want to do anything that may cause issues for the staff, my supervisor, uni or myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: thank you to everyone who shared their perspective and responded to my post. I just wanted to clarify that I wasn’t trying to be judgemental, no where in my post did I suggest that she was a bad person or educator. Nor do I think that. I was just struggling with hearing this for the first time from a teacher. I’m sorry to anyone I upset or offended with my initial post, I’ll do my best to just get on with placement. I now know it’s not my business and won’t discuss this any further with anyone.",

And yes, I will take everyone's advice, and will go talk to a trusted adult about this.\n\nHowever to explain why I haven't. I was, and still am, worried about being brushed off and dismissed as just 'exaggerating things', because it had happened in the past. I understood before I posted this that this behaviour wasn't 100% ok, but didn't realise that it seemed as bad as what everyone is saying (Because he didn't physically do anything). I'm going to discuss with some classmates and perhaps file something in combination to support with more evidence and testimony. Thank you for your concern.\n\nCW: Potential sexual misconduct (?)\n\nI am in Victoria and have recently started my ¾ biology class and have a (M40-ish) biology teacher. Although he seemed ok at first, he soon started mentioning making what I would consider to be at the least weird comments, gestures, and questions. Things such mentioning sex, what seems unnecessarily much for an introductory topic about DNA (Gene expression, protein synthesis etc. Nothing really in the course about reproduction). Specifically mentioning our parents having to have sex to make us (the class), and sometimes insinuating things relating to the students as well. He also has a ‘gag’ of asking a question to a student, requiring a specific, (usually) one word answer. Then he would proceed to moan (?) at the response, getting increasingly sexual(?) in tone as he asked the student to repeat the phrase again. To making us remember it better is what I presume the purpose of it is.\n\nHe would eventually end either of these with something like ‘Oh I shouldn’t talk about these things at school’ or that he should ‘Go out more.’ This happens every other class, to most of his classes to my knowledge, but a fair bit more in my class especially.\n\nIt is somewhat known in the student body, or at least those who have taken his classes that he’s a bit creepy, at least to the older students. However, is not known to have physically done anything, nor pursued a private relationship with a student (at least still in the school)\n\nI have had past experiences surrounding grooming and SA, related to teachers, so I don’t know if I’m being too sensitive about this. I am unsure also that because he is a biology teacher, if this would be appropriate in the context of it being a biology class, alongside that he does not single out a particular student?\n\nI really don’t know if this is even misconduct or reportable behaviour and would not like to accuse anyone of wrongdoing when they have not done so.\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI have found myself reading through this sub more and more over the last couple weeks, reading about your experiences in the world of teaching, positive and negative, as I become more serious about potentially pursuing this as a career path.\n\nA brief background, I am a business degree graduate, with a career focused in Finance, however, I have become incredibly disillusioned with the mundanity of the roles and the field. However, whilst in those finance roles, the projects I worked on that I enjoyed the most were those where I was carrying out trainings for colleagues, developing learning materials, and just simply helping people understand concepts that we were working on. With that said, I had never even considered teaching in the past. I have recently engaged in some career counselling and one of the occupations they raised as something that I would likely enjoy is teaching. This then sparked something in me to research this further.\n\nThis leads me to why I am writing this post. I would love to get advice from this sub on teaching as a career in Australia. \n\n1. What is the best way to approach this transition as someone with my background?\n2. Key considerations in terms of lifestyle, work-life balance etc, primary vs secondary? Public vs Private?\n3. Is it possible to do a Masters in Teaching full-time whilst also working full-time?\n4. I have read that a good approach is first trying the role of SLSO and then transition?\n\nAny other sage pieces of advice is welcome! Also, if any of you have gone through something similar to me in terms of wanting a career pivot, I would love to hear your stories!",

Looking for general advice and life stories 📷  I’m currently in my second year of my dual degree of secondary education with a Bachelor of Arts (majoring in History and English) with the University of Queensland. I work part-time as a teacher’s aide where I go between high school and primary school (I asked for more opportunities with younger kids) and currently second guessing EVERYTHING.  \n\nI have only undergone one placement last year that involved working within a special school which I hated and have no interest, whatsoever in pursuing that field (confused as to why the uni would priotise that experience for our first ever experience in education!) and I have discovered that I am not the hugest fan of the support group I have to guide as part of my teacher aiding and dealing with difficult students...which leads me to question if I am in the right profession. When I dreamed of being a English teacher it involved grading essays, reading novels with my students and helping advanced and motivated students to reach their potential...now that seems the furthest thing from what I can achieve as it is likely that when I am a graduate teacher I will teach Year 7 English classes (yay...!)\n\nOverall, I’ve promised myself and my parents that I will see this degree through (after dropping out of nursing prior to beginning this degree). A huge motivator for me completing this dual degree involves the prospect of my BA and the opportunities that comes with a major in English/History (highschool dreams of becoming a publishing editor). Moreover, I hope to migrate to the UK after I graduate and pursue either becoming a au pair, a private nanny (is that even plausible?) or a teacher (open to other professions but just listing atm). \n\nIn essence, I am asking for advice. Is completing this dual degree worth it despite my dislike towards the job? Has there been any other success stories involving people utilising their degree to jump aboard other careers?

What I do need is the school diary, that I can ONLY purchase through the supplier and ONLY by purchasing the entire booklist. \n\n\nI get it. Public schools get fuck all money and we aren't allowed to make parents pay for shit any more. But forcing me to buy extra stationary is bullshit. We're in a cost of living crisis. I have spent $100s on my class/students as a teacher, but that is my choice. No one is making me do it. Don't make me purchase things we already have.",

  "selftext": "Hello, I thought it would be good to get some teachers views on this. \n\nI left highschool about 7 years ago and am back in my hometown for the holidays. As part of my trip home I dropped by my old (public) highschool for a bit of nostalgia, and a bit into the school grounds to show my girlfriend where I'd gone to school. Before entering we saw a lady walking around the school grounds with her two toddlers, so we thought it would be okay to do (while noting the 'no trespassing signs' at the front). We were there for about 5 minutes and just had a look at the general quad area as well as looked into some classroom windows that I recalled having classes in a number of years ago. I'm planning on retraining as a teacher from my current legal career so have been very nostalgic about my time in highschool recently. \n\nWhile leaving i noticed some cctv cameras which may have captured us walking in and out, and in the school.  This got me thinking, is this something we could have gotten in trouble for? ( it is obviously illegal to trespass on school grounds which we were technically doing, but is it something that would be enforced at your school?) Are teachers bothered by people wandering into school grounds during school holidays, and is it very common in your experience? If there was a break in at the school in the next week and the cctv footage was reviewed, would we be likely to get in trouble? Relatedly, how long do schools usually hold cctv footage for ( I assume a few months). Thanks in advance for any answers - there was never cctv cameras at school when I was there, and indeed I had schoolfriends who used to go and skate around the school grounds on weekends, but I'm not sure if this activity is becoming less accepted or not?

It's disheartening to see how technology is often used for administrative tasks, rather than truly supporting us in our classrooms.\n\nMy partner happens to be a software engineer specialising in AI, and he's been moved by the struggles we face as educators and has decided to channel his skills into creating something meaningful. Together, we built an educational tool that focuses on using AI to transform class and lesson information quickly into practical and comprehensive lecture plans.\n\nIt’s still in its early stages, but we've created a simple lesson planner that takes into account factors like year/level information, student differentiation and lesson outcomes and  generates comprehensive lesson plans that can be easily shared. We've also included a feedback form on the site because we genuinely value your input as teachers.\n\nRight now, we shared it with just a small group of teachers and now believe it's time to open up the conversation and gather broader feedback. And who better to ask than you, the incredible teachers of r/AustralianTeachers?\n\nWe would be incredibly grateful to hear your thoughts on our AI lesson planner. Do you think it could be a valuable tool to support your teaching journey? Are there any other challenges or obstacles you face daily that you believe technology could help address? Our goal is to ensure that this technology doesn't add to your workload but instead offers genuine support and empowerment.\n\nIf you're interested in checking it out, you can find it here: [https://classplan.io/](https://classplan.io/)",

I went to a similar school myself but religiously the makeup was different (mostly Vietnamese and Chinese recent migrants). This is a large Muslim population from the Horn of Africa. It is a very conservative interpretation of Islam.\n\nI am a humanities teacher and often issues of rights and tolerance arise naturally. I’m well read on matters or religion and have studied the Quran and Islamic politics and even lived in a Muslim majority country for a time. I get it. It helps me build relationships with these kids that other teachers can’t.\n\nBut there are attitudes to homosexuality that are abysmal. I don’t overtly argue with these kids as I don’t think doing so helps change the minds of teenagers. I question deeply to understand their position and insert minor corrections where they have a passage of the Quran wrong. Mostly I underline that the very very clear and repeated message of the Quran is that judgment is for Allah and that the role of people on earth is to love one another. That helps. But it’s exhausting. \n\nThese conversations are fruitful but I spend this time suppressing a simmering rage at the fact that I have to talk about this, that these kids won’t just accept people for who they are. It’s made the culture of the school one which allows all manner of minor homophobia. Things like referring to something as being “gay” as a put-down, which is a phrase I thought was cast out long ago.\n\nIt effects the non-Muslim kids too. Teen boys always love an opportunity to put a minority down and so it is that this has become culturally accepted at (NOT by) the school.\n\nI was at another school a few kms away with a similar demographic just last year and it was the GAYEST school ever. So accepting and celebrating of who people are. It was a super safe space.

  "selftext": "Schools across the country seem to be plagued with a shortage of teachers. I've seen so many listings, especially for Science and Maths teachers. A common reason given for the shortage include people leaving the profession in droves due to poor working conditions and pay.\n\nIt seems like the shortage of staff depends quite significantly on their subject area, at least in the realm of High School education. \n\nI have little doubt that this proposal will be shouted down, downvoted, etc, but please hear me out.\n\nWhy couldn't free agency be given to schools to pay staff as they see fit? So for instance, if there's a struggle to find a teacher of Biology, the school could look at their budgetary situation, and then advertise the job at a rate which is likely to persuade somebody to work at their school. If the rate of renumeration could be set by the market, I feel this could go quite some way to fill vacancies in the short term, and limit the amount of teachers leaving the profession for 'greener pastures' in other industries. In addition, it would persuade teachers to specialise in specialisations which have the strongest demand. \n\nI understand this poses several possible issues, one, of course, being the perceived inequity of paying a teacher of Mathematics more than a teacher of Art. The second issue is that it may make employment seem competitive, where schools try to 'steal' staff off one another.\n\nRegarding the first point, in broader non-governmental world of recruitment, the rate of salary is set to meet demand, wherein people within the same company, performing a similar role, may get paid different amounts. This is an accepted reality. I don't see any overly convincing reason as to why this should be particular problematic in the world of education, aside from jealousy (though even currently there's no shortage of jealous regarding iniquities in loads, timetable allocations, etc).\n\nThe same is true of the second point, where, in a free market, institutions will compete for the best of a pool of employees by offering them perks and the salary required to win them over.\n\nI feel that a free-floating salary, rather than one tied to a scale would ultimately raise salaries for teachers across the board, address shortages, bring more teachers into the profession and help stymie the losses of talent which are occurring as we speak.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know your thoughts.",

  "selftext": "Not looking for solutions, I just need to vent this out.\n\nWorking as a full time high-school teacher is destroying my life.\n\nI'm autistic-- not out to my school, or anyone really. I have been working as a relief teacher for the last two years; I did my first year of teaching in 2020 and it almost killed me. I couldn't eat and didn't properly sleep for the entire year; I lost over10KG because of it. The autistic burnout, perfectionism, and working with a school that controlled what I ate, my medication and what I wore - as well as give me some of the roughest classes in the school - and I barely made it out alive. \n\nThe last two years of relief changed my life, for the better. I got my freedom back - I could work as much as I wanted to, mark NAPLAN and the Year 12 externals for the extra cash, and could build hobbies. I was free from autistic burnout - I couldn't take work home so I couldn't stress myself out over it. I got to leave when school finished. It was great. I was actually happy.\n\nFlash forward to now. I did some short contracts to boost my holiday pay at the end of the year, with my main school. I was asked to continue those contracts - two classes, and the rest internal relief. Sounds like a dream, right? That didn't happen. In the last week of Term 1, they told me they could only guarnatee a year's worth contract - which I need to get a house - if I took on .8 classes - all junior secondary - PLUS one line of internal relief (full time). I agreed because I didn't want to ruin the relationship with the school, and agian, I need it for housing.\n\nTwo weeks into the term and I'm already distraught. I'm mostly on top of my planning but the perfectionism from being autistic is hurting. The PTSD from my teaching in 2020 is back in full swing: I can't eat again, all I talk about is how much I hate school, and I'm working until 1AM. The classes I've been given are, again, some of the roughest in the school; the school is supporting me but I can't take it. \n\nAll of this is on top of the fact that I'm still eight months out of an emotionally abusive, long-term relationship and have to live out of my brother's bedroom, with my pets stuck at their house with a ticking timebomb on getting housing for them. I can't even rent with housemates because of the autism, and the rental crisis makes renting at *all* impossible. I'm stuck. Utterly stuck. I hate teaching again.\n\nThe only thing I can do is keep going, but I'm back to crying every day again. Fearful of a kid screaming in my face, flipping me off when my back's turned, emails from parents saying I'm not doing enough, or having photos of me taken by students. I can't go to the school for support on being autistic because it's so easy to then discriminate against it; I don't want to be an 'other', or seen as a freak, by staff - again. Being surrounded by teachers having mental breakdowns at your school at least once a week isn't great either. \n\nNo solutions, just sad.

  "selftext": "This might be a controversial opinion. I’m about to finish my MTeach and I can honestly say that the amount I’ve learnt is extremely little compared to the length of my degree (two years). I think a teaching degree should be run more like an apprenticeship where a student teacher is matched with a teacher for a year, maybe they work with their mentor 2-3 days a week and spend one day a week on pedagogical research. This model would work even better if student teachers were paid an apprenticeship wage (not much, but something!). \n\nI honestly feel like the second half of my degree was majorly dragged out and I’ve had to rewrite essays on the same major ideas over and over again. It’s gotten to the point where I can copy and paste paragraphs and paraphrase them and they’re completely appropriate for a new assignment. I also think there’s a lot of common sense that’s overemphasised in the course. For example, we spent a whole week talking about why we should maintain good relationships with our students. No shit! You don’t need an academic journal to tell you that. This is also going to sound controversial but there’s a lot of identity politics at play too. I’m a WOC myself and am no means homophobic, but I don’t think it’s necessary to spend weeks discussing the importance of embracing queer identity in the classroom or by discussing what cultural identity means to us. Come on, that’s just a bit of pandering. I’m a chemistry teacher and it will not really be relevant for me to discuss queerness in the classroom, unless it became a student wellbeing issue. I also find it a bit disrespectful to paint certain teaching strategies as effective at engaging Indigenous students, like place-based learning. In the situation that you had an Indigenous student in your class, wouldn’t you discuss with them and decide on appropriate teaching strategies from there? I don’t think it’s right to assume that all Indigenous peoples hold the same values or respond the same way to pedagogical strategies.\n\nAm I alone?

  "selftext": "I just wanted to share a story about a casual day just as a reminder of what a school should NOT do. I wonder if anyone else has had a similar day to mine here. The exec in charge of casuals here let me down, let the classroom teacher down and most importantly let the students down. Warning it’s very long haha\n\nI always like to arrive about an hour before school starts, especially if it’s my 1st day at the school…which it was. I arrived at 8:00am with lessons starting at 9:00am. This is primary. The office staff were very nice and welcoming and told me just to wait for “Debra” (not real name) who is their deputy and in charge of casuals. I sat down and it felt like a very welcoming atmosphere. This seems like it will be a good day.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes they found Debra and she introduced herself. She seemed very nice, gave me the Induction forms to sign but then said “Sorry we have a meeting this morning so I need to rush off - go have a cuppa in the staff room”. It was 8:15am and I know that staff meetings can last for 30 minutes so I quickly interrupted “Okay what class am I on?” She said it will be a Stage 1 class as they all have a planning day (off site)…but all teachers have left work so not to worry.\n\nI probably should have been more forceful - I want to look at that work NOW and use the next 45 mins to plan the day (but didn’t know what classroom to go to). So I sat in the staff room alone because all the staff were in the meeting, and I didn’t want to interrupt it. The other casuals eventually joined me and we all waited there. It was 8:30 then 8:40…and I really just wanted to know THE CLASS so I could read over the notes (or even just turn the computer on). We were all sitting and doing nothing. We worked out ourselves - 4 casuals, 4 Stage 1 classes, we could plan the day ourselves if we wanted to haha We all just wanted to get into our classrooms!\n\nAt 8:45am (15 mins before class starts) I decided that I need to know the class so I can read over the notes in the room. I quietly walked into the staff meeting and asked Debra what class and if I could head over to that class now. She was nice but just said “It will only be a few more minutes, I’ll walk you all over then”. I left and didn’t argue because it was awkward being in the staff meeting. All she needed to say was 2 syllables “1G” but she chose not to haha\n\nIt was now 8:50am and 10 mins until class starts. Debra finally leave the staff meeting and then starts talking to another teacher for about 2 minutes while 4 casuals look on. So it was now 8:52am and Debra finally smiles and acknowledges us. She says welcome and starts by showing us the toilets, printers etc and I feel like screaming “I’ve been in here for an hour and already worked out where those things are!!!!!” haha\n\nI then try and ask as nicely as possible “What class do I have?” which seems to be the only thing she hasn’t told me. Debra cannot remember which casual is on which stage 1 class and says to wait and she’ll get the casual folders. She slowly waddled away and another teacher approached her. I almost screamed again “DON’T YOU DARE TALK TO DEBRA” haha\n\nFinally Debra returned in slow motion and gave us the folders (those would have been nice to read through an hour ago) and I finally found out the most important information - I was on 1G and recess duty! Debra walked us out of the office and the bell rang - it was 9:00am. Debra walked us over to where the stage 1 students were lined up. She showed us each class. I looked at my class and tried to hide my nervousness as I had no idea what we’re doing today or what complex learners or medical issues I have in front of me (because I have no time to read about them).\n\nDebra unlocked the stage 1 rooms and then left and just said “have a good day”. I walked my class into the room and they sat down fine. I quickly glanced at the teacher’s notes and it was a few pages long with random units of work photocopied with links and literacy groups and pages of instructions…and I looked up at the students (who were overly excited and loud and waiting) and I groaned. I made the decision to completely abandon the plan for the morning at least. The first activity was a good morning song on the IWB (which will not work for at least another 10 mins as I have only just turned it on) so that’s definitely OUT!\n\nI did my own activities! While students were working on my activities, I tried reading over the lesson plans and picked 1 or 2 lessons I could try in the middle session. For every minute I spend reading these plans, is a minute I’m not helping students in my class. I should probably read the evacuation and student medical sheets too…but when do I have time? I also have recess duty so can’t even use recess to plan anything. I could take the notes out to recess duty but NO - my eyes need to be on the playground and not reading the lesson plans.\n\nThe day was fine and I did 1 lesson from the plan and also the afternoon art activity (I had 40 mins of lunch to myself so I finally had time to read the lesson plans with only 1 hour left of learning). I feel like I deserved to relax for that entire 40 mins of lunch but I spent at last half of it organising the art activity from the plan. So I did 2 lessons from the plan and scrapped about 5. Especially literacy groups with a paragraph on what each group was doing. Casual teachers should not be reading through lesson plans and gathering resources with students in front of them waiting.\n\nI explained in the note left to the classroom teacher than I was not able to follow your very detailed and well thought out plan (that you probably put a lot of work into) because of the staff meeting and I was not able to enter the classroom until 9:00am despite arriving an hour earlier. I totally blamed the school and that the other casuals in stage 1 were in the same situation. None of us followed the lesson plans very well and the other casuals also said they didn’t have enough time to go over those plans or find resources. So much work went into leaving those detailed plans.\n\nSo while the students were very nice, the office staff were very nice, and the staff overall were very nice…this one staff member Debra completely let the casuals down, let down the teachers who put a lot of work into leaving notes and lessons for the casuals, and most importantly let the students down as casuals had to pull out lessons that did not relate to their programs.\n\nDebra only needed to say what class I was on at 8:15am but for some reason those 2 syllables “1G” was too difficult. If there was a staff meeting, she needed to have some other plan in place and not spew out “It Will all be fine” when I tried to ask about what class I was on. Not a good first impression and Debra just treated casuals as the last thing on her mind. Debra was nice and welcoming (and even asked about our day at the end) but was just so disorganised and everyone suffered as result.\n\nSo basically please don’t be a Debra haha",

  "title": "The behaviour management debate",
  "selftext": "Hello, in a previous school I worked in the principal said 'the one strong opinion every teacher has is about behaviour management'. \n\nIn my opinion her leadership marked a sharp decline in the behaviour of the students. This was a very high SES school but the small percentage of students with challenging behaviours essentially stopped learning a short time after she began.\n\nThey had multiple full time LSAs for behaviour management. These poor young folks new to the profession put on to babysit so the students didn't run away and they ended up getting their hair pulled, kicked and hit. They had to be full time entertainers and these children only did what they wanted to. Think any board game, lego, playground, cooking etc.\n\nOf course I understand it's the principals prerogative to allocate resources where they see fit. However in the scheme of things these students were not difficult to manage. I taught them as a release teacher in multiple subjects and they responded well to clear rules, modelling of those rules and consistent consequences when those rules were broken.\n\nMy first day of teaching the worse behaved one I modelled how to sit cross legged on the floor listening and he did it immediately. The LSA (only part time babysitter at this point) looked at me flabbergasted and said he never does that. Of course this was before the principal mentioned above when the students actually showed up. \n\nIn a rough school these would be moderate to good kids who just needed firm expectations.\n\nHere is my question. What is your perspective about behaviour management? I seemed out numbered at my school wanting to enforce consequences for behaviour. Most teachers just wanted to 'engage' the students with their interests, they would get sent to the deputy and play lego. Hate an activity and immediately be allowed to leave the classroom and go and play basketball with the lsa.\n\nMy opinion is that schools are there to socialise students and prepare them for our industrialised and digital world. They need to know how to think, behave and work as an individual and as part of a team, they need emotional intelligence and to understand others perspectives. They need self control and self discipline. Most importantly they need a foundation of understanding of the world and how it works. Sometimes students will need to memorise information, sometimes they will need to look it up. They will certainly need to complete tasks they don't like or have no interest in.\n\n(As a side note I think the rise in people like Andrew Tate is because boys aren't being taught how the world works and how to be disciplined so it's easy for them to get confused by charlatans. And then we see a marked rise in what these people preach, i.e. misogyny.)\n\nBehaviour management is a tool to force students to become these things. The best way to do that is with a gentle, calm encouraging approach where expectations are set and demonstrated constantly. With consistent, natural and escalating consequences for students who don't don't follow the rules.\n\nIf a student interrupts a lesson, they lose play time. If they destroy a classroom they clean it. I've found the severity of the consequence to be of little importance, it's the constancy that matters. If a student is interrupting. Don't sit a student out for 10 minutes of recess, sit them out for one minute, every time they don't sit straight or stop doing work or interrupt add a minute, as soon as they do the correct behaviour, give them a minute back. I've done this in autism units with iPad time and works great.\n\nOf course this only one strategy and will only work for some students in some age brackets at some schools for some teachers but the idea is the same. Consistent consequences.\n\nThe problem is when students (and parents) escalate. Teachers can do the small stuff. But with older students in  rougher schools there needs to be strict rules from the department down.\n\nAnd here is my problem with education in the western world and this is where I get controversial. There will always be a subset of students who are not meant to be in school, either their upbringing or nature has meant they are violent, deal drugs, assult people or disrupt learning on such a level they ruin schools. I'm sure we've all met these students.\n\nBy forcing these students into mainstream schools we may be helping them, but we are destroying the education of thousands of other students.\n\nWe always talk about inclusion, engagement, getting students to love learning but we force students who don't want to come to school to the detriment of all other students.\n\nThe majority of poorly behaved students would fall into line in the right environment and actually get something out of school. It is physically impossible to set that environment with truly disruptive students. For them we should actually cater to their nature. Get them out of mainstream school and  get them into a school with low ratios, strict routines and heavily modified learning such as technical schools to learn trades or use a more play based approach like we do with early childhood and go back to basics.\n\nWe already withdraw students with disabilities so severe they can't learn. Let's do that with truly antisocial students as well.\n\nTo fix our education system we need strong leadership from the departments local and federal and from politicians and ministers. That is never going to happen so it's up to teachers to force the change as usual and make our leaders work for us.\n\nOr you know leave like I did and get more money for less stress.\n\nI respect you all greatly. You lasted longer than me. I'm going to enjoy my full weekend where I don't have to spend days recovering from the trauma of the term, while not thinking about work and earning more money than I could as a teacher.\n\nSeriously if you're thinking about leaving do it. I'll save you another rant but here's the tldr, we were sold a professionalisation pipe dream and we fell for it hook line and sinker. Get out and enjoy life.\n\nFor those of you hard wired to be teachers... Love you.\n\nTLDR students need discipline and consistent, natural, escalating consequences and teachers need strong leadership from departments and ministers which we won't get. The small subset of truly disruptive students should be withdrawn from mainstream schools like we do for disabled students.",

This leads to my question: was there a move away from teaching/learning in this way at some point?

My biggest problem I find is that I am so exhausted at the end of each day. I am only 34 but find I need a nap when I get home from work just to function. I have always equated this to the fact that I am not sitting in a calm office but with high school kids for 5+ hours a day so think it is natural to be this tired.\n\nHowever, I am honestly interested in those who have worked in other professions if teaching is as exhausting and hard as it always seems to be day in and day out or if this is just the same as other professional jobs?\n\nThanks for the insight! :)\n\nCheers",

I can't actually see anything that would preclude me from having science + biology - is there some sort of rule that the \"2 units in a specialist area\" for the general science method cannot be the same as those being used for another teaching area or something? Do these units have other requirements (I've studied lots of sciences, but not such a variety at level 3, for example)\n2. While I can see that the wording is slightly different between the two degrees (Primary + Secondary requires \"prior study in at least two single teaching methods, or one double teaching method\", while secondary requires you to \"qualify\" for two single or one double), am I understanding correctly that this means the requirements are actually less strict for the former, despite both degrees qualifying you as a secondary teacher with two methods? Isn't that a little strange?\n\nI've put secondary as my first choice, so now I'm panicking a bit and wondering if I need to flip around my preferences for all the places I've applied to. The alternate method they gave me was \"technology\", but they don't even have that listed on their specializations so I have no idea what that'd entail (and science is my passion, I don't want to take something random if I don't have to haha).",

I never saw any evidence of the report and and my boss who filled it out said that the Child Story decision tree said it didn't warrant a full report. I've heard multiple classroom teachers make comments/jokes about this child's \"proclivities\" (thinking about their comments makes my blood boil).

I have brought it up several times and get the sense that my shifts will get cut if I bring it up again (this has happened before). I am regularly worried sick about this situation and feel that these little children are being failed, as well as this older child not being given the opportunity to be diverted from this path or understand what put them on it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that I don't have access to the full picture, but I've seen this have a massive effect on the children being bullied and have genuinely no idea what to do, I know I won't be supported if I try and make another report but I don't know what else to do as I'm not studying in the Ed sector and don't really have a full idea of the system.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyself and other staff have tried to do the best we can to prevent anything major happening again, but I don't think the child's school/teachers are putting anything in place either.\n\nI constantly feel like I'm failing all the children involved and am wracked with guilt but I genuinely have no idea what I can even do about it",

I can't really reply to each one individually at the moment so just made this quick edit to say I've read all of them and really appreciate the feedback!\n\nHi Teachers!\n\nI'm in the penultimate year of my teaching degree (English and History subject areas for secondary school) and the subject of employment has been on my mind a lot. The vast majority of my peers have English and/or History as their subject areas (or both) and I'm basically worried that I won't be able to find a job after grad due to the sheer amount of English/History trained teachers. I'm in Sydney and would preferably look to work here after graduation.\n\nI was wondering... is my concern rational? I realise that in every profession (law, dentistry, trades etc..) you basically aren't guaranteed to just 'get' a job after grad with little to no rejection, however I'm just concerned I might find it especially difficult to land a full-time role. Is this your experience? How did you guys go with getting your first job after grad? Does your current school often hire/have full-time jobs for recent graduates? ALSO, I was wondering if the uni you go to/completing Honours has any bearing on job prospects?",

In response to this student trying to get a rise and stir trouble, this teacher has opted to not report or take any meaningful action in response to the picture and believes that by ignoring the behavior and situation, they can earn the respect of the student and create a better relationship.\n\nSince this teacher disclosed that they received this picture and were doing nothing about it I have felt conflicted and unsure and I am just looking for some guidance as I don’t want to get anyone fired or ruin anyone's lives, but I also don’t want to be irresponsible, and even further I don’t want to get a reputation as a gnark or ruin any future prospects of making friends with teachers at this school if they know I reported a co-worker.\n\nSorry for the long post Tl:Dr is a co-worker received an illicit image depicting drugs and drug related items and chose not to act, now I am conflicted as to what my responsibilities or actions should be.\n\nEdit: I have not actually seen the picture that the other teacher was sent, it was only brought up in conversation.\n\nEdit 2: The teacher indicated to me that it was a bong and some marijuana pictured, I noticed some confusion in the comments and perhaps this will clarify.",
