They wanted to know if I was as ‘terrified as they were’ about the rise of “wanton violence” and immorality they had just made the fuck up (all evidence shows violent crime lower than any time on recent history here). When I told them the facts didn’t support their claim at all, they said we didn’t have to worry, because God was coming to kill all the sinners and we should rejoice in the “Good News”. \n\nIn the grand scheme of things, two lying pastors trying to spread their scam doesn’t amount to much more than an annoyance. I’m certain Christians would say I’m making a mountain out of a molehill. But from my perspective, I had two strangers violate clear warnings to stay off my property because they felt entitled to lie to my face and attempt to exploit my fear for their ends. They did not hesitate to ask me in celebrating the forthcoming deaths of everyone they see as an enemy. \n\nThe only difference between a cult and Christianity is the amount of followers. Both are all too eager to use the same tactics to exploit the scared and fearful, and they’re actively recruiting for terrible ends right now. \n\nThis isn’t a Christian nation and they remind me why it must never be.

Human nature inherently drives them to worship love.\n\nIf restrictions are placed upon love, this flame will only grow larger and larger.\n\nThere is a contradiction in your religion and nature.\n\n**Note 1**:  \nIslam does not provide the \"chance\" for boys and girls to indulge in LOVE with each other.  \nAt age of 6, a small girl could be married by her Father, even without asking her consent.  \nSo, what chance she has to become an adult, and to fell in love of any boy of her own age?\n\nSimilarly, Islam prohibits the interaction even between boys and girls. Islamic families consider co-education schools and universities to be HARAM.  \nHow could then boys and girls could know each other, and could fell in love with each other?\n\nBut despite all these restrictions, even Muslim boys and Muslim girls fell in love with each other , and they wish to see each other often.\n\nTherefore, many times they **rebel** against Islam and their families and they don't consider their love to be immodest or shamelessness. They meet with each other secretly despite all the restrictions.\n\n**Note 2:**  \nReligious elements try their best to declare Valentine's Day to be an EVIL, which betrays the young boys and girls in name of love.  \nThey force the shops to not to sell the flowers on this day, or to sell the love wish cards, or presents on this day.  \nBut despite their preaching against love and Valentine's day, still millions of Muslim youth celebrate it, and exchange gifts with their lovers, No force succeeds in putting restriction upon their love.\n\n**Note3:**  \nSince both sexes are unable to interact with each other, and the marriage age of a boy in Islamic countries has reached 25 to 30 years, that is why Muslim youth are super frustrated sexually.  \nThis Frustration is seen when there happen a lot of incidents of rape of small children who go to Islamic Madrassas to learn Quran.  \nIt is so much worse that even dead bodies of girls/women are being taken out of their graves, and then raped.",

Pique their curiosity, but even this really only works with those Xtian’s who have retained their critical thinking skills. But you will never be able to just lay down some 100% logical or reasonable argument because doing so triggers their persecution complex and fear. Once you’ve triggered that, there’s no going back. You have just solidified the verse in their brain they’ve had memorized since kindergarten. “You will be hated by all for my namesake. But everyone who endures will be saved” Matthew 10:22. \n\nSo not only is the Xtian you’re trying to reason on the defense, you have fulfilled the prophesy that they will be persecuted because of their beliefs. So instead of reasoning with them, you’ve just ensured they double down on the very faith you wish for them to abandon. \n\nSo STOP trying to logic and reason with these people.

They were one of those families that attended mass on major holidays such as Easter when this took place. The family was hanging around and chatting and, while they were distracted, my mother spots a small vat of holy water, as churches have those out. \n\nApparently, basically anyone can baptize anyone as long as they have holy water and the incantation. There are other rules, but I care little what they are. \n\nI don’t know how my mother ended up holding the baby or for how long but at one point she snuck away and baptized the kid. Just put some holy water on the head of a child that isn’t hers and said an incarnation over him that makes him secretly Catholic and the parents don’t know to this day. She’s told this story to some immediate family on multiple occasions with a smile on her face. I’ve tried to say that this kinda rubs me the wrong way (to say the f*cking least) but again, she’s proud of the fact that she made this kid Catholic and he nor his parents know. \n\nThe audacity.\n\nEdit: I understand that yes, it’s not recorded and it doesn’t count, I’m just in awe of the narcissism surrounding it",

  "selftext": "I’ve been pretty deep down the rabbit hole of researching Occultism, Satanism, and was a Born Again Pentecostal Christian when I was younger. \n\nI feel like I have all the pieces in place, but I’m no expert or Professor of Religious Studies, to prove Christianity was all just a big Cult to begin with, just like the Branch Davidians. \n\nTo Start, my pieces are:\n\nThe Aristocratic Italian Families like the Mossimo Family, Flavian Family and a bunch of other Italian Families all have their hands in what is known today as Christianity and Catholicism. They were like the English Royal Family starting a Religion today, then killing everyone who didn’t believe, and then 2000 years later nobody believes it. To put it simplistically.\n\nMy next piece is Christianity itself starting around the year 29ish, is widely debated among Christian Purists that Jesus’s real name was not Jesus not Yeshu(ha).. And that turns into a deep rabbit hole where that’s not even his real name, and it becomes this thing where his real name is something like Ha Alahaakka Something. It becomes what I believe to be an offshoot outlaw Jewish Cult of the times. That’s all I think it really is, is a BC renegade Jewish Cult that got taken way too seriously because Constantine decided it to be so, and then all the Italian Aristocratic Families of the Roman Empire somehow benefitted from it, by using it to control everyone. I’m putting it extremely simply again. It takes days to go through all the History, and a lot of it is suppressed. \n\nMy next piece is Judaism. I think it’s pretty easy to debunk Christianity and the New Testament, but the Old Testament, while it has a lot of plagerism from Epic of Gilgamesh, and Egyptian Book of the Dead, it has some historical relevance. And maybe the God of the Old Testament if he is real, might be an asshole, and that’s why Satan rebelled. \n\nWhat’s the smoking gun that the Old Testament written by the Jewish Writers is bullshit? What smoking. Gun invalidates Judaism? What holes can I poke in that Religion? They genocided all opposition at the time, according to their Bible. That’s also where Occultism comes in, like Moloch being a real God, because He was God of the Babylonians, and they had other Gods. I’m sure it could all be inspired by dreams, hallucinations from being ill, and hallucinations from mushrooms and being poisoned as well. \n\nI’m personally kind of agnostic, but my ultimate hope is to become a real Atheist and die in peace with no expectations for Life after death. I’m just so filled with religious bullshit. I suspect all these stories of Gods and stuff are like the folktales Pirates tell each other, but I gotta prove it. \n\nWhat is the nuclear bomb that destroys all Religions? Putting their practices and being shitty people all and all aside, what hole is there in their doctrine that proves it’s fake? Like how did Judaism start for starters?",

  "selftext": "TLDR I've been following the theism debate for 10 years and it's a waste of time. Reality is cool, focus on reality instead. \n\nThe Book of Mormon promised me - and Prophet Gordon B. Hinkley also promised me - that if I read the Book of Mormon cover to cover and prayed about it with faith, then I would receive an answer. I remember praying and not receiving an answer. I asked again like Joseph Smith: If this religion isn't true, then which one is? I decided to give God time so I went to bed.\n\nI can't remember how many days/months later, I finally caved. God wouldn't tell me which church was true, if any. I felt that I understood Morminism and theism but they weren't giving me anything, so I needed to understand atheism. Maybe God had a plan for me to continue to seek and learn. It's been 10 years of earnest searching. \n\nMaybe God needs me to be an atheist. Maybe some of us are forced to be evil, to give contrast to the good. I always wondered what was wrong with Lucifer's plan in Mormonism (Prophets Hinkley and Monson said that name is okay). Lucifer's plan was supposedly that we wouldn't have free will so that everyone could go back to heaven. It seems obvious. But God chose Jesus, whose plan was supposedly that I would experience apostasy from his church so that I could experience repentance. \n\nAnyways after 10 years of listening to debates and then having simpler versions of those same debates, I only see less value in faith or belief. Every supernatural opinion you can have is distracting you from a natural problem that actually matters to humanity. Every spiritual lesson you have is less useful to you than some philisophical or psychological lesson. Learn about what's actually real before you concern yourself with the metaphysical or the supernatural. \n\nI wish theists would hold themselves responsible for debating and researching their faith, because I can't take it seriously when someone stops a debate by saying \"You know more than me about both sides of this but I'm just not changing my opinion.\" I wish they would reasearch and schedule a second discussion, but they never do. I consume content that challenges my opinions at least 5 days out of the week (I'm terminally online and always on youtube). \n\nHeck I studied Arabic for months, I read part of the Quran, I visited a Muslim mosque, and I was shocked by how they shared almost EXACTLY the same reasons for belief that Mormons gave me! I have sought out multiple religions and God/Allah has refused to reveal anything to me or to convince me!\n\nI had a Mormon tell me I was lying. He said I didn't actually read the Book of Mormon. They can't even entertain the possibility that atheism is a thing rational people do. I study this stuff almost obsessively, but I feel so gaslit sometimes by people that think I'm fundementally wrong. I wish they would demonstrate how...\n\nThere's no honest reason to believe in God. Every reason for belief is dishonest, and it's unhealthy for you and everyone effected by your choices. I don't even need to bring up the harms of religion, it's a waste of your focus, and that should be enough reason to replace the churches with schools. In my fantasies, we teach math at the pulpit on Sundays.",

  "title": "My religion says that I can't do that",
  "selftext": "When it comes to interacting with people of different faiths or no faiths at all, I think the best approach forward can be best described as \"live and let live\".\n\n**My religion says that I can't do that**\n\nPracticing Jews and Muslims abstain from pork. Jews, Christians, and Muslims abstain from same sex marriage and sex outside of marriage. Many religions object to interfaith marriage. For all intents and purposes, religion represents the rituals that people perform out of a sense of duty. This would technically make veganism for the sake of the environment or animal rights a religious practice.\n\nForcing people to break their religious practices constitutes a serious breach in boundaries. This includes forcing people to go to a church of differing denomination (or likewise forbidding one from attending a worship service), forcing one to eat a forbidden food, or shoving religion (or lack thereof) down another's throat.\n\nParents, foster parents, teachers, and the like should be respectful of the religion of their children. Employers should likewise respect the religions of their employees.\n\nIn return, religious individuals should respect the boundaries of other people.\n\n**My religion says that you can't do that**\n\nIt's one thing to not act on your homosexuality because you religion prohibits you from doing so. It's another to impose your opposition onto other people. Just because you think that homosexuality and sex outside of marriage are immoral doesn't mean that everyone else does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK:** Not eating pork, seafood, or alcohol because your religion prohibits it\n\n**Not OK:** Harrassing others for doing so (except when someone is drinking and driving because then that person's choice affects others)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK:** Praying\n\n**Not OK:** Forcing others to pray\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK:** Not marrying or dating someone of the same sex\n\n**Not OK:** Promoting laws restricting them\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK:** Not watching porn or considering sex work a sin\n\n**Not OK:** Promoting laws banning porn and sex work**\\***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**OK:** Expressing that homosexuality and transgenderism are prohibited by your religion to fellow believers or people who are interested in learning about your beliefs.\n\n**Not OK:** Harrassing gay or trans people. Also, using dehumanizing language to describe gay or trans people including slurs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\***You better come up with a secular reason (one that doesn't depend on God existing) why it should be banned for everyone. The general reason for porn and sex work is that it degrades women. In the case for sex work, the proper solution would be to make it illegal to live off the proceeds of an individual making a profit off of sexual activity (pimping) and to pay someone to engage in sexual activity (Johns), but not to criminalize the act of performing sexual activity for compensation. This is the case in Canada, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Ireland (including North Ireland), and France.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's all about respect. You don't have to find that which you consider to be a sin as a valid lifestyle but at the very least, respect those who do.\n\nProsletyzation may constitute a slight boundary infrigement depending on how it is conducted. Islam and Christianity encourage it, meaning that there will be missionaries trying to sway others to the faith. I would say that it's ok to display information about your beliefs for those who are interested but public harrassment is not ok.\n\nThis brings us to abortion. Many Christians oppose abortion because they believe that the fetus is a human being with rights. Those for abortion primarily focus on the autonomy of the woman but generally do not share the sentiment of the fetus having rights. For abortion, to justify abortion bans, religious groups need secular support for the idea that the fetus is a living person. This will be rather difficult to prove (or disprove) since science cannot make moral judgements. Science cannot decide the point at which a person is deserving of rights. All I can say is that if you're using a verse from Jerimiah to make your case, just know that is an example of \"My religion says that you can't do that\".\n\nThe first amendment starts out with the following:\n\n>Congress shall pass no law respecting the establishment of religion nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof\n\nEvangelicals point out that the phrase \"separation of church and state\" are nowhere to be found in the Constitution. Nevertheless, Thomas Jefferson wrote the following:\n\n>Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of **separation between Church and State**\n\nHe wrote that in a letter to the Danbury Baptist Association, explaining that the establishment clause and free exercise clause both prohibit a federal church. The establishment clause prevents the church from asserting itself over the state and the free exercise clause prevents the state from asserting itself over the church.",

  "selftext": "I recognise this post has probably been made many times over but it is always more comforting to receive advice directly to one's situation rather than sift through many posts.\n\nSo, if you don't want to read my post history (don't feel obligated, lot's of cringe), I have recently come to the realisation that I will die. Not that I thought that I was immortal beforehand, just that knowing you will die and actually realising it are two very different things, so to speak.\n\nIn short about me, I am 18 years old, German, just started working and I consider myself more of an atheist. I was raised without a set belief system since my mother has some religious trauma from being brought up Catholic.\n\nFor most of my life I mostly just... existed but didn't experience. I was alive but I wasn't in my body. I was a mere observer. However, due to outside circumstances (Both of my grandmas getting a dementia diagnosis and losing their independence, my father having a health scare, my mother not being in the best shape in general and a neighbour dying of a horrific case of colon cancer) I have come to the realisation that this shit is very much real and very much finite. \n\nI don't know how to cope with this. I talked it over with both my parents and my GF. \n\nWhat mostly bothers me is this: I will never experience live outside of this body. Or rather, experience it outside of this set of eyes. My world is essentially a less than 180⁰ cone of vision and even that is shitty because I have bad eyesight. Thanks dad for those genes.\n\nAnd that too will one day be over.\nWhen I was younger (14-16) I read Camus and was heavily into meditation. Mostly for mental health reasons since I am prone to overthinking/obsessing about finding an \"answer\".\nThis answer has now shifted from identity matters regarding gender to my mortality. \n\nI try to find the right answer about death. Or rather, what I will experience when I die/when I am dead.\nFor the whole dying part, I am watching a lot of hospice content on TT/Caitlin Doughty on YT. That way I at least know what to expect.\nWhat I cannot cope with however, is the fact that I will lose my consciousness. \n\nI very much love being conscious. Well, not all the time, not when I have another depression spiral, but other times? Love smelling flowers, love drinking a nice soda. I LOVE MUSIC. I love people and I enjoy a good DND game. \nAnd I am overwhelmed with grief and terror that one day it just won't be anymore. \nOf course I won't experience the \"it not being\" part anymore since there is nothing to experience. But the leadup I can very much experience and right now, it's making me sad as fuck and also has me teetering on the edge of nihilism and antinatalism, both philosphies while somewhat sensical are just depressing as fuck.\n\nThe thought of death looms over me like the sword of Damocles. Ultimate loss of control. When I was young what I feared most was shitting myself when I die. Now I fear loss of consciousness. Probably because I realised that I am actually conscious. \n\nAs a side note, I will talk about it with my therapist today so we can at least adress the whole \"obsessing and not enjoying life\" part because I find myself not living in the moment anymore since all my thoughts are that this will end. Just this morning I woke up in terror at the thought.\n\nAll I ask from you folks is whether this will go away/I will get used to the thought. Is it an issue of me being very attached to living? Will it get better when/if I shrivel up like a raisin? The thought that this shit is inescapable really terrifies me/throws me into vertigo.",

  "selftext": "I often see people on this subreddit and in other places both online and irl argue that even though some of the smartest individuals, their belief is just a product of their time or their environment. Despite this just being an overall reductionist take, i think most atheist would and should disagree, because if this argument was used in almost any other setting it would be bigoted, which i would believe alot of atheists are here. Lets for an example take a subject that is quite a common point of disagreement between theists and atheists, LGBTQ and its legitimacy, to be clear i myself is not taking a position of homophobia just using this as an example. If i were to say to a gay, trans or otherwise queer person that what they believe about themselves isnt true, and they only believe it because their feelings and thoughts are just a product of their time or environment. Most people, atleast here, would tell me im homophobic, transphobic and in general bigoted. The problem with the \"a product of their time/environment\" is that it reduces peoples thoughts, feelings and believes down to nothing but just math and science. Now im sure there are people who view the world this way, but i think regardless its a disrespectful thing to say and i personally dont believe it to be true. The truth is that the argument is a double edged sword and it could be used to illegitimize and belief, atheism included.   \n\n\nJust as an end note to clarify my own beliefs, i would consider myself an agnostic theist. I am in no means anti lgbtq and i dont support religions persecuting them, even though i accept that they have the right to call their decision wrong and to exclude them.

Unfortunately, both of my parents happen to be two of the people that were scammed by this movement. \n\nThe Bible doesn't even mention abortion, yet they continue to deny this and point to some vague arbitrary verse. For example, I remember my mom's justification for opposition to abortion is (one version of) the 6th commandment. I nearly fell over laughing and puking at the same time. Unfortunately though, both of them have been fed anti-abortion propaganda over the last 45 years or so. I'm pretty sure they both saw the Schaeffer's anti-abortion films (look these up if you don't know what I'm talking about), and their church back in the 80s was directly involved in the anti-abortion movement (they don't know that I know this). They also believe a lot of the other falsehoods, such as a lot of women who get abortions regret them, abortion is widely used as a method of birth control, a huge share of abortions occur in the third trimester, almost no abortions happened before Roe v. Wade, etc. My mom even told me that she voted for Trump because she wanted to see Roe v. Wade overturned, despite the fact that she absolutely hates him (and won't vote for him again after January 6). I mean, it's not hard to figure out that all of these things they believe are false. But when you're fed this propaganda for 45 years, it's hard to lose. How do you counter it? Is it not an unreasonable conclusion to think that a god who is against abortion would not allow abortions (or miscarriages) to happen?",

  "title": "A plot hole in religion?",
  "selftext": "I was a muslim once, grew out of it at age 13 and ever since then never looked back but something recently occured to me. So I have heard a lot that God (Abrahamic) creates us with free will and that’s how he justifies heaven and hell based on your sins and other deeds you do throughout your life.\n\nHowever, I feel that this is somewhat against the very idea that God is an Omniscient, Omnipotent being. I believe that something like God, being as powerful as he is is so powerful and knowledgable and so full of foresight that he would know from the very moment he created me and my soul, exactly what I would be doing in my life. For example he would know that I will definitely stop believing in him due to the things I see. He would know that i would turn out to be a bisexual man. He would know that I would commit so much sin and therefore he would also know that I am - by his own measure of justice - destined for the fires of hell. \n\nSo I tried asking my childhood friend who is still muslim, about this and he simply had no idea how to tackle this, because he knows that I am making a good point, God being as powerful and knowledgeable as he is, would know exactly who goes to hell and who goes to heaven from the very get-go. Therefore, the very idea of Heaven and Hell is insulting to me as it seems that he has simply created those places to punish someone he has literally created to be that way or in other words, destined. I don’t see how else you can tackle this unless you want to concede that he is in fact now as powerful as he leads us all to believe, I simply see no other way but I would like to hear your thoughts.\n\nTL;DR: If God is Omniscient, Heaven and Hell doesn’t make sense as He would know that I am destined for hell the very moment he created me? Thoughts? (Please read the full argument before replying, you’ll get a better idea from there)",

  "selftext": "I'm even talking about the other direction. Like if people write critiques about the morality of religion, that's no longer interesting at all for me to read, even though I obviously have opinions on that matter.\n\nFor me, the veracity of a religion starts and ends with its contradictions with the physical world. Period. Magic and mythology are not observed in the universe- the universe in fact behaves predictably. Outrageous claims that they are observed always have a more likely explanation. Every time a religion does try to make a magical or mythological claim about the physical world we observe, that claim is inevitably falsified by discoveries about reality centuries or millenia later. I remember being like 10 or 11 and someone trying to show me the Bible, I read the first few lines and caught something about God creating the \"big and small light for day and night\" (I'm paraphrasing, but talking about the Sun and Moon). I immediately said to them \"this sounds much more like how ancient people would look at the sky and think, we found out later that the Sun and Moon have nothing analogous with each other\". I'm picking on Christianity but almost every culture has some story that the Sun and Moon have some special relationship to each other (through no fault of their own, given limits of human knowledge at the time, sure).\n\nAnyways, the point is I sometimes feel like the morality arguments go nowhere and don't address the crux of the issue, which is that religious claims about physical reality almost always turn out to be explanations from ignorance, convenience, or subterfuge. If we were created in a simulation by some narcissist teenager in the 10th dimension who thinks he \"loves\" us and is behaving \"morally\" but was actually completely amoral, BUT he showed up in the sky saying \"he btw I created y'all and I'll prove it\" and then showed how he can control the universe to behave to his will, then that'd be a true explanation on the nature of the physical world even in spite of all the morality arguments that fall flat.",

  "selftext": "Hi atheists! So lately in my school kids are becoming extremely religious(orthodox christians to be exact). They are talking about the bible and sharing some things that are written there (For me they sound extremely illogical). They also wear cross necklaces, watch and follow christian content in social media and write some christian things in their bios. They say that i will burn in hell for eternity and i should turn to God bc he loves me and something like that. For example one boy spams me with insta reel and tells me some cliche things. Not only that, but they are homophobic and bully one girl in my class, which is lesbian. Teachers are also part of this thing and talk to us about God and make fun of that girl. I feel really strange to be different from others. Before i forced myself to believe, even started reading the bible in order to get closer to God but this book made me even more confused. Forcing myself to believe in a thing that i don’t feel to be right didn’t work so now i am 100% myself and do what i feel with my heart and mind. There is only one boy who shares my thoughts on all of this. And these kids aren’t even stupid. My school is in top 3 of the best schools in the country. I feel like something is wrong with me and my thinking because how can so many people believe in things that sounds so unreal to me? Now in tik tok i see so many live videos where people „spread the Gospel“ or discuss some BS like „atheism is child abuse“. My parents are believers, but not really religious. Like we go to church when we go to another towns to see the landmarks. My mum says that im too young to understand how the universe works and probably when i grow up my views will change and i will start believing(im almost 16). So i want you to please share if you had similar experience when you started being an atheist and how did you deal with it. I feel like im wrong when i recieve no support. Maybe my post sounds stupid, but i really fell so strange and leftout.",

  "selftext": "I am an atheist, and I pretty sure it means that you deny any deity existence, and not something about living in this country, or eating particular food. I had this argument with teacher, who is religious. All it started when she talked about god. I said I was an atheist. She responded with \"you are actually a christian, since you live in this country.\" Now, I'm pretty sure that christian means that you believe in god, but she responded with \"actually, just because you don't believe in god, you are still an christian. You don't have to go to the church.\" Now, my brain was melting. I obviously respond with atheist definition. She then went \"do you eat this food\" (forgot what she said). and then I responded \"I eat anything.\" I tried using this fact against her, but it kinda backfired, since I said jew, and she responded that it is under Christian umbrella, or something. She also said that if I follow these holidays, or calendar events, then I am a christian. I said that I don't really follow them, I only do it, because parents and school, otherwise I don't really care. She said \"even if you do one holiday, you must be a christian.\" Then she started talking something about being in a country. I asked her \"so if I move to this country, will I no longer be christian?\" She didn't respond, and then started talking about commandments. I asked her who made them up. She said to find it on internet. She also said that if everyone followed commandments, world would be in the peace. I said if everyone followed bible, everyone would be in prison by now. She asked how. I said \"bible contains slavery and rape, and it supports it.\" She asked where did I read this. I said \"[bible.com](https://bible.com)\". She asked if I read it in English, and I answered yes. She then proceeded to say that I might've misinterpreted something. Now, I ain't perfect at English, but I know what slavery and rape means. From Ephesians 6:5-8: \"Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ. Obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from your heart. Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free.\" I am pretty sure that slave means owning people, or I am just misinterpreting something. Could be because I live in the country where only \\~2-3% of population are only atheists, and \\~50% of population hates them, and wants them not to vote or work as a teacher. Now back to point. She said something about morals, that it contains at the end of the bible, and it is up to us to decide. I was like in that \"...what?\" thought. I didn't know what the fuck to say. An then the class ended.\n\nTL:DR: Basically, teacher said I am christian because I live in this country, eat particular food, and \"follow\" holidays (idc about holidays. I do it because parents and school). Commandments are to be followed for peace. It's up to us to get morals from bible.\n\nThanks for reading, btw I don't hate religious people, or anyone.

  "selftext": "I live in America and have a friend who is pretty smart and christian. We like debating things but at this point whenever I argue with him about philosophy or religion I just feel like I'm banging my head against the wall repeatedly. This kid is about to go to an ivy league and is the valedictorian at my school. He comes from an extremely christian family and his devotion to christianity is honestly pretty off putting. He goes out of his way to try to debate with me about this stuff, and usually it comes down to him unintentionally denying science or contradicting himself while never admitting to the contradiction, using logical fallacies like circular reasoning. \n\nFor example, in one argument where he tried to prove to me that divine power exists, I immediately just started trying to poke holes in his 'evidence' and he very quickly started saying these weren't valid arguments because god has infinite power and wisdom and so he could use this power to break laws of physics(using elements of the conclusion to prove the conclusion). For another example, when he tries to use 'historical evidence' I usually claim that most of this history he's referring to is only known from scriptures that can't be validated with real-world evidence, and he just denies this being true. For yet another example, one argument came down to me telling him that through neuroscience we can attribute certain emotions and thoughts to different areas of the brain(correct me if I'm wrong), and he essentially just outright said he won't believe this over the theory of a soul even if it's proven to be true. Finally, despite the numerous logical fallacies he commits and contradictions he makes, he tries to use arguments like that of fine-tuning in our universe to prove that a god must exist for things to be this way. Eventually coming to the conclusion that the theory of god is the best theory because it is the theory that has the best balance of explanatory power and evidence. At a certain point it stops being a debate or argument and feels more like a jerk off that ends in him just worsening his own dissonance and mental compartmentalization. \n\nI'm honestly pretty sick of it but am in circumstances where I can't just avoid this person for at least the next few months. On top of this, we do share actual common interests that I enjoy talking about or partaking in with him. I've even swayed him on political issues to the point where he's pro-gun regulation, for free healthcare, and pro LGBT among other things. But his over-the-top devotion to god and his dissonance in philosophical discussions about religion have become impossible to ignore. ",

He used to steal their clothes when they used to go to bath for fun?Some of their beliefs are just straight up against  humanity especially in Hinduism where only Brahmins are lucky born who came from Brahma head while other Dalits who were outcastes came from Brahmas Feet to do cleansing jobs? Half Elephant half human (Ganesha) made from Sand and Flying Monkey (Hanuman) and Kali who will come to end Kalyug to save the whole world? only for living things to be reincarnated again? Then who created the whole world? Kali since she is the destroyer?which just seems absurd and probably this gods didn’t even existed in real life. Ram or anyone else who was straight up Fanatic and pedophile also not given the context where he asked Sita to prove his virginity test by walking on fire and exiled her into forests when she failed. Ram is the worst person you can paint as holy man when he killed a Dalit for being Dalit and Indra who was cursed being a transgender because he changed his appearance to sleep with a married woman. Most of the Hindu Gods are either pedophile or child rapists and we can’t question them since questioning a barbaric CuIt and terrorist religion like Hinduism is Hinduphobic. Science and Logic spreads Hinduphobia according to Hindus. My dream is to see India and Nepal become Atheist majority which will lead to women having equal rights and Hinduism is the reason why these two countries are 3rd world and lack basic human rights.",

Are most pop stars or whatever morally corrupt? probably. However I really doubt they are recruiting for satan. I know muslims also see jesus as a profit just not the final profit but he was talking about the anti christ and all this stuff that is just so far off muslim. I feel that the level of delusion is so high now in the face of the modern world that all the delusions are slowly melding into one.

Like they've borrowed a little from the book of the dead (like the issue were Archangel Michael would supposely weight the souls, the issue is the jugdement of Osiris is pretty similar) when it comes to jugdement, the issue where they borrowed half they myths from Mesopotamia's religions (Atthar and Baal, the issue with the universal diluvian and Gilgamesh epic) and the fact that there's a demon that represents the Ottoman Empire and the Islam itself, that, surprinsingly took down Constantinople. The pagan faiths are different, but it can resume in the fact cultures borrowed gods from others, however,  the abrahamic faiths are more spreaded and more damaging than the pagan religions because they've been coming from colonizing groups, just like the Roman Empire founding the Catholic church of how the Ottoman Empire had Islam as a principal religion. \n\nSo, i got a question for the people here that studied theology, everything works, Christian, Catholic, muslim, jewish theology. Ex priests and religious leaders too. I want to know, what led you to leave your faith? What did you found about the religion/s you were studying that made you change your mind?

Many of these people also have an \"ends justify the means\" mentality which is how religious extremism can lead people to commit atrocities like suicide bombings, and was used to justify torturing athiests not that long ago, the crusades, the inquisitions, manifest destiny, etc.\n\nThis manifests itself in ways that are actually detrimental to the continued survival of the human race, because they are incapable of considering that they might be wrong, which leads them to ultimately not care much about the world we are living in now, because they think there will be something better after. This also means there is little incentive to actually improve the world we live in.\n\nThis causes people to ignore real issues that we do actually have evidence for, such as climate change, because they think that their God will perform a miracle and fix the environment, so there is no need to worry about or fix a problem if our own creation.\n\nThey usually ascribe to some form of Pascal's wager saying things like \"If you are wrong, you gain nothing and lose everything, but if I am wrong I gain everything and lose nothing\", but they do lose something: their one life. All of that time spent worshipping and dedicating their life to an imaginary diety is time they will not get back, which is the real tragedy.\n\nAt an individual level, that may not much of an issue, but at a societal level, it causes real harm, because it doesn't take into account the very real suffering they continue to perpetuate (either directly or indirectly). The continued oppression of LGBTQ people, child abuse, the rampant misogyny baked in, and even slavery was justified by the Bible.\n\nImagine a world where people are killing each other over whether Star Wars or Star Trek is real, that's what's going on, and it's insane to me.",

(Because freedom of religion also means freedom FROM religion).  And because I believe in individual freedom.\n\nI also believe in a lot of what Jesus, if he existed as the Gospels generally state (forgiving this or that contradition), stood for.  Not all.  But I think a common criticism that many of us have for a lot of Christians in general is how much they appear to love to be Christians but are not Christ-like in the slightest.\n\nI'm a musician.  I don't do a lot of church services.  I used to be more of a classical type of player so I would do traditional services with traditional music.  Now I'm more of a rock, swing, jazz musician.  I'm hired every now and then to put together a dixieland group for a Methodist church.\n\nI really feel for this congregation.  Put on your surprised faces, but there is a schism in the Methodist church.  The official policy is one of intolerance towards LBGT behavior.  This church came out strongly in support of this group, indeed of any and all people.  They have been in danger for a while now of losing their building because of this.  Also, this split the congregation so attendance is down.  Normally I'd be lol'ing about this and referring to leopards and faces, but, then I listen to the pastor's sermons...\n\nAnd I've listened to a lot of sermons/homilies in my life.  I grew up catholic though I was consciously an atheist by the time I was 10 years old.  Still, church every week until I left home.  I've played countless lutheran services.  Ugh, the sermons are just so fucking annoying and empty and full of scripture.\n\nBut this Methodist pastor, he always has something poignant to say.  Messages of fraternity, of loving your neighbor, of loving your enemy, of humility, of mindfulness.  Only when at the end when he briefly brings it back to Jesus do I feel like \"ugh you HAD to ruin it!\"\n\nHonestly, if religion was only about this, I wouldn't be anti-religion at all.  I still wouldn't be a believer because that is simply a question of evidence and nothing more.  And while one of the reasons I am anti-religion is that it seeks to stop the search for the actual truth of the universe, I dare say that churches like this one still are a net positive to society.  I almost feel bad cashing the check.\n\nI hesitate on expressing to the pastor my appreciation because the last thing I want is \"hey, you should join our church\" which will lead to a conversation I just don't want to have.  But I did so anyway.  Fortunately, he didn't try to recruit me.\n\nAnyway, I felt it was time for a \"vent\" here that was a little more positive even though I wonder if it will be well received here.  Again, I'm a big card carrying atheist who blames religion for a lot of the worlds problems.  But there are people in some of these churchs that are good, kind, compassionate, open minded, inclusive.  If their church folds, I will be sad.",

However we continue to do certain things we did growing up. For example,\n\nWe celebrate Christmas and have the nativity scene sculptures. We have a tiny Christmas village we put up that has a church. We also go to church once around Christmas. It’s because I love some of the stories in the bible. The birth of Jesus is a beautiful story to me, that brings me peace. However I see it as just stories and not real and we teach our children the same. I also like the church feels around Christmas with the stained glass windows, decoration and choir music. For us, it’s like a cultural trip. My children see these as stories as well.\n\nWe also celebrate Ramadan & Eid. We don’t fast from food but will fast with other things (for example, social media, junk foods, video games etc) for cleansing and spiritual reasons (not related to religion but more so in tune with our inner self, we have a lot of deep talks and self reflection). Our husband family is still religious, so we will join them for dinners, dress up and exchange gifts and stuff.\n\nBut that’s it. We like telling people we are culturally Christian and Muslim. There are certain things in the bible and Quran that we follow and teach our children, like loving your neighbour and doing good deeds. But we don’t believe in God or take any stories at literal. We teach them that, these stories are meant to teach us something just like many other non religious stories.",

But if you watch any of these videos, and then look at the creators pages, a majority of them end up converting to islam. They‘ll post all these videos about how Islam has been such a positive influence in their lives, and they‘ll film themselves reading particularly „beautiful“ verses from the quran in order to show how „peaceful“ the religion is (of course, they never film themselves reading the verses talking about when it’s acceptable for a man to beat his wife, or how it’s ok for grown men to marry children, or how gay people like me should be killed)\n\nI understand that everyone‘s entitled to their beliefs, but how am I supposed to sit here and watch people talk about how beautiful and peaceful a book that calls for me to be put to death is. I don’t find it beautiful at all. I think it’s grotesque, abhorrent, and a blight on society. \n\nWe can talk about freedom of religion all day. Sure, you have the legal right to be a muslim, to believe in the word of the quran. But at what point do your rights end and mine begin? Me existing as a gay man is in no way discriminatory towards anyone, muslim, christian, jew etc. But the same can not be said in the reverse. Your religion is inherently discriminatory, abusive, and oppressive to me. \n\nI know it sounds like I‘m just unfairly singling out islam, because obviously all abrahamic religions have similar verses about gay people being put to death, but the main reason for this post was in direct response to the TikTok trend, which happens to be specifically about islam.

  "selftext": "I really find it weird that so many christians shun people that are so similar to their supposed god/ messiah. Because if there even was one man named Jesus as described in the bible, the guy was seriously witchy af and super gay. If the bible is to be believed, Jesus did literal magic in the name of his god and had a pretty serious bf.\n\nJesus most commonly used his magic to heal people, and usually could do so with just his words, but oddly enough, other times he'd need to spit in mud, or use special water, including his spit, have people bath or run, not look back and sometimes just by touching or being touched. It makes more sense he was casting spells, because if he was an all-powerful god, why not use just use his word alone? Why use materials? It makes more sense he was a sorcerer. Further proof is the other spells he cast. He could transmogrify and duplicate items, control the weather, command spirits and animals, walk on water, curse and kill plants, and pass without a trace, almost always needing physical or spoken components. The dude had a pretty diverse spell roster even dipping into necromancy a few times and was able to raise people from the dead. Props to whatever god/gods that were his patrons, as most of these are miracles not seen anywhere else in the bible, and we haven't seen magic like this since the great warlock Moses. \n\nAs for Jesus being gay idk how this isn't common knowledge. The man was a known bachelor well into his 30's who almost exclusively traveled with 12 other men and the bible even mentions his boyfriend by name. Jesus and his apostles constantly referred to John as beloved, the one I loved/ the disciple Jesus loved, all over the bible. So much so that he even became known as John the beloved. John, at the last meal even sat on his right hand and leaned into Jesus, resting his head on his chest. He was the only apostle to actually show up to Jesus's crucifixion and Jesus asked John to take care of his aging mother, something you usually ask of a spouse or partner. When John heard of Jesus's resurrection, he literally sprinted to his grave to see him. When they all had a campfire after Jesus came back, John jealousy followed and eavesdropped on Jesus and Peter when he asked him to go for a walk. As any modern students of history, we are well aware of historians and clergy downplaying and erasing homosexual relationships (aka straight-washing) in myth and real life, like Achilles and Patroclus, Alexander the great and Hephaestion, Emily Dickinson and Susan Gilbert, Greek gods like Apollo, Zeus, Aphrodite, honestly most Greek gods, Abe Lincon and Joshua Speed/ David Derickson, the list goes on and on. Would it really be surprising that they also wouldn't straight-wash Jesus and his beloved John? How strictly does the catholic church hold on to apocryphal and historical texts? How many gospels were changed, hidden, destroyed and re-written?  I mean how can you justify hating, persecuting and murdering LGBTQA+ people when you're own god is gay!? \n\nSo for you weird christians creeping, I hope you can see the truth that Jesus, as written in your own bible, is not only pretty openly gay, but also a powerful sorcerer, and maybe take a page from Jesus's book and treat people like him how you'd like to be treated, cause the pagans and LGBTQIA+ people have a lot more in common with your god than you do.",

  "selftext": "\nTLDR: There are so many good people in churches, and churches do so much good. In my personal experience the only problem with them is that God really probably isn’t real. \n\nBefore you jump to conclusions and proceed to flame and downvote, please, just listen to my story. I’m a 34M who grew up in a small rural town in Missouri. My mom has been on drugs my whole life, never met my dad. Picture every poor white trailer park trash stereotype and that was my life. People at our house everyday all day all night. Meth labs, food stamps, welfare, all that. When I was about 6 our mailman, picked me up (with permission from my mom) and after picking up a few other boys took us to a church that had a big lawn and about 15-20 boys age 6-12 all played flag football and had a quick devotion. Since almost anything was better than being home I started going to the kids activity once a week, and later church on Sunday. Billy (the mailman) would always pick me up. The church paid our electric bill when it got shut off multiple times a year. In the winter when our woodpile would get low a big load of wood would appear magically in the morning. They brought food, would discreetly buy me shoes and clothes when mine would be falling off. One night when I was 13 and my mom and her bf were strung out and he decided to gut punch me, and then him and mom went fisticuffs, I called Billy and him and 2 other men from the church (one an off duty deputy from the next county over, the other retired military) came and got me and I stayed at Billy’s for 2 nights. \nI could literally tell another 100 stories like this. It wasn’t just Billy either, all the people in the church were great to me. The other kids didn’t make fun of me for being poor like the kids in school. Seriously, like 150 people in this small town church truly and genuinely loved and cared for me, each other, strangers, and the world. 100% had it not been for the churches influence I guarantee you I would not have went to college and i definitely would not have stayed off drugs. Still today that church hosts tee ball leagues and has a disaster response team thats the first ones out there with chainsaws and food after a tornado and does a ton of good in the area.\n\nThe only problem, as you all know, is the universe wasn’t made in 7 days and 2 of every single species on earth could not fit on a single boat and ….. well y’all know. \n\nBut seriously. If you take the impossible fables and mythos out. The church I grew up in, and from what I can see, most churches, are great… or at least bare minimum, a net positive. \n\nYes I know there are controversy’s and molestation charges and all that, I don’t doubt any of that, but churches do a lot of good. Im not discrediting anyone else’s story, I know many of y’all have had fucked up history with churches and I respect all of them, but I can’t just forget or pretend like the exact opposite didn’t happen to me.  Really, any institution that big is going to have bad apples. And just the nature of our society is that when there’s a scandal, everybody hears about it. But when a church literally does a better job at parenting a kid than his own parents, that stuff just doesn’t get mentioned nobody talks about it. \n\nI learned recently about the factors that psychologists say go into whether a person is happy or not. The most important ones being personal relationships, community, and health. I’ve seen it proposed by some that the decline in mental health over the last 20 years or so and the decline in religious affiliation over the same time could be more than just correlation. That with the way our society is structured now, in denser populations where we don’t know anything about our neighbors or the people around us like we used to, that churches, regardless of their doctrine and whether or not a bunch of that wacky stuff could have happened, filled that critical “community” leg of happiness. And my objective critical logical brain can’t help but give some validity to that point. \n\nThis brings me to why I am so cripplingly lonely. I’m an atheist, but I think churches are good. The people from my hometown church still love me and would take me back with open arms but it doesn’t feel right since I don’t believe in God. And atheist…. So quick to be SO INCREDIBLY CRUEL to and when talking about people who don’t deserve it … makes me upset and makes me want to stick up for the church and it’s people… which, let me tell you, shockingly doesn’t win you many friends in atheist circles. \n\nSort of this has been rambling but I’ve just felt like I needed to get it off my chest.",

  "title": "My problem with religion and religious arguments [long post]",
  "selftext": "I wanna start this off by saying that I don't really care what anyone personally believes in, as long as that belief causes no harm to others. However, I will not respect a person's faith in an arbrahamic God more than a person's faith in Big Foot.\n\n\nThe abrahamic Religions are sadly used as a reason to hate people of different sexuality, to wish others eternal suffering in the afterlife, to harass people who try to get an abortion, to surpress women's rights and they, in general, depict a twisted sense of morality. \n\n\nIt shocks me to see, that still so many people today choose a 2000 year old book as their moral guideline, instead of using logic and reasoning.\n\n\nI've talked to many religious people these last couple of days and asked them what convinced them of their belief. Reasons vary from completely illogical to somewhat understandable. I want to list them here, along with my critic on it.\n\n\n1. \"Nothing can come from nothing\"\n\n\nThis one I've heard the most often I think. When observing the universe, this seems to be the case, however, we can only speak for things in the universe, not the universe itself. We can't deny, that WITHIN the universe, different rules might apply than TO the Universe itself.\n\n\nWe also don't know, whether the universe always existed in some form. Theists will claim that this would be illogical but they claim that their God was always there. Even IF we had scientific proof that there must've been a creator, we'd still have no way of calling any Religion true.\n\n\nPeople will claim that it's too unlikely that the universe and we as a species exist, just because of the laws of nature. However we had a lot of time to come into existence. Think of the infinitely typing monkey that one day writes Shakespeare. \n\n\nThey will claim that it's more believeable that a God created dinosaurs just to kill them, create homosexuals just to hate them, creates animals for you to eat, except pork of course, sends his son to earth, to turn water into wine and then have him crucified by the people he created. Religious people will claim that this is more believeable than science. The same science that invented Smartphones, Rockets and can treat any illness with medicine we invented or surgical procedures we learned.\n\n\n\n2. \"The *insert holy book* is proof\"\n\n\nNo, it's not. Its historically inaccurate, mentions supernatural magic and there is no scientific proof for any important prophecy being fullfilled. Even if there were, it would be no proof, the Simpsons have predicted lots of things.\n\n\n2.5 \"We have witnesses, that Jesus was the son of God.\"\n\n\nSure. Witnesses from 2000 years ago who claim that someone turned water into wine and walked on water. Idk about you but if 100 people came to me and said person XY can turn water into wine, I'd call that a delusional cult and not an undenieable fact.\n\n\n\n3. \"I feel God therefore he is\"\n\n\nThe human mind is fantastic. It can trick itself into many things, especially if you really want it to. Placebo-effect and hypnosis work too, so I don't see this as proof of an arbrahamic God. If someone claimed they feel Unicorns, people would call them delusional.\n\n\n\n4. \"Everything is perfectly designed so there must be a God\"\n\n\nWhat does perfectly designed mean? That we die at the age of 80? Why wouldn't we live forever if we were perfect? Why would man have nipples?\n\n\nThe issue is, no matter how it was designed, as long as it allows people to have a consciousness and believe in God, they'd say the same thing. If we had 2 noses and died at the age of 30 because our stomach randomly exloded, these people would still claim that we were perfectly designed. It doesnt make any sense\n\n\n\n5. \"You couldn't have morals if there were no God.\"\n\n\nYes we can, morals are subjective to us. We use empathy, philosophy and laws to come to a collective moral understanding. Morals vary depending on the indvididual and society but there would be zero issue if there were a lack of objective, godly morals.\nIronically, religious people often don't have to give much thought to morals at all, because they can just do as their book tells them.\n\n\n\nThese are just the more repeated arguments I've still had in my head, I can add more if people are interested, but they get more and more ridiculous as we move on. Number 4 and 5 already baffle me. Would like to hear your thoughts and criticism on my or their viewpoints too. Btw english isn't my first language and I'm not too deep into this topic, I joined Theistic debates just a couple of days ago.",

Jewish atheism is quite common, as Judaism, in the present day, isn't concerned with what you believe. When you join a Synagogue, they don't typically ask you to confess belief or test you theology, instead asking you about the Jewish traditions.\n\nFor Hinduism, especially, there has pretty much always been a atheistic wing of the tradition (I say tradition instead of religion, as most Hindus in India do not consider Hinduism a religion, but rather a life path, with only loosely defined beliefs connecting the polytheistic, henotheistic, monotheistic, and atheistic Hindus. The world used to describe Hinduism in Hindi is \"Dharma\").\n\nBuddhism is, by its very inception, atheistic, or at least agnostic. Though, some Buddhists, especially in Southeast Asia, tend to revere certain enlightened people as having attained a god-like status in death, even leaving offerings at shrines for them and praying, more or less, at these same shrines.\n\nA lot of people outside the realm of atheism forget that atheism is a part of an identity that can be tacked onto anything, much like agnostic, I.E. Agnostic Christian. But, just like agnosticism, it can stand alone as the sole identity when it comes to religious preference (or lack there of).",

Having to stop due to changing practices is a terrible situation, for anyone unfamiliar.\n\nThe damage stopping drops the masks I didn't know I had. Why would God put me on these if it was designed to fail? I was told this was a lifelong thing. Obviously I understand the complications now, but being that this was part of such a big prayer in my life- it seemed like a giant, destructive waste of time. \n\nMy entire life was a prayer. That was my whole thing. This situation put into light how vulnerable I have been, and how faith was the imaginary parent.\n\nIt's strange going from a life that was all belief, a person who was so knit in that experience. Promoting new ways of mental health made having God, the threat of Hell, and leaning on my ancestors always being around suddenly not comforting. No wonder I was afraid to be alone.\n\nI realized everything in life was touched by a testy God. Realizing that I had the habit of believing the lie God would punish the bank account to keep me in submission. It's nice to suddenly realize finances doesn't have God dipping into the bank account via sudden emergencies.\n\nAll these beliefs I didn't realize was ruining everything. I had enough sense to not hold others accountable to the same torture. \n\nWe aren't encouraged to put God to the test. I made a list of prayers God didn't answer. There's enough padding in scripture to keep a believer from doing this. We find any reason as God's mysterious reasons. That the breakthrough is right around the bend.\n\nExcept all the people who died waiting for God. Accepting that God felt death was the awesome choice to yeet people out of misery seemed normal. \n\nI cringe seeing how stupid and sick this has been. A lifelong relationship that wasn't started by me, but given to me as the crisis coping mechanism instead of adults doing what they needed to do. \n\nAdding before I post I have always afforded too much forgiveness to the worst people. Not truly believing God was this toxic to anyone else. So perhaps that was the part of me that peeked out of this mess the whole time.\n\nThank you for letting me share. I know this is long and has been expressed countless times before.\n\nIt will take time getting out of the conditioning that my mind is always invaded by a supreme being.

  "selftext": "Hello community, I have been an atheist for past 5 years. My family is highly religious, one can say orthodox Hindus. All my childhood I was forced to pray daily morning after waking up, pray before an exam, basically pray to god that I am successful in  performing a task that a basic human can do. There is other stuff but you get the point.  \n\nNow that I am free from all that and also I am slowly losing interest in my career as I was forced to pick my major in college because apparently that is what everyone in my country is picking, a computer science major. All my life I was prepared to be successful by attending schools with timings like 8-6 until 10th grade and 6-10 in 11th and 12th (about 16 hrs) in order to attend a prestigious college. All because everyone is doing so. Now I am in final year of a *not so prestigious* college and actually doing pretty well, at the same time also feel burnt out and feel like losing interest in doing anything.  \n\nAnyway my point is, I have not felt this way before. I am beginning to think, as I was forced to make prayers daily, I was reminding myself of what I should achieve so that kept me in track. Now since I am not doing so I have no specific goal. Now, if blindly believing in some fallacy known as god can keep me track of my goals and lead me towards a better life, should I keep doing it even if I know god does not exist. Or should I try to understand why is god created in the first place so it all makes sense. At the end I may not even understand why it was created.  \n\nI know it is a rant but I need advice from fellow atheists.",

  "title": "Is there anything wrong with my view toward world religions?",
  "selftext": "I grew up in a Catholic household and went to Catholic school till 8th grade in a small town in the Midwest. It was amazing. The snowy winters of Christmas where magical and people where super nice and I loved my childhood. In high school I started to drift away from the religious scene and was lazy to go to church. Went abroad to study pharmacy and that was when I realized that science and religion are 2 very different paths. My views started to change.\n\nLater returned back to the US and this time to the Sacramento/Bay Area in Cali. Started going to church in Sacramento because parents insisted so I went and people where generally rude and they were not nice. Nothing like what I experienced in a small town in the Midwest. These people where absolute monsters even tho they went to church and identified as Christians. Even the priests where foul people. \n\nSo I looked deeper into spirituality and religions and I developed a updated mindset torward religion and just want to know if there is technically anything wrong with it:\n\nSo I feel being atheist may not suit me because as humans we don't know everything and a lot of Christians use the argument, well you cannot prove there isn't a god. Well while you shouldn't believe in superstition you cannot prove that a higher power of some kind doesn't exist. So I think the best view toward religion would be agnostic as opposed to atheist.\n\nWe as humans are the result of math and science. Luck doesn't exist in the universe, however math and science does exist.\n\nBut as humans we face the burden of not knowing everything. The more you learn about the world the more you realize that there is SO SO much you don't know. We as humans probably only have scratched the surface. Despite the confidence we have developed there still is a lot we do not know. And I feel religion sort of fills this void. In a universe where you cannot know everything you can only HOPE that there is something out there that can advance our desires and best interests. And I feel religion is sort of a way we as humans identtify with a higher power. We are basically saying \"hey higher power we cannot begin to decipher or comprehend your power but this is what we want as human beings and this is how we interpret you through our eyes. So we pray that IF you do exist that you will help us bridge the gap to the unknown. \n\nReligion sort of addresses what we don't fully understand and is a vessel of hope just so people can find maybe a little more strength. Then each religion identifies the super power in a different light so there you can different religion of the world.\n\nBut perhaps religion slowly started becoming about control and believing the superstition exactly as how we perceived God. This is I think where the delusional mindset comes in. This is no longer about having insurance about the unknown and essentially playing the lottery and promoting morality but instead now members of your religious party now punish you for believing exactly how the scripture was written. Then you see religious extremism between religions and then you even see molestation of people by priest?? Like how does that even happen.\n\n\nSo being agnostic I'm not ruling out there isn't a God but you won't see me blindly believing something that doesn't have empirical proof. But go to church you know just in case.\n\nI also identify as a Christian to most people in fear of being disowned by my family and all the people my parents associate with. The time I do spend in church once a week is me just meditating and not really applying a face to God or follow the rules of the church but to just hope that maybe there is a chance something is out there and just for insurance dedicate some time of my life exploring the possibility of the unknown. But at the same time not living my life waiting for God to help me.\n\nWe as humans can understand the intellectual capacity of a dog. A dog cannot understand like we do what space is. His mind is a organic matter that has a limitations of understanding. But we as humans are similar to the fact we too have minds that are organic matters. Just because we are the smartest living organism we have ever encountered in this universe doesn't mean that our organic matter brain doesn't have a intellectual capacity sort of like how we see a dog understands the world. There is a limitation in terms of what we can understand and there is a very real possibility that there are concepts of the universe that are beyond our capacity as humans to understand. It's like trying to teach a fish astronomy. \n\nBut I do believe our subconscious mind does infact understand our limitations and maybe places fear in us that what we don't understand could be potentially harmful to us and maybe religion basically sets us up to perhaps give us a chance of conquering the unknown. It's how we as humans address the problem to the best of our abilities. HOPE.\n\nIt may not be about following a practice exactly how a priests tell you because there are contradictions between what a priest tells you and science. I feel religions strips people of there ability to doubt something or go with there gut and punishes them for even questioning the creator. But God gives you everything but he does not give you peace of mind in trying to use logic as a form of reasoning. Surely he can forgive you for that. \n\nSo when I sit in church for 30mins a week I don't think about how the immaculate conception of Mary shames women for promiscuity and labels them not \"Pure\" when our biological purpose as humans is to reproduce. Instead I try to think of a higher power that I cannot identify with a face and maybe try to talk to it because he MIGHT be listening no guarantees. And ask him for equality among people and help solve world problems and help every person heal and achieve prosperity. While understanding that may never happen and make it a more \"just in case insurance type thing. \n\nThen after 30mins leave church and go outside and live my life logically with a scientific mindset while understanding reproduction is vital for our species to survive.",

  "selftext": "**Note**: This is directed primarily to theists who believe in a version of God that is an absolute standard of perfection. Theists who don't believe in this version of God are welcome to chime in, but I'd like to give those who do a chance to speak first. Obviously, this is going to be of most relevance to monotheistic traditions such as the Abrahamic ones, but if your polytheistic religion has an absolute standard of perfection at the top, I welcome your input as well.\n\nAnd atheists, please **don't make a top-level comment**, unless it's in the form of a devil's advocate-style attempt to poke holes in my argument. I'd like to give theists the first stab at this.\n---\n---\nThe main arguments for a perfect deity establishes a sort of hierarchy of entities, all tracing ultimately back to God. It goes something like this (specifics may differ, this isn't intended to be a complete representation):\n\n* **God** -- The perfect creator of everything\n* **The plan** -- The perfect actualization of God's perfect will\n* **Creation**  -- The perfect actualization of God's perfect plan (includes Heaven, the universe, and any other realm God created)\n* **Universe** -- The perfect manifestation of logical reality in God's perfect creation  \n* **Earth** --The perfect world for God's purposes in the perfect universe  \n* **Life** -- The perfect expression of God's love and will made real on God's perfect world  \n* **Humanity** -- The *imperfect*, sinful, corrupt, and fallen expression of God's ultimate failure\n\nOne of these things is not like the others. At each level, the perfection of the parent entity seems to entail the perfection of the child entity. How could God possibly fail to create a perfect plan? After all, if it *wasn't* perfect, it would mean God failed, and he can't fail *by definition*. So the plan must be perfect. And by the same reasoning, Creation must be perfect, the universe must be perfect, and so on down the line.\n\nAnd yet a central tenet of many religious belief systems is that humanity is not perfect. In some cases, humanity is considered downright broken. How is this possible? If we were created perfectly, then our wills would be perfect, and we would always, of our own volition, choose not to sin. For us to fall in the first place would mean we weren't created perfectly -- more specifically, we weren't created with the will to resist all temptation to sin.\n\nI propose that the disconnect between the perfection of God and all he's done, and the imperfection of humanity, is a gap that cannot logically be bridged. God's perfection entails further perfection. If it fails to generate it, then something is wrong, in much the same way that if a long math problem produces inconsistent results, there's been a misstep along the way and the foundations of the problem are faulty.\n\nPotential objections\n---\n---\n\n1. **Our imperfection is a result of free will**:  \nThe objection is that as agents of our own fates, we engineered our own imperfection, rather than being created imperfectly.  \n**Response**:  \nThis just moves the problem down a step. If there was ever a single instance in which we were perfect -- perfect minds, perfect bodies, and most importantly, perfect *wills* -- then we had the will that would have been necessary and sufficient to resist all temptation to sin. There wouldn't even be such a thing as temptation. The idea of doing the wrong thing would never even occur to us. Our wills, being perfect, would align perfectly with God's.\n2. **Our imperfection is a result of indeterminacy**:  \nThe objection is that our decisions are not determined by the previous states of matter, the universe, or all of creation.  \n**Response**:  \nThis creates two new problems. If our decisions are not determined by matter, the universe, or all of creation, they are either:  \n**a)** Determined by ourselves (as libertarian free will-possessing souls), in which case we're back to the first objection; or  \n**b)** *Not* determined by ourselves, which leaves where decisions to sin come from a mystery, since they don't appear to be a part of God's creation. In addition, this opens up a whole other arena of issues related to the existence of forces that weren't created by God.\n3. **Our imperfection is actually part of the plan, and is therefore not really imperfection**:  \nThe objection is that whatever imperfection we perceive in ourselves is illusory, and actually it's all part of God's perfect plan.  \n**Response**:  \nNot only does this negate free will, it means that we are programmed to sin by God, intentionally. And it renders the concept of sin itself meaningless. We are sin-free after all, because every single thing we do was specifically chosen for us to do by God. While this actually does solve the problem of bridging the gap between perfection and imperfection, it does so by making us the automatons of a mechanistic universe following a program we're designed not to understand. This causes so many other theological problems, it seems like an impossibly bitter pill to swallow in order to salvage the concept of perfection.\n\n---\n\nThoughts?",

  "selftext": "This is one of my favorite mind fucks for Christians.\n\nSo, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, the day and night cycle, threw in some flora and fauna, then finished off with a little human man named Adam. Adam was made in God's image and, therefor, is the main character of Earth.\n\nAdam was enjoying his new existence, but he quickly became lonely. So he asked God for a companion. God obliged, took one of Adam's ribs, and fashioned it into a lady friend for Adam and named her Eve.\n\nAdam and Eve went on frolicking through the Garden of Eden, naked from head to toe and unashamed of it. God came along and said, \"Everything you would ever want can be found here in the garden. Take whatever you want. Nothing is off limits. Oh, except one. You see that tree over there? The one with the bright red tasty-looking thingies hanging from its branches? Yeah, don't eat any of its fruit. At all. Ever. If you do, you will die. And being dead is way worse than being alive. Do you understand?\"\n\nAdam and Eve agreed to God's rule, and soon after, God leaves to conduct some other omnipotent business elsewhere.\n\nThen, along comes a serpent, slithering right up next to Adam. He says, \"Hello, man, what another beautiful day in paradise. Got everything you need? I can't help but notice you haven't tried any fruit from that tree over there.\"\n\n\"Oh, God says we can't have any of those fruit.\" Says Adam.\n\n\"Not even a nibble? It looks delicious.\"\n\n\"No, God said 'no,' so I won't touch it.\"\n\nFeeling a little defeated, the serpent notices Eve and tries again.\n\n\"Good day, woman, look at that nice red fruit on that tree there. Doesn't it just scream flavor and delic-\"\n\n\"Oh, wow, you're right,\" exclaims Eve, \"they do look good! You've convinced me, I'm eating one!\"\n\nEve approaches the tree, plucks an apple from a low-hanging branch, and takes a bite. Her mouth dances with sweet flavor and juice. It's the most delicious thing she's eaten since her creation a few hours earlier.\n\nShe calls Adam over, and among his protests, she shoves the apple into Adam's mouth. He bites, chews, and his eyes widen in delight.\n\nThen, all too suddenly, the humans become painfully aware that they're extremely naked, even though the alternative of being clothed hadn't even been conceived at this point on account of clothes not being a thing, and they became very ashamed of their exposure. So, they grabbed the nearest fig leaves and slapped them on their naughty bits.\n\nThen, God returned from... wherever to check in on his new favorite creations and immediately noticed the leaves. Then he sees the half-eaten apple and he realizes what they had done. He was furious.\n\n\"ONE RULE! I GAVE YOU ONE RULE, AND YOU IMMEDIATELY BROKE IT. THAT'S IT, GET OUT! GET OUT OF MY GARDEN AND NEVER COME BACK! (But I still love youuuuu!) OUT! GIT!\"\n\nSo Adam and Eve left the garden and went to live in squalor.\n\n---‐------------\n\nSo there are three issues with this story: God, the serpent, and the apple.\n\n1. GOD\n\nGod is said to be omniscient and omnipresent. He knows all and sees all. So why is it that God was not around to see Eve give into the serpent's temptation and eat the apple? What was it that took all of his attention away from the only two humans on the planet? Is it even possible for God to stop observing a specific area for a specific amount of time? By all claims of his character, God would have had to have been there at the time because he is everywhere always. So that would mean he knew what was happening but actively chose not to step in.\n\n2. THE SERPENT\n\nNow, nothing outright says this, but the serpent is thought to be the devil in disguise. He's come along to sabotage God's work. But who is the devil? The devil is Lucifer, a fallen angel. God created man and told his angels they must love humans more than they love God, but Lucifer refused to do so, saying they weren't more important than God. So God cast Lucifer from Heaven and sebt him to Hell. But Lucifer wasn't exactly a prisoner in Hell. Many times through the Bible, we see Satan in many forms trying to steer people astray from the ways of God so that he could drag their souls into Hell to be tortured and tormented by him for eternity. So he clearly had the freedom to travel between Hell and the mortal world as he pleased, AND he was tasked with being the overlord of the pits of Hell, punishing the damned souls. But why would God give Lucifer this charge *before* the original sin had been committed? Unless God knew humans would sin to begin with. So he preemptively created the job of soul torturer before any souls had been damned to be tortured.\n\n3. THE APPLE\n\nThis one really takes the cake. The apple grew on the Tree of Knowledge and contained the concept of self-awareness, as well as good and evil. God created man without these traits or knowledge-base as an original design. So if he didn't want man to have this knowledge, why would he put that knowledge in an apple? Why not put it in an inedible object, like a rock? Why put the tree in the Garden of Eden? Why not on the top of a mountain, or in the depths of the ocean, or deep in the lowest chambers of a cave? Or better yet, completely on the opposite side of the Earth? Or even better than that, why have it in a tangible object on Earth at all? Why not throw it in a vessel and keep it safely sitting on a shelf in God's heavenly office?\n\nBy putting the apple within reach of Adam and Eve, as well as specifically pointing it out, God created the temptation. To push them further, God's fallen angel Lucifer moved in to encourage them to give into the temptation so that he could claim their souls for eternal torture in Hell, a job given to him by God. And while all of this was happening, God sat back and watched the whole thing go down, as he is everywhere, always.\n\nTherefor, God set Adam and Eve, and ultimately all of humanity, up for failure right from the get-go. He set the stage, arranged the punishment beforehand, and watched like a player who just removed the ladder from their Sims swimming pool.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

The stress of this gets to him over time and at one point he writes a suicide note to his wife and goes to a window in a tall building but at the last minute backs down. \n\n[Here is Ed Raby's story on Harmonic Atheist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lc_by5wx3Tg).\n\nHe grew up in Assemblies of God, and was educated as a theologian and was a Bible school teacher and pastor.  At some point, he realized it was all bullshit but had to keep being a pastor in order to the keep the peace in his family and because he had nowhere else to go outside of being a pastor.   He tells that the stress of this period was so high that he has no memory of most of it, he makes an analogy of his brain being an overloaded electrical circuit. He has had years of therapy to recover. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt is happenstance that these two guys came to my attention in this way in close proximity in time. \n\nThere are a few elements to this:\n\n* Raised in a strong controlling worldview with theological underpinnings \n* The theological assertions of said worldview conflict with reality\n* The individual at some point recognizes that this stuff is not true\n* The social group is conditioned by the worldview to push out or punish people who make this realization. \n* This extends to family members and other critical social networks\n* Leading individuals who figure out the bullshit to be stuck in a very dangerous cognitive state\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nMany people recovering from religion have problems and traumas they have to address during recovery, but these two examples really highlight the danger of something as simple as beliefs that happen to be false. \n\nNow the reason it is important to acknowledge this is that \"freedom of belief\" is waved around copiously as part of defending religious organizations and practice. \n\nNo, I am not going to try and govern the beliefs inside your head, but yes, I am going to point out that there are beliefs that can be very dangerous, and in complex ways that interact with one's environment.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nA corollary here is that the practice of shunning or punishing people who question or disbelieve the theology of a group is incredibly damaging.  The current case in Norway against JWs is trying to address that.    There was also a prior one in Belgium that ended up overturned. \n\nThe US is a mess around regulating religious groups, but I going to say no tax exemption for any religious group or organization that does this.

This leads me back to sentimental types. Being stupid allows people to use their emotions to make judgements for them, on a monumental scale. Some sentiment and emotion is good for having empathy for instance, but when someone ozzes sentiment all over they don't exercise judgement properly. People like this can end up being passive aggressive all while looking nice on the surface, because they don't bother thinking through their hypocrisies.

I'm not surprised that every theist I've met thinks mostly with their gut.\n\nFurthermore, when society allows sentimental, folksy thinking to be the norm, then it doesn't surprise me that half of everyone gives trump a pass possibly because they connect with his moments of incoherent folksy showmanship.\n\nLastly, this was a rant, yes, but don't tell me being judgmental is always wrong.",

Recently my younger sibling let us know that they will be converting to Islam. I was shocked, mostly cause their beliefs and lifestyle don't resonate with religion, specially Islam, at all. They are a good person and all that, but they definitely don't have traditional views on life.\n\nAfter we had a conversation, I concluded the main motivation is fear of death and going to hell. They literally told me: I have more to lose if I don't believe, than if I do. So I think this sudden change is fabricated. They are convincing me it's not, and that they've always been a Muslim deep down and some bs. So now they are gonna start praying, dressing more modestly, fasting and some minor changes. I asked what about sex, and they answered that all sins are forgiven since before they consciously became Muslim. And that the biggest sin is not to believe, bigger than sex, so they should be fine. I support them if that's what's gonna help their mental health honestly, I just want them to be happy, but it feels like they're a different person now. We used to joke about religious people and now they are one of them. I just feel lost on how to act from now on.\n\nI spoke about it to my partner, who is a Christian. We spoke about motivation for doing good deeds, sin, God's will etc. I said I just can't understand how it's fine to sin, pretty much everything is a sin for that matter, and you just repent and pray and it's fine? Like how is it worse to not believe in God but be a good person, than to believe and sin all the time and in the end its all forgiven and you get to go to heaven just for believing? My partner doesn't have an answer to that, of course, and they are also living in sin and unable to even talk to the priest about it (divorced, but it wasn't cleared by the church of course, and now were dating). They are kinda pissed they should be alone for the rest of their lives apparently to adhere to their religion, just cause their ex partner wanted to divorce them. They agree a lot of that is bs, and it hurts them, but even then, they still believe in God and in Christianity. \n\nHonestly, I'm just so mad. I love both of them so much and this religion talk is all I can think about lately, and it's really frustrating.

They are just a bio-mechanism that reacts to the world that surrounds it. A mere mashine made out of flesh.\n\nFurther, what we call empathy, and what may have been useful for primates in the past, has lost its function as of today. Back in the day they lived in tribes in order to withstand attacks from natural enemies. Also, they weren't able to create a stable supply of necessary ressources individually, so they were dependent on collaborating with others in order to survive. Again they didn't do this out of sympathy, but out of an opportunistic mindset or better said in order to ensure their own survival, out of a greedy desire to stay alive, out of fear to die. \n\nWe, as beings that emerged from the animal kingdom and are still animalistic in nature are in all our actions driven by the greedy desire of our passionate drives. Which means that all our non violent interactions function according to the principle of bartering and all our violent interactions function according to the princple of robbery.\n\nWith technological advancement, the necessity to live in tribes vanished, and each individual was able to provide for themselves due to technology. \n\nSo \"empathy\" or better said the non-violent barter interaction with other tribe members weren't necessary anymore. \n\nWhat is left then? The violent way of interacting: robbery. If you get in a position of power, where you decide what get's done and produced with machines then you will eventually rule over the population. \n\nAnd you might even find great pleasure in that power, because isn't the drive to eat and and the drive to procreate a will to power of sorts?

They are going to die anyway, so you better utilize the opportunity to your advantage. If you can get sadistic satisfaction out of the suffering of other living beings, why not do what is necessary to satisfy that sadistic desire within you? After all, you are an animal, and your function and purpose is to embrace your passionate drives, because that is your nature and you can't transcend that, you were born this way, you are predetermined by your biological body to be this way and eventually die this way.\n\nAlso, if you choose to not engage in violent interactions, your counterpart will and you will eventually become their slave. Either way natural selection takes place in this war of all against all scenario. \n\nAnd that's only natural, because this way a new species can emerge, the Transhumanist. This is how the animal kingdom has been, how it is, and how it will be in the future.

If god is all-knowing that would mean he already knows my relative has cancer. If he's all-good why would we have to ask him to cure him? He would just do it. Christians say god is a heavenly father that loves us as his earthly children. If anybody had the ability to cure their child of a disease and prevent them from suffering, would that child have to *ask* for it before the parent does it? And ask multiple times on top of that? Or would the parent just do it? Or better yet, if that parent is all-powerful and all-knowing then the parent already knew they were going to get cancer before they got it and could have prevented it in the first place. But not only that you still have to go through chemo and radiation because apparently the prayer alone won't do the job. Christians tell me god relies on doctors to do his healing work through. \n\nIt then just sort of struck me why religious people say they'll pray for sick ones. Most people have a hard time coping with the fact that we live in a world where random bad things could happen to anyone at any minute. Good people can get cancer and die at a young age. It seems very unfair. People can't deal with the fact that so much of life is out of their control. Prayer just makes people feel like they have some agency over things in their life. It makes them feel in control, like there's something we can actually do. Prayer is primarily about the psychological comfort for the person praying. It makes them feel like they are doing something useful rather than sitting on the sidelines watching fate unravel in a cold and indifferent universe. Even if I believed in a god, I would not pray, because I see absolutely no point in it. If there is a god, it does not involve itself in this universe and does not respond to prayers or grant favors to anyone. We're on our own.",

The early struggles with atheism are based on not realizing things true about our universe.\n\nI used this as an opportunity to go through my old favorites but some haven't aged well, others aren't easy to digest for noobs, and rediscovered the glory of NonStampCollector. Take this opportunity to share some of your new or old favorite videos. And anything with quick easy examples of evolution\n\nAdditionally, I am searching for a specific piece of what could be considered \"atheist lost media.\" It delves into the \"Legendary\" aspect, an extension of C.S. Lewis's famous \"Lord, Liar, Lunatic\" trilemma, presenting how the narratives of the four Gospels have evolved and diverged over time through their various authors.\n\nI want to remind ourselves that we should be out doing this thing to *add* to people's lives, rather than take away faith and meaning. It's about enriching our understanding and appreciation of the world by affirming our commitment to fostering curiosity, critical thinking, and a sense of community among those navigating one step closer to unraveling our place in the universe.",

  "selftext": "Hey all. I can't believe this seems to be happening again.  Several years ago, I developed a friendship with a neighbor.  She was xtian but definitely a questioning one who was greatly influenced by her fundamentalist Baptist adult daughter. We used to have civil discussions and both knew when to stop.  After a couple years her daughter managed to convince her mother that I was a bad influence.  Add that to fact they were both staunch trumpies, relationship ended badly.  Fast forward a few years. \nI got to know someone through exercise class. We started hanging out every couple weeks or so, especially in summer sitting on her deck. She was a church goer before pandemic but after,  decided to switch churches from united to some non denominational new church who she admits, preaches anti gay sermons, is anti abortion etc.. My friend doesn't like that part, is accepting of same sex relationships and is pro choice, but still attends the  churchand thinks its great.  Recently she sent me a message , and felt it necessary to tell me about a decision she had made ( that didn't involve me), but had to include \" I prayed over it and feel God wanted me to....\"\nI responded to message and added I would appreciate if she left god/praying out of messages to me. I also noticed her fb posts have suddenly become very preachy. She responded saying she'd agree, if I didn't wear my atheist top while sitting on her deck! I had it specially made last year, showed her, she didn't object at all. It's very tasteful with a bouquet of flowers with words \" friendly neighborhood atheist \". I had it made just to show people that there are cool, nice atheists, despite what churches preach. I certainly don't push it or bring it up. I'm shocked and am thinking maybe religion has once again ended a friendship.  Horrible timing as I'm just coming to terms with my lonely life.

  "selftext": "Edit: thanks peeps, I knew I had the right crowd. I'll just go back to being an unlabeled godless peasant. \n\nTLDR, I'm not sure I see any real differences between atheism and agnosticism. Please clarify without just throwing the definitions at me. Something more relatable. \n\nI'm not the type of person to care about labels, I really just live my life and others can live theirs the way they want. Today my wife had to fill out an assement for one of her nursing classes and it asked about her religious status. We have always just said we are atheists, but to be honest it's purely from our lack of belief. We were raised Catholic but left that far behind us. She looked up the religious definitions for a closer look.\n\nTheism: belief in the existence of a god or gods, especially belief in one god as creator of the universe, intervening in it and sustaining a personal relation to his creatures.\n\nAtheism: a. : a lack of belief or a strong disbelief in the existence of a god or any gods. b. : a philosophical or religious position characterized by disbelief in the existence of a god or any gods.\n\nAgnostic: a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God.\n\nWith these mentioned, she decided to put agnostic in the class assessment, and really I don't care what it says, but this just got my brain stirring. When I say I'm an atheist, it sounds silly to me when people talk about their magic person in the sky, but I'm open to whatever they want to believe, I just don't believe it myself. If they cross the boundary and start trying to indoctrinate or proselytize me, I start to take issue.\n\nThis being said, I talked with CharGPT4 for a while about the topic and still really don't see any major differences between atheism and agnosticism. Obviously someone who is an Atheist and someone who is a Theist can blend into the blurred line that is agnosticism, but ChatGPT told me I likely fall under agnostic atheism. As an \"Atheist\" I don't go around shouting that God isn't real, it's more of, \"I don't believe in things pertaining to higher power without firm evidence\" or as Carl Sagan says “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence”. But even he said he isn't sure about what's out there and he's comfortable with the unknown. Just because something isn't known doesn't give anyone permission to insert whatever they want. \n\nYou all get this, so I'll try to get to the point. Why do I have such a hard time seeing the difference in agnosticism and atheism? I don't care about titles or words to describe what I just consider a default mode prior to indoctrination. Yet this still has me 2nd guessing my understanding of these words. I'm just content to be alive and thats all, I stopped making claims that god doesn't exist only because of the friction and to be honest I can't prove non-existence. My wife also doesn't believe in a higher power but remains in the mindset that she can't say they do or do not exist so she's ok just not believing and not knowing, so she aligned with Agnostic for her worksheet.",

The application of science to human affairs can only lead to hell. This world is largely run by the Devil. ‘The shadow of the dark wing is over all Tellus,’ and the best we can do is to work out our own salvation in fear and trembling. Revealed religion tells us how to do this. Any human attempts at a planned world are merely playing into the hands of the Devil. Auld Hornie, by the way, to use the pet name which the Scots have given him, perhaps in thanks for his attacks on the Sabbath, has been in charge of our planet since before life originated on it. He even had a swipe at Mars, and removed much of its atmosphere. Some time in the future Jesus and the good angels will take our planet over from him. Meanwhile the Church is a resistance movement, but liberation must await a celestial D-Day. The destruction of Messrs.

The show does a great job at pointing out the hypocrisy in religion especially episode 6 which basically has religious trauma the song. Anyway if anyone saw it what did you think",

  "selftext": "I have been a lurker here for some time now. I have also interacted with various Christian internet communities of all sorts, evangelical Protestants, Catholics, etc. Over the years, I’ve made several observations. \n\nIn Christian internet communities, they often refer to “reddit tier atheism”, of course referring to this board in particular, to denote arguments by atheists that lack philosophical and theological rigor. **Even as an atheist myself**, I have to come to recognize the validity of this designation. \n\nFor example, many atheists love to use obviously legendary Old Testament stories, such as Exodus or the great flood, to attempt to denigrate the validity of the Christian message as a whole. However, such criticisms leave Christianity relatively unscathed, so long as the hypothetical Christian is not a biblical literalist. A Christian can agree that Old Testament stories are legendary and did not happen literally as they are described, and still cogently remain a Christian. So while this pokes holes, it pokes holes in a ship Christian’s don’t have to sail in, so to speak. \n\nWhy people enter and remain in the faith is also often misunderstood. Faith is comforting. Without faith, questions of our purpose, origin, right and wrong, good and bad, become far less certain and more complicated. This can be scary and disorienting for a religious person, and they may remain in their faith even if they have reasonable doubts, simply because they feel safer and more secure on the side they are currently on. Faith, in most instances, is emotional, not logical. I will add that this is not necessarily a bad thing. Emotions have a legitimate role in shaping how we view the world and our place in it. There is undoubtedly an emotional component to atheism as well.\n\nAnswering these big questions loaded with emotional baggage is an area in which atheists had dismal performances. Often, blatant, Rick-and-Morty-tier nihilism, and other meme philosophies, accompany casual atheism. This is not only harmful to the appeal of atheism generally, but it also is not even a necessary consequence of the position. There is a plethora of secular philosophical work that seeks to answer these big questions in a naturalistic way. But hardly, if ever, are these views discussed or advocated for in atheist communities. \n\nThis is simply a hallmark of internet communities such as these. Preaching to the choir, seeking social and intellectual validation at the expense of a religion very few (even those in the very religion!) understand. If I may offer unsolicited advice, take a deep dive into Christian history, philosophy, and theology. Learn about the different denominations, heresies, views on the trinity, views on the Bible, etc. Know more about the faith than the theist in front of you. Perhaps go wider, look into other sources such as the Vedic scriptures. Dive into secular philosophical literature so that you have something positive to contribute over the purely negative act of solely attacking religion.  \n\nOf course, nobody has to do that. But in my view, it makes me question why they would take up this fight. The only possible answer I can think of is that it is simply pleasurable to take a persons world view and smash it to pieces. At that point, this is no longer a matter of truth, or of morality and right and wrong, but a narcissistic need to put others down to raise themselves up. It is sophistry, a means to demonstrate rhetorical prowess, not have constructive conversations. Such a dichotomous approach renders meaningful discouse and learning nearly impossible.",

  "selftext": "**Hi. This is an explaination to my recent post that got quite the attention**  \n**LINK:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1alt0v7/a\\_new\\_islamic\\_highschool\\_is\\_opening\\_in\\_my\\_country/](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1alt0v7/a_new_islamic_highschool_is_opening_in_my_country/)  \n\n\nSummary of the post: Islamic school is opening near me, I named some rules they have and called them out for their bullshit  \n\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is an extremely long post. like. rlly long. sorry. But I want to totally explain myself and my thoughts beacuse that's what this atheist forum is made for.  \n\n\nHowever, I am sorry for not explaining further. That is on me. I got comments from both religious and atheist people that my post was bad because of this, I'm very glad you guys have let me known this, so here I am to explain a few things.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **So you like to shit on Islamic schools and not on X religious schools?**   \nSome of you REALLY like to cherrypick... I get this is the r/atheism subreddit, but not every post has to include ALL religions. As far as I am aware. I was just talking about this **one** specific school. The reason I wanted to talk about that one, Islamic one, specifically, is because it is near where I live.  \nNo. I don't despise Islam more Christianity. but Islam is causing more problems in my area (that I am seeing) than Christianity is. I don't think some people understand that. Atheism is different all around the world.  \nThe reason I do not speak about Christianity is because I have not seen the effects of Christianity. I live in the Netherlands and where I live in the country this is not such a big problem. It def is one, but I can choose what I want to speak about. I hope this answers your question.  \n**Also no, I am not racist.** You guys REALLY love to call people racist on the internet for no reason.  \nI am Persian. My parents are both from Iran. I have and am experiencing discrimination/racism in my life. I understand how Muslims feel when they get discriminated against, especially girls who wear Hijab (by choice or not doesn't matter)  \nDiscrimination because of Hijabi is NOT okay. Muslims are people just like us, they are not dumb, there are SOO many wonderful and smart Muslims around the world. But this is r/atheism this is a place where we highlight the bad stuff because it is **dangerous.I**  \nI am NOT against immigration..  \nbecause of immigration, I got a chance to be in this country, this country with equality between men and women, equal education, something that a lot of other countries do not give me, including where my parents are from.   \nI am not against muslims being in the Netherlands, Like I said, they are still people that we should respect. I am 100% positive about culture mixing!! It's so fun to learn about each other, but there are bad effects of this!! Which is what I wanted to talk about.  \n\n2. **Why do you care so much? You do you thing, let them do their thing.**  \nTHIS is where my main problem is.  \nOk look, Islam isn't a culture, I am aware of that. But there is CERTAINLY a culture AROUND Islam (and also other religions!) **For this section I am taking the general beliefs of every group, I know there are muslims that are open to for exmp. LGBT. And I know there are ENOUGH Dutch people who are LGBTphobic**  \nOf the most important differences may be the contrast between some conservative interpretations of religious doctrines, which promotes strict gender roles and modesty, (gave an exmaple of this in the last post) and the relatively liberal and egalitarian values present in Dutch culture. Dutch society is known for its emphasis on gender equality, LGBT rights, and a generally progressive approach to social issues...  \n(But even then, Dutch culture is REALLY diverse, there are enough sexist and homophobic dutchies, I feel like I have to repeat this every once in a while)  \nNow, I am not saying dutch culture is superior, no culture is BETTER than the other, no person or race is BETTER than the other, but I am only saying that Dutch culture and culture around Islam are **REALLY DIFFERENT!!!!!!!!**  \nYou can ask ex-muslims who went to a Islamic school. Multiple people online are sharing their experiences, multiple of my friends went to an Islamic school, this is where I am getting a lot (not all) of my information from:  \n**I am not saying, that they straight up teach these kids to KILL non-muslims or LGBT people.** I really do not think they do that. Islam is NOT terrorism, Muslims are not TERRORISTS, Islam is NOT Taliban. Islam can be a great thing.  \nHowever, we can all agree that Islamic (maybe other religions too?) schools do not promote LGBT in a positive way. They either promote it in a negative way, or kids get it negatively promoted by their parents.  \n**\"DONT TEACH KIDS ABOUT LGBT!!! LET PARENTS CHOOSE WHAT THEIR KIDS BELIEVE!!!!\"**  \nI fully agree! Schools should not push kids to (not) believe in stuff.  \nBut heavily (not) promoting something is BAD.  \nWhy can't they be like \"This is LGBT, we do not believe this is allowed in our religion, however, there are people that are not within our religion because we live in a diverse country. It is important that we are kind to one another, even if they do not have the same beliefs as us\" Is it really that hard? Just say Islam doesn't allow LGBT, but others can be LGBT if they want to and we shouldn't show hatred. Is that bad?  \n*\"Okay why do u want them to be neutral about LGBT and atheists?\"*   \nValid question; **because they will then be send off to university/work where they will be mixed with people that are not muslim and do not share the same beliefs.**  \n\"*Why is this bad?\"* **Because it will create misunderstandings between each other.**   \nImagine you are a religious person in the Netherlands. Your WHOLLLEEE life you've been surrounded by girls being covered from head to toe, LGBT is not acceptable, women are less than men, etc...  \nThen suddenly. POP! You graduate from highschool, you enter the world.  \nThere's girls wearing croptops, short jeans, open talk about abortion, people are very openly LGBT, there's women with a lot of power.. etc...  \nMust be very confusing for you right? And I don't blame you. I can imagine it's frustating to suddenly see them go against the rules you were taught were THE rules.   \n\n\nSame goes for atheists too. Don't be racist guys, don't show violence against other people.  \nIf you are an Atheist and is mean to EVERY religious person you see, fuck you. You are an asshole.  \nWe should learn about different cultures and religions in schools, it is important to know that the world is very diverse, we could learn from each other! I think that is really good for understanding one another! That's why religious schools need to go and everyone should just be mixed in ONE place.",

  "selftext": "I’ve personally left the most popular ex muslim page because more often, I found myself having to correct what felt like almost everyone on that damn page on why LGBTQ and women’s rights aren’t up for discussion in a secular nation. The reason I left Islam was because of how barbaric and backwards it was on the topic of LGBTQ, women’s rights and a whole Parking lot of things. So I felt astonished that a page meant for people that left the faith was not monitoring theologically similar dog poop unfounded ideas being spewed with practically no pushback. \n\nI feel like in a couple of years, if this trend of hating muslims and praising Christianity on these pages that were initially meant for people that left Islam continues, it becomes a far right circle jerk. \n\nJust being an ex Muslim isn’t enough to me, atleast anymore. Personally anyone that left Islam and became a Christian to me or vice versa 99% chance they still hold anti women sentiments, anti LGBTQ sentiments and largely vote for far right extremists politicians in the west. \n\nPersonally I wish critical thinking would be put into some of these folks decisions. Mind you, I’m not speaking on ex muslims in places outside the west but inside the west, the vast majority do think critically about leaving. It’s just baffling to me that Christians make the same arguments against ex Christians “ooh you were never a true christian” no true Scottsman “you were never a true Muslim” \n\nJust makes me sad that so many vulnerable ex muslims think they can go to a safe space but instead are met with the same ideas that are on the other side of the same coin. \n\nLet me know what you think",

  "title": "Just a fun little story on how naive and short-sighted some religious people can be sometimes.",
  "selftext": "I've been putting off on posting this for a while now but I just need to share it because I find the irony of the entire situation very funny. You probably won't find it that funny but I just need to get it off my chest.\n\nFirstly, I need to give some context for the story to make sense. I'm a Mechanical Engineering student currently in my third year. It's been a bit rough, especially last year. I was struggling with severe depression and ended up stopping my studies for the second semester last year. \n\nI also grew up in a Christian Household. Where I'm from, the majority of people are religious so it's kind of the norm. It's also worth mentioning that it started going better when I finally decided that I'm not going to pretend to be the person everyone expects me to be. Meaning when I finally decided that I don't believe and that I'm going to stop trying to believe.\n\nSeeing as I stopped my studies, I had to get a job of some sort for the 6-ish months that I wasn't going to be at uni. I ended up at a fairly small scale engineering shop. Near the end of last year, probably a few days or weeks before I was going to leave, my boss came up to me and tried to give me a sort of pep-talk or something.\n\nThe main points he tried to make was that I shouldn't give in to peer pressure and that I should trust The Lord and believe with all my heart.\n\nFirst off, peer pressure had nothing to do with my depression. I hate following the crowd because I'm different than the majority of people. I don't drink and I don't smoke and I hate being around most people becaise I find it very hard to relate to most people.\n\nAnd now for the funny part. He was telling me to not give in to peer pressure but he was also telling me to believe in The Lord. To me, that is a contradiction seeing as religion is basically just peer pressure. Or at least that's how I've experienced it in my life. Religion has always been this thing that I had to do and not a thing that I want to do if that makes sense? \n\nSo yeah, that's about it. I guess that's a lot of text for a very short story but that's fine I guess. Like I said, I just needed to get this off my chest.",

He was in the hospital for a month, and suffered quite a bit. It was a horrible experience and I miss him very much.

However, recently, we encountered a major disagreement that has left me questioning our entire relationship.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue arose when the topic of abortion came up. I've always been pro-choice, believing in a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. However, my boyfriend is staunchly pro-life and adamantly opposed to abortion. He argued passionately about preserving the life of the unborn child and the sanctity of human life, while I countered that it's ultimately a woman's decision what to do with her body.\r  \n\r  \nThe conversation quickly turned heated, and I ended up feeling incredibly frustrated and hurt. I couldn't believe that someone I care about could hold such views that, in my opinion, are deeply rooted in outdated religious beliefs and infringe upon women's autonomy.\r  \n\r  \nWhat's even more challenging is that this is the first significant disagreement we've ever had in our otherwise wonderful relationship.

I value my autonomy and beliefs deeply, but I also care for my boyfriend and our relationship. Should I try to have a calm and rational conversation with him about this issue and see if we can find common ground, or is it time to accept that our differences are too significant to overcome and move on?\r  \n\r  \nHas anyone else been in a similar situation?

I believe everyone's entitled to believe whatever they want, even if I don't agree with them. I just had a thought that came to me, but I think I need an atheist's perspective because I don't think I can answer it from mine. \n\nIn Islam (and most religions), we believe in the afterlife, where everyone will be Judged based on their deeds in life, where disputes between people will be resolved, and where you'll have a final destination (heaven or hell). That belief is a huge part of what keeps us going in life, no matter how bad it gets. This got me thinking of how someone without that belief does it. How do you convince yourself to keep going? Life is not easy for most of us outside the upper class elites, which is a high percentage of all humans, so what makes it easier for you? Also, how do you deal with the fact that some objectively evil people by all standards will get away with all the bad things they did and the people they've hurt, because they're too powerful to be punished in life and won't be judged after death? \n\nSorry if I offended anyone, I really tried to answer these on my own, but like I said my beliefs and perspective prevent me from doing so.

  "selftext": "As the title says, they've copied pretty much every important aspect to them. I know most people are aware that there are similarities between those religions and others, but I do not believe most know to what extent. I've seen quite a few religion debates and I've never even once seen someone get into just how much they've taken from Zoroastrianism or the Babylonians. That would put any religious person in a pretty hard position to defend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, let's start with Islam, which has a lot of similarities with Christianity as it is supposed to be the continuation of it. Let's first talk about what Mohammed took from the Old Testament specifically and not the New one.\n\nThere's of course not eating pork:\n\nLev 11:7: And the pig is unclean to you, because though the horn of its foot is parted, its food does not come back\n\nDeut. 11:8: \tAnd the pig is unclean to you, because though it has a division in the horn of its foot, its food does not come back; their flesh may not be used for food or their dead bodies touched by you.\n\nHe quite literally and openly copied the punishment for adultery from the Torah [The book of Legal Punishment Chapter 6 of  Stoning Jews and Ahl Adh-Dhimmah for Zina](https://sunnah.com/muslim:1700a).\n\nThere's the command to kill nonbelievers, women wearing a veil, fasting, etc.\n\nThere's not much to say about Islam and Christianity since it is supposedly its continuation, but there are interesting similarities with Zoroastrianism (the oldest monotheistic religion).\n\n* .***Zoroastrians pray 5 times a day :***\n\n(1.Havan Geh - Starts 36 minutes prior to sun-rise and last till 12  \nnoon.                                                                                                                                                                            2. Rapithvan Geh - Starts at 12:33 PM to 3 PM. Second Havan (Biji Havan) that starts from  \nMah Ava Roz Hormuzd starts from 12 noon to 3 PM.                                                                                          3 . Uziren Geh - Starts at 3:33 to sunset.   \n4. Aevishuthrem Geh - Starts 72 minutes after sunset till 12 midnight.   \n5. Ushen Geh: From midnight local time 12:33 to 36 minutes before sunrise. \n\n* In Islam:\n\n   1. Fajr (prayed at dawn)  \n2.Dhuhr (prayed at midday)  \n3.Asr (prayed in the afternoon)  \n4.Maghrib (prayed at sunset)  \n5.Isha (prayed at night)  \n\n\n.***Story of Prophet:***\n\n* Zoroastrianism: Zarathurstra was visited by an angel/divine being who shared with him the intentions of God\n* Islam: Mohammed gets a visit from angel Gabriel who sent him the quran\n\n ***Water purification/ablution***\n\n* Zoroastrianism:\n\nThey first recite a prayer and then clean arms, feet, arms face, etc. and raise their hands in prayer to Ahura Mazda (God). Women can not purify themselves if they are menstruating as blood is impure\n\nIslam:\n\n* (wudu) They first recite a prayer and then clean their arms, face, mouth, forehead, etc. and raise their hands in prayer while reciting the Shahada and Dua. Mentruating women are impure as blood is impure.\n\n***Veiling in prayer:***\n\nZoroastrianism asked women to wear a veil and loose garments during prayer, just like in Islam.\n\n***Names of god:***\n\nZoroastrianism has 101 names for their god. Islam has 99\n\n***Concept of Balance:***\n\n* Zoroastrianism: When you die, you will have each of your bad and good deeds weighed. If you have more bad deeds, you go to hell. Same for Islam.\n\n***Voyage to heaven:***\n\n* In the story Arta Virafs, a saint goes to heaven one night accompanied by an angel just like Mohammed. Zarathustra is also said to have gone to heaven to acquire divine law just like mohammed did. [quick summary since the story is very long](https://www.scribd.com/document/478670712/ZOROASTRIANISM-ARTA-VIRAF-S-NIGHT-JOURNEY)\n\n**Now for Christianity:**\n\n* The story of Noah was copied from the Babylonians by the Jews while they lived under their rule. The story of Gilgamesh is older than the bible by thousands of years.:\n\n   In brief, Utnapishtim had become immortal after building a ship to weather the Great Deluge that destroyed mankind. He brought all of his relatives and all species of creatures aboard the vessel. Utnapishtim released birds to find land, and the ship landed upon a mountain after the flood. The story then ends with tales of Enkidu's visit to the underworld.\n\nFor more specific details as to how they're legit identical see [here](https://www.icr.org/article/noah-flood-gilgamesh/)\n\n***\"An Eye for an Eye\"*** is written word for word in the Hammurabi code (written around 500 years before the Jews came back if I'm not mistaken).\n\n**Human essence**\n\n* Babylonian Mythology: Humans made from clay and blood of a rebellious God (i.e in  God's image)\n* Genesis: Also Clay. Genesis 2:7 \"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul\".  (and  Qur'an 23:12)\n\n**Story of Moses:**\n\n* Babylonian Legend: Sargon's Birth Legend states that he never knew his father. According to this folktale, his mother, an entu (high) priestess, found it necessary to hide her infant. She set the child in a reed basket sealed with bitumen to make it watertight. The basket was placed in a river and floated away\n* Bible: Moses was born in Egypt to Hebrew parents, who set him afloat on the Nile in a reed basket to save him from an edict calling for the death of all newborn Hebrew males.\n\n**Circumcision:**\n\nThe Jews adopted that practice during the times they lived under Egyptian rule, where circumcision was very popular.\n\n**Story of Abraham:**\n\n* Hinduism (older than Judaism):  Brahma was the first created being and is often seen as the father of mankind. Wife of Brahma=Sarasvati\n* Judaism: Abraham is said to be the father of the Jews. Wife of Abraham? Sarah\n\n*Note:*The Jewish scholar Flavius Josephus (37 – 100 AD) quotes from Clearchus's fragment in his Contra Apionem \\[Against Apion\\], which has Aristotle had said: “…These Jews are derived from the Indian philosophers; they are named by the Indians Calani.\n\n* **Greek mythology:** \"Athamas the founder of Thessaly, but also king of the city of Orchomenus in Boeotia (a region of southeastern Greece), took the goddess Nephele as his first wife. They had two children, the boy Phrixus and the girl Helle. Later Athamas became enamored of and married Ino, the daughter of Cadmus. When Nephele left in anger, drought came upon the land. Ino was jealous of her stepchildren and plotted their death.s[ource](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece) \n\nIno bribed messengers to tell the king that in order to end the famine, they must  sacrifice Phrixus  on Mount Lefitian. As Athmas was about to sacrifice his son, Zeus sent a golden-winged ram to rescue the son\n\nTorah/Old Testament: Abraham has a second wife just like Athmas,he is to sacrifice his son of Mount Moriah, and a ram is used instead of a sacrifice\n\n**\"God Given Land\"**\n\n* Greek Mythology: \"Jason, leader of the Argonauts, belonged to the same extended family as Phrixus, all being descended from Aeolus.  \nZeus was angry with the descendants of Aeolus over the attempted sacrifice of Phrixus by his father, and to appease his divine wrath Jason embarked in the Argo with a band of followers (the Argonauts) to retrieve the golden fleece. (This was the fleece of the ram that had saved Phrixus at the last moment from being sacrificed.)  \nTriton, son of the sea god Poseidon, appeared in human form and gave one of the Argonauts, Euphemus, a gift of a handful of Libyan soil as a token of a promise that his descendants would return and colonize the land. Had Euphemus succeeded in keeping the soil to plant appropriately in his own home area, his descendants would have returned to colonize only four generations later. But since the soil was washed overboard and its particles landed on the island of Thera instead, seventeen generations would have to pass and Cyrene would have to be colonized by the descendants of the Argonauts after first settling in Thera.\" [summary from here + more info](https://vridar.org/2011/03/16/argonautica-and-bible/)\n* Torah/Old Testament: \"God commands Moses to lead his people to Canaan by invoking his promise to give it to the fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses at first refuses by pleading that he stutters. If Battus ruled the Argonauts for forty years, Moses (also once called a king and known as a king in Philo), led his people for forty years also\".  \n\n\nThere are a bunch of other similarities, but I think you get the point. I think the enormous amount of stories copied from other religions/cultures should be used more often as evidence against the validity of Abrahamic religions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "31, lifelong atheist, based in UK.   \nWhile we had religious studies in school, and I have a few religious friends, I cannot see theism outside of a type of insanity. In my teens and 20s I was more charitable, called it low existential-intelligence, a crutch for dealing with the pain and unknowable things in life and death, the McDonalds of philosophy etc etc.   \nThese days, an internal 'NO' just arises, not unlike when I detect someone has dark triad traits - I just switch off interest and find myself consciously/unconsciously sliding the person into a category that makes them (I'm sad to admit) not quite equal. More a 'lost cause' type of group. I have to try \\*hard\\* to  compartmentalise when it comes to friends, and that to me feels like softly indulging a lie, or pretending to not know something I do \\*more on compartmentalisation at the end...  \n\n\nWith this 'dehumanising' I know it's unfair, it's un-nuanced, and I'm perhaps missing out of interacting with more people who have some good and interest to them. And yet, I'm really starting to not care, or feel too tired to be bothered with them. If we can't get on the same page with reality, what use is connecting superficially with people? Why tolerate the insane who, with certain dogmas, would easily let me, and people like me, suffer and die for being 'wrong'.   \n\n\n\\* Wherever theists may stand on the spectrum between delusion and compartmentalisation, both are a resistance to reality, and so at the very best a weakness in character, and at worst the foundations for narcissism and psychopathy, especially if indoctrinated and traumatised.   \n\n\nI feel like I'm being an asshole, but not at all an asshole in comparison to those who proselytise, shame, bully, harass, manipulate, honour-kill etc.   \n\n\nI am looking for some reflections on where you stand in this regard, how you (truly/inwardly) see theists.

Whenever people talk about slavery and Christianity, it's always about humans enslaving each other. While the bible never says that masters must set their slaves free, or that slaves should demand their freedom, most Christians would still say that the bible is against slavery. \n\nBut what about when it comes to humans being slaves to God? There is no arguing about this theme. The slave/master relationship is referenced all throughout the bible in verses where we are being encouraged to embrace the role of the slave. I want to learn more about this and get more source material, but most search results that involve God and slavery are talking about human masters. \n\nWhat are your guys thoughts on this subject? Do you have any verses or parables that are particularly useful in showing how the god of the bible dehumanizes us and views us as slaves? ",

Also, the universe itself can always be there in the same way you think god can.

Their 'all-powerful being' definition is also met with evidences against it.\nSuffering of innocents indicate that there's no god. Something conscious and all-powerful can't be this cruel by its own will. And he is evil then he would've made sufferings permanent, which too isn't observed. This proves that he is neither a good guy nor a bad one. If you assume he is something in between then that contradict with 'all-powerful and omniscient being' definition. No way god will create something if he just don't care.\nOnly thing this could mean is that 'universe and life' isn't job of something conscious. We are just a little order in chaos. \n\nIn conclusion, even if there's something whose form is beyond our imagination, it is just 'self-existent', nothing else.",

  "title": "Theists have zero proof of their claims that is convincing to other theists outside of their religious circle.",
  "selftext": "\n**Thesis**\n\nTheists have zero proof of their claims that is convincing to other theists outside of their religious circle. This can range from their supernatural claims (e.g. no gods - Buddhism, one god - Abrahamic, multiple gods - Hinduism), natural claims (e.g. how the universe came about), claims on authority (e.g. Catholic versus Orthodox), claims on what to worship (e.g. Catholic obsession with Mary versus with largely the Protestant ignoring her for venerations). \n\nEven within a religion there can be major differences. Hinduism has four major branches, with dozens of sub-branches that cover the gamut of monotheism to polytheism with different schools and practices as a normal aspect of their religion. Christianity in a similar way supports monotheism - as three aspects (most Christian branches subscribe to this), non-Trinitarian groups (e.g. Unitarians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons).\n\n**Specific Examples**\n\nHow each overall religion deals with these fundamental differences is important since each group will make \n claims that they are true but can't prove. Hinduism accepts that people are allowed to have their own views of how to worship and what to worship and are generally accepting of all beliefs; as such, how other humans worship is more or less understood and accepted, spoiled only by their caste system, which they're trying-hard/not-trying-well to shed.\n\nChristianty, on the other hand, was born of literal blood, from the founding of the crucifixion of its rebellious leader, through the persecution of early Christians, the Christians persecution of pagans and Jews, before turning on each other as they branched and rebranched into Protestantism and ultimately, if that's the right word, Mormonism, which is still seen as a cult. The Catholic Church even went as far as to not recognize Mormon baptisms due to these doctrinal differences, going as far as to formalize it in [THE QUESTION OF THE VALIDITY OF BAPTISM CONFERRED IN\nTHE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER-DAY SAINTS](https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni-ladaria_en.html), signed by (https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010605_battesimo_mormoni_en.html)[John Paul II himself].\n\nIslam, who makes the claim as God's final word, his third or fourth, rejects that the notion that Jesus is divine, but they do see him as a figure of respect. Christians do not accept the claims that Mohammed is a prophet, since they believe Jesus being God's final word on the matter.\n\n**What does this all tell us?**\n\nFirstly, killing people hasn't worked out well, either in practice nor looking back into their shameful history. Thankfully, most religions have agreed to get along and co-exist and recognize each others' right to believe what they want, even as they reject those beliefs. Several multi-faith conferences have made many a pronouncement of mutual respect and if not outright recognition of each others' claims, at least an outright recognition of each others' *right* to claim their own beliefs. Which is a good response to the stalemate.\n\nHowever, when it comes down to it, religious and doctrinal differences have demonstrated multiple facts:\n\n1. Theists cannot convince each other of their own truths, and thus we have multiple religions. There are religions that accept this difference such as Hinduism and others (*cough* Abrahamic ones *cough*) that won't.\n\n2. Christian branches cannot convince each other of their own specific doctrinal differences. Hence, we see many branches of incompatible denominations stemming from one deity/deities/deity-aspects depending on which branch you belong to. If one branch tells another \"The Mormons are to be considered as unbaptized and so the marriage of one of them with a Catholic without the dispensation from the impediment granted by the competent authority—the ordinary of the place—is invalid, not just illicit.\" that is a guarantee there is an irreconcilable difference.\n\nThe real reason for this is that religions don't start from a shared reality - they can't since their reality is supernatural, philosophical or metaphysical. In practice, religions *end* in our shared reality, they *start* with their supernatural claims. \n\nImportantly, it is their supernatural claims on the observable, material universe are also incompatible.\n\n**What aboutisms**\n\nWhilst having a different philosophical or metaphysical foundation may be the *reason* for these differences, it doesn't really explain them. One might be tempted to compare to the secular world and retort that there are different branches of science that are incompatible with each other - is physics and genetics really describing the same thing? The answer here is simple: they aren't incompatible because they talk about the same testable reality - they're just describing different aspects of the same thing. Much like Hinduism suggests that all religions are worshiping the same thing, or even how the Trinity is really three god-aspects as a single godhood. \n\nThe sciences also don't contradict each other (even though hypotheses will and should disagree - that's the point). Whereas religions are absolutely incompatible to the extent that they reject each others' claims, even within the same religion!\n\nEvolution stands out, not only, as an example of science over religion, but how the disciplines inform each other to confirm these disparate views of the universe and to all point to evolution being granted the honor of being called the Theory of Evolution. They can even speak the same language of math such that theories can even cut through previously unlinked areas of science - Chaos theory, information theory, and thermodynamics inform the patterns in physics, biological systems, geological systems, genetics and neurology. The unification of all science towards the Grand Theory of Everything may be illusive and even prove to be illusionary but to discover connections between the math at a microscopic level apply to the cosmological is exciting as it is hard to fathom.\n\nIt must also be noted that science is a methodology and a set of objective standards that in theory should be immune to politics and greed. The shame of faking data or making monumental the incorrect pronouncements (eg the whole silicon-based life form thing) or being sued should terrify most scientists to hew to those rules. \n\nTheists don't have the equivalent tools to determine what is true, in an independent, objective way. So much so that a known charlatan can literally build a new branch of Christianity out of whole cloth and sustain it to become one of the largest, certainly one of the richest, Christian denominations.\n\n\n\n**A Better what-aboutism**\n\nSo, science is a pretty poor analogy so what's a better one? If we ignore their claims on the origins of the universe and any of their material claims, a better analogue to religion is political science, where a Communist's view of how to run a country is very different and entirely incompatible with Capitalism or a Dictatorship. In fact, political ideologies are a perfect example given the number of people that have had to die for one cause or another, and the over-reliance of a charismatic leader.\n\n\n**Theists have zero proof**\n\nThe end result of thousands of years of disagreements, isn't agreements, it's not even an agreement to disagree (as seen by the Catholic rejection of Mormonism) - these are absolute and irreconcilable differences that demonstrate that there is very little in their on religion's claims that are sufficient to convince another.\n\nThere is only one conclusion - that theists have zero proof of their claims that is convincing to other theists outside of their religious circle.\n\nAmerica was founded on the principle of freedom of religion, constitutionally founding itself as a secular (a-religious, a-theistic) country, with a non-religious legal system. This legal system was obviously informed by Christian tradition, although not explicitly stated and thus we had laws against homosexuality, for example. Although it has taken time to do so, as we iterated and learned about ourselves, we even have gay marriage today. This is a solid example of religious morality unable to survive facts, even though within the various conservative conferences they would still frown upon The Gay.\n\nSo if there's something atheists and theists can agree on is the less religion the better when it comes to running a country.\n\n**A better word**\n\nThe word \"proof\" is often conflated with mathematical proof, or scientific evidence, or philosophical conclusions. This is a common misdirection by theists to mask the fact their claims are anything but proof, as understood by the layman (who wouldn't be able to understand a detailed proof anyway). \n\nWithin the religion, the claims are considered proof, but that's only because they already believe and part of the in-group's groupthink. As discussed above, the out-group obviously disagrees. \n\nA better term is \"reasons\" - theists should say they have reasons to believe that the Cosmological argument is  convincing to them. Even more honest, is that those beliefs are based subjective personal reasons to choose one set of supernatural beliefs over another. \n\nTo claim to be \"true\" or \"objective\" in a universally applicable sense is where things fall apart philosophically, metaphysically and in reality, for each religion when they encounter an out-group, or in the case when a new idea doesn't pass muster, the only option is that a schism happen. \n\nAnd religions are starting to realize this in their multi-faith pronouncements of a universal need for humanity to have religion, regardless of claims. In this, importantly, a polytheistic approach akin to Hinduism's seems to be the agreed upon way forward, even though they decry each other as apostates, sacrilegious, heathens, or pagan privately. \n\nThere is so little \"there\" there in the metaphysical claims of theists and religions, that rather than converging throughout our thousand of years of practice, they split and diverge even more. The gay marriage thing and female priests thing are clear indications of a bad foundation that can be made to claim both sides of an argument to be true, simultaneously. \n\nAnd it's all down to the misused term of \"proof\", that clearly, there is zero of when it comes to religion. Every theist belongs to a religion via personal choice of joining or staying or being forced to stay through indoctrination or coercion. \n\nProof doesn't even come into the picture. \n",

  "selftext": "Honestly I find myself preferring the company of my cat and husband over any other socializing because I usually don't enjoy being around other people very much, especially strangers. Maybe it's mostly because I'm an introvert or because of social anxiety or my general mistrust of people due to bad experiences I've had in my childhood. I'm not sure. But ever since I became an atheist I have started seeing people more as fake and selfish. I try not to be too pessimistic but I do get the sense that humanity is chaotic and self destructive due to:\n\n1. How everything (or almost everything) is run in a selfish way, with ulterior motives. It's \"scammy\" and there's always people taking advantage of other people. Lots of things are lies. Politicians lie. Advertisors lie. Media lies. Religion lies. Psychic mediums lie. Reality tv lies (I should know because I've worked in that industry and I've seen how it's structured). Celebrities lie. Social media lies. And one group of people always hates another group of people. I feel like there's so much corruption everywhere. And also I feel like there's so much general stupidity amongst the public, especially online.\n\nAnd 2. How a lot of people in general treat others (people, animals, nature) badly. Often without even being self aware about it and they believe themselves to be \"good\" and \"right\" (this is probably subjective, but you get what I mean, people in general don't show much respect for others except themselves)\n\nI think genuinely good people do exist, but they are hard to find.\n\nBut to be clear, I do think most people have good in them, but unfortunately it's just mixed in with the bad / less good, hence the awful behavior we see all around us.\n\nAlso, I think I'm a pretty empathetic person and I try my best to always be nice to everyone, but I always come across people that walk all over me and it sometimes makes me want to abstain from going outside (and even abstain from going online because it's overwhelming to see how bad the world is) because it makes me feel so exhausted.\n\nDoes anyone else feel the same way?",

Others attending know he's an atheist, which they disapprove of.\n\nHe wants to speak at the funeral but is imagining people glaring daggers at him and being in front of a hostile crowd. My advice to him was to go for it, for the following reasons:\n\n* For many Christians, if not most, the pastor's ramblings at the funeral are just filler material. They are a part of what they consider \"doing right by\" the deceased. The real value they get from the funeral is interacting with and hearing from others who knew her.\n* His feelings are likely influenced by the [spotlight effect](https://yourbias.is/the-spotlight-effect). It is unlikely that people would feel so strongly about his presence that they would act like a raging asshole by preventing him from speaking or disrupting his tribute.\n* The more hardcore Christian family members he has problems might be hoping he'll be \"saved\" by attending, rather than wishing he would go away.\n* He won't be the only one uncomfortable there. There are Catholics in the family who will find the speaking in tongues (if it happens) jarring. The occasional jumpscare of \"praise him!\" belted out from the person next to them without warning will also guarantee he's not the only anxious person there.\n* He has no obligation to bring up the subject of faith at all. If he only speaks about his memories of the deceased, the omission would hardly be noticed.\n\nDid I provide sound advice? Are there reasons he shouldn't speak?",

They're the type who simultaneously reject Christianity as a bunch of made-up nonsense while also believing that Judeo-Christian traditional morals are 100% correct. 10 years ago, these people would've been staunch atheists in the alt-right movement, now they're essentially indistinguishable from Christian fundamentalists.\n\nAnd beyond just the flat-out conservative atheists who now ally with religious zealots, there is a much larger group of atheists who reject liberal social values in the name of \"believing in science.\" During the Bush years, most atheists were firmly in the liberal camp and agreed on liberal issues like supporting the environment, civil rights for LGBT people and racial minorities, and funding social programs. Now though, it feels like a lot of atheists (maybe not a majority, but a significant chunk nonetheless) basically treat left-wing political beliefs as being equivalent to and just as big of a threat as organized religion. I understand being against the silly excesses of \"woke\" college students (which have been a thing since at least the 60s, long before people were complaining about SJWs in the 10s). However, when did \"believing in science and reason\" turn into being transphobic, buying into biological essentialism on the topics of race and sex, and believing in every conspiracy theory under the sun? I can't count the number of \"centrist\" atheists I've run into online who are firmly anti-religion, but also insist that trans women are men, that black people genetically have lower IQ than white people, and that women are biologically driven to mate with only \"alpha\" men.\n\nAnd since when did \"degeneracy\" enter into the atheist's lexicon? I get that people's upbringing and culture has an impact on their personal morals, but guys, really? At least organized religions have thousands of years and billions of adherents to point to when they do moral grandstanding; why the fuck should anyone take you seriously when you do it? I personally think it's a tragedy when renowned atheists like Richard Dawkins espouse the same conservative morals as their religious counterparts, because it means that religions' stranglehold on society is even deeper than I thought, when even our community is too close-minded and cowardly to challenge its moral underpinnings.\n\nAgain, I don't think that conservatives make up a majority of atheists, but I'm worried that the trends are moving in the wrong direction.",

  "selftext": "\nHey guys, I’m just looking for advice on how to deal with overly religious parents that are very closed minded. \n\nMy dad, ever since joining his new church 10 years ago has slowly changed. He’s become much more opinionated, rude, right wing, and a conspiracy theorist. I just finished a convo with him about how he thinks my body is being ruined because of the covid vaccine and how the nanobots in the vaccine are the cause. He constantly tells me I need to accept Jesus because I can’t be happy without Jesus. I can over hear him talking about me saying things like he thinks I’m depressed because I don’t have god, I have no purpose, etc. I’m actually at the best point in my life I’ve ever been at.\n\nHe’s constantly bashing non Christians, bashing LGBT people calling them insane (when my one sister came out as bi, he ugly cried and said he loves god more than his kids so he can’t accept her like that), bashing “big pharma”, bashing evolution, bashing climate change believers, bashing covid vaccinated people, etc. He said the world has gone mad because some people use CE instead of AD when referring to years. He tried to convince my sister not to give her new baby any vaccines because he thinks they cause autism. He told me the Native American genocide was justified because it was a war. The list goes on. We disagree on almost every topic you can think of. The disagreement is not the issue, because I disagree with my mom on all these things but we have respectful conversations. With him it’s condescension, aggressiveness, mocking, etc. like he’ll literally laugh in my face and say I’m lost in life if I say something political he disagrees with. He also tells me we’re in the “biblical end times” and I need to get right with god before it’s too late. He tells me I “need to be prayed for” too. His church thinks the pope is the anti Christ, and my mom is catholic. It’s a very bad combo.\n\nAll of this is making me not even want to be around him. I avoid family dinners (with my mom and him) because of this. He won’t listen and thinks I’m delusional. It also doesn’t help that my mom and sister and brother in law all agree with his views so dinner convos usually turn into a 1v4 debate when I just wanna eat and talk about our day. \n\nNot sure what to do about this. I’ve left a ton of info out to keep this short. I understand this isn’t the worst it could be, by far, but it’s causing a strain in my relationship with my family and I don’t want that. Has anyone dealt with a similar situation? Thanks.",

  "selftext": "I find it really odd that if you say to a Christian you find the idea that Jesus rose from the dead to be not likely they normally respond with one of the following statements:\n\n1. Paul says 500 people saw Jesus. \n\n2. The apostles all ( that word all is important) died for their belief in Jesus's resurrection. \n\n3. We have eyewitness accounts of Jesus's life. \n\nResponse:\n\n1. Paul is clearly a conman. He is attempting to co-opt the cult Peter, and James had going. He is attempting to shoe horn himself in as an apostle. To do this he tells many fantastical stories, that the Jerusalem apostles eventually disagree with. Paul also believed Jesus would return in his lifetime. He didn't. So really this is just a claim that can be dismissed based on its source. \n\n2. It cannot be established as a historical likelyhood what most of the eleven did after Jesus died. They are little more than names. In any case cult members regularly die for the things their cult believes. Their (cult members ) fanatical support for a leader doesn't necessarily end if the leader dies. Particularly if the leader for tells his own death. Which it is likely the historical Jesus did. \n\n3. We have no such thing. Paul never knew the historical Jesus ( if there was one). The synoptics were written by anonymous authors. These stories are filled with events based loosely on Old testament stories, and Greco-Roman mythology. John claims to have been written, or sourced from the beloved disciple. Although it diverges from the synoptics in many ways. It's purported authorship comes with a spurious tradition that John the son of zebedee lived late into the first century. Of course both Mark, and Matthew contain a story where Jesus promises that the sons of zebedee will be martyred.\n\n There is no good reason to believe that illiterate fisherman, and whatever James the purported brother of Jesus did for work wrote the epistles bearing their names. It's incredibly unlikely that these uneducated men would have an indepth understanding of history, theology, philosophy, and rhetoric. There is a massive bulk of literary works penned to every imaginable NT figure. Many early church fathers believed some of these works were legitimate. \n\nOf very course the core elements of these three claims, persuction, the purported public nature of the events, and eyewitnesses attestation could be equally argued for Islam, and Mormonism. Most Christians ( except for Mormons) would not accept these as evidence for these other movements. Most likely they didn't arrive at Christianity being true because of the strength of its claims.

  "selftext": "I grew up watching the men in my family—my brothers, fathers, and uncles—wholeheartedly embrace the  patriarchal teachings of the Bible. \n\nIt deeply frustrated me how the women in my family (most anyway) internalized these tenets so deeply that they were blind to their own subjugation. \n\nSince childhood we were taught to view our second-class status as an honor, cherishing the crumbs of 'respect' and 'protection' doled out by men who see themselves as guardians of virtue.\n\nThe irony was stark. \n\nThese men, believing themselves to be noble protectors, are (mostly) unwitting participants in a system of oppression. \n\nThe belief that women are inherently lesser, needing protection and guidance, is a toxic narrative fed to us all from birth, deeply embedded in our subconscious, influencing every interaction, every decision. Even though they would deny it loudly to the end. \n\nConservative interpretations of the Bible are  used to uphold a divine hierarchy that places men firmly above women even while assuring women that they are somehow equal. \n\nWomen don’t even notice their childlike status in their relationships. They are kept in a perpetual state of dependency. \n\nMost of the women I grew up around had no money outside of what their husbands gave them, they had no autonomy, and were completely dependent on their men for their survival. \n\nWe were taught this was godly. \n\nTo me it seemed convenient and like a breeding ground for abuse. \n\nYet, men in my community believe in the righteousness of their dominance, viewing it as a form of honor and protection. \n\nThey are oblivious to the damage this worldview inflicts not only on women but on their own integrity, chaining them to an unjust and outdated ideology.\n\nI don’t have an issue with trad gender roles if both parties choose it, but can you choose something that has been beaten into your skull since infancy?\n\nMy sisters and I were groomed for subservient roles from birth, although i admit that it didn’t work out very well - somehow at least half of us were more headstrong than my father would have liked. \n\nMaybe our “rebellion” was because we read Leviticus 12, and noticed the disparity in purification rituals for the birth of a son versus a daughter, or the sin offerings required for menstruation (Leviticus 15:19-30). We  couldn’t help but see a system that demeaned our very biology.  We were told a woman in the old days  could be stoned if she didn’t scream loud enough during a sexual assault and that it was the divine will of god that it be so. \n\nThese were so obviously not the dictates of a just and loving deity, but the superstitions of ancient men, echoing through the ages.\n\nMaybe my deconversion was  because I borrowed my dad’s collection of writing by St Thomas Aquinas that sat right next to his Bible and Strongs Concordance and read, “As regards the individual nature, woman is defective and misbegotten.” \n\nClearly the founding fathers of Christianity and apologetics ingested the biblical misogyny and continued to propagate even today .\n\nYet, voicing such doubts is taboo. \n\nWe were admonished to not lean on our own understanding but to submit to a divine plan that seemed more like the machinations of men rather than the will of God.\n\nQuestioning this system, wondering aloud if this isn't all just the legacy of an ancient desert cult, is met with accusations of faithlessness and rebellion.\n\nIt was a painful realization that the divine bargain promised by the faith of my father is no divine decree at all but a human construct which works to maintain a gender hierarchy. \n\nThe saddest part? \n\nEven the enforcers of this system, the men in my life, are victims of its lies, believing they're upholding honor and righteousness by perpetuating our oppression. \n\nThis isn't about divine inspiration; it's about human control, wrapped in the guise of holiness but  far from the heart of divine love.\n\n(Cross posted - seems appropriate to put it here too)",

However, they do exist, as I found out a little earlier today.\n\nI was at university, and out of nowhere some guy comes over and shakes my hand, asking about what I was studying and if I enjoyed it or not. I presumed he was from the Student Union and was interested in the thoughts of random students concerning their courses. He seemed nice, but something felt a little off. I was too polite and too uncomfortable to end the conversation.\n\nEventually, he gets to the gist of why he was speaking to me. As soon as he mentioned god my heart sank. I had fallen for the oldest trick in the book. Get people talking to try and force your beliefs onto them. He rambled on at me, despite my best efforts to tell him I am an atheist and that my transport home was nearly here. His 'killer' argument was that if there was evidence that a god existed, that deity would no longer be a god, and that we could all be gods if that was the case.

Each person is like an actor who wants to run the whole show; is forever trying to arrange the lights, the ballet, the scenery and the rest of the players in his own way \n\nIf his arrangements would only stay put, if only people would do as he wished, the show would be great. Everybody, including himself, would be pleased. Life would be wonderful. In trying to make these arrangements our actor may sometimes be quite virtuous. He \r\nmay be kind, considerate, patient, generous; even modest and self-sacrificing. On the other hand, he may be mean, egotistical, selfish and dishonest. But, as with most humans, he is more likely to have varied \r\ntraits. What usually happens? The show doesn’t come off very well. He begins to think life doesn’t treat him right. He decides to exert himself more. He becomes, \r\non the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the case may be. Still the play does not suit him. Admitting he may be somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people are more to blame. He becomes \r\nangry, indignant, self-pitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he not really a self-seeker even when trying to be kind? Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness out of this \r\nworld if he only manages well? Is it not evident to all the rest of the players that these are the things he \r\nwants? And do not his actions make each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the show? Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer of confusion rather than harmony?\n\n\nFinishing thoughts: I’m pretty sure it’s just a fancy way of saying “you’re a selfish entitled child who refuses to com back to a place you’ve never considered home and where you suffered religious abuse, I got over all of my problems and came back look at what a big responsible adult I am.” Big words for someone who went to AA because his drinking and temper were tearing his second marriage apart. I am beyond pissed. I just needed somewhere to vent, thanks for letting me get it out.",

  "title": "Sometimes I wish a good higher being existed. Existential vent.",
  "selftext": "When I was about 19, I went through an existential phase and I panicked a lot after I started questioning religions and all my years of being a catholic Christian. I started questioning everything. Other religions. I even tried reading about people proving their point as to why God exists. Those people somehow think that they have a strong evidence and proof but there really is none and it all doesn't make sense to me. Religions were obviously man made at that point. I went through a phase of having death anxiety because all my life I was comforted by an afterlife. Anyways, now I am 28 and I am kind of questioning things again. \n\nSometimes it feels sad sad we're just lonely beings floating is space and that is it. We're just created out of a random chance. We aren't here for a reason. We aren't special. Okay, we probably are special. Probably the fact that complex living beings exist is special. But nobody cares about us. We have a beginning and an end. \n\nSometimes I feel like I wish there was some meaning to our souls or something. Or good things for our favor that existed outside of the natural realm and all the things that humans or robots are able to detect or experience. I would want to be spiritual, yet I am not convinced and feel like I'm being delusional. \n\nFirst, what if a higher being(s) do exist? We obviously have 0 evidence for that. People are gonna be like \"You will find the answer in the Quran or Bible\". Um no thanks that's not the kind of evidence that I want. Also, there are people who convert to Islam because of an emotional reaction they got when reading the Quran. Imo, I think it's just a normal psychological reaction. Like they've had some suppressed emotions or traumas and the idea of the Quran made them feel like they are allowed to \"submit\" or kind of surrender which makes them feel like they are allowed to let their guard down for a while (something they've been avoiding for a long time). And crying is a normal reaction. There's more explanations to that but just because people get an emotional reaction to a holy book doesn't make the holy book true. We need to look at what happened psychologically. \n\n\nBut then again, even if higher beings exist, what does that mean? What if they just don't care about us worshipping them? What if they don't care about how we live on Earth and what we do? Also, just because there might be higher beings doesn't mean there is an afterlife. What if they don't care about our sex lives? We really have no evidence whatsoever. I don't think we've ever had anything close to an evidence in history NO MATTER what people try to convince you with. Word blabber and salad isn't going to work for me. \n\n\nAnyways, sometimes I wish a good higher being existed and NOT like the one of Islam. No thanks. Also, their promised things in heaven aren't that appealing to me. Or even Christianity, which I think is still better than the God of Islam. I wished that there was some sort of higher meaning to our lives. But then again, all of these are just soothing and comforting ideas that help with our uncertainties and anxieties.",

Some non-believers view it as right or wrong. Both often view things as legal or illegal.

  "selftext": "A friend of mine is very religious in a New Age church.  I've even gone once so I know what it's like.  I went to be open-minded and because they have been some of the most devoted friends I've ever had (married family with kids).  Our friendship grew apart because my daughter (we met thru our kids) has grown up to be very progressive and no longer wants a friendship with their daughter. Their daughter thinks being gay is a sin and my daughter does not.  She feels this friend would judge her friends (trans, gay, etc.) so she no longer communicates with her.  It's really rather sad because they used to be such good friends.  I still text the mom periodically, but I think she resents the situation. The mom also knows I am not a believer.  Even still she always states things about Jesus or advice containing religion to me. \n\nLast week, I happened to be at her work and texted her.  We sometimes meet up to say hi, but her response was short and not engaging.  She responded later and I asked how she was and what her daughter was up to since we don't text much.  She didn't respond to that. \n\nSo last night, I'm deleting contacts out of my phone and decided to delete her number just out of practicality.  She just doesn't seem interested in a friendship at all.  It's just in response to me.  I don't like ghosting people so I said:\n\n\"Thank you so much for your friendship.  You were a great friend to me.   I'm deleting your number and just want you to know that I won't reach out again.'\n\nShe hasn't initiated contact in over a year, maybe longer.   We live really close.   I take that as a sign that I'm the one carrying the friendship and that it's not wanted.  Am I wrong in that?  \n\nHer response:\nI'm sorry your feeling that way. I forgot to answer yr text because I had surgery on the 2nd and forgot about the message that was sent. \nI hope all is well with you and pray you will find peace and comfort in Jesus. \n\nI knew nothing of her surgery. Shouldn't friends know those things?  And, why can't she respect that I don't believe in Jesus?  I respect that she does and have even bought her gifts with her religion in mind because that's what she believes.  \n\nAm I wrong to expect others to do the same and respect that's not who I am?  Am I wrong to take it as a sign when someone doesn't reach out, ever, that the friendship is not wanted?  And honestly, I'm annoyed she always has to add Jesus in every text.  I find it disrespectful of my views.  \n\nPlease tell me where I'm wrong in any of this.  I'd like the feedback before I respond or don't.",

  "selftext": "I was a Christian for most of my life, and I didn't grow up in your typical ordinary Church, more of an extreme cult, extreme in every way possible, they used to perform exorcisms on me to cast out demons. I used to do all the Christian magic tricks, speak in tongues, have so called prophetic dreams, hearing voices thinking God was talking to me, I was part of the Churches band. The pastor was treated like Jesus, I mean when people started dating they had to go to the pastor and ask him for permission, and if the pastor said no, you have to break up with the person, this pastor called himself a prophet and apostle.\n\nI spend a lot of time living in fear of hell, feeling guilty of my thoughts and feelings. I was like a robot just following orders. I gave up so much of my time and energy. I missed out on a lot of things and experiences due to being Christian. I gave up a lot of friends, or potential friends I could have made. Now I'm an Atheist, I had to spend a lot of time de-programming my brain, seeing things in a new way. My mind feels stuck, Atheist mind, but Christian instincts still lingering inside me somewhere because that's all my mind has ever known for most of my life. I spend all my mental bandwidth on Christianity, and I feel I have none left for this newer Atheist life, and now I'm exhausted, my brain hurts, I just feel tired. My brain feels underdeveloped and I don't even know who I am.\n\nWhen I see other people who are Atheist from the start, they just seem free from the shackles of religion, they grow up without having to worry about heaven or hell, or having to feel guilty about thoughts or feelings, being able to befriend whoever they want, date whoever they want, watch whatever they want, listen to whatever music they want. They mature and grow up without the belief in a God or fear of hell holding them back. I'm jealous when I see Atheist like this. Heck I think I'm even jealous of religious people who don't really take their religion that seriously and do whatever they want anyways.\n\nIdk, I wish I was an Atheist from the start.",

  "selftext": "A lot of Religious people don't actually believe what their religious text says, they BELIEVE what they think their religious text says. Rendering all honest discussion fruitless and impossible. \n\nA stupid religious kid claimed that those that have abortions go to Hell. And I told him that his God isn't pro life, that his God doesn't think an unborn child is worth as much as it's mother. \n\n I qouted Exodus 21: 22-25 :\n\n\"22 “If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely[a] but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman’s husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\"\n\nTo which he replied that I'm making the same mistake every pro life person makes, of qouting the wrong bible, that the NIV  version which he follows is different to RSV bible. While this in itself is infurriating moving of the goal post, the real issue is, that what I qouted was literally from the NIV Bible...\n\nRSV bible's version is: \n\n22 “When men strive together, and hurt a woman with child, so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no harm follows, the one who hurt her shall[a] be fined, according as the woman’s husband shall lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23 If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n\nSo basically it's poteito potato, just because it's a few different words doesn't change the inherent meaning behind what is actually being said...\n\nAnd that is that the life of an unborn child is worth a mere monetary compensation, compared to the living mother. But nope I'm clearly qouting the wrong bible (🙈 🙉) despite the essence of both being generally the same...\n\nHe then wants to point out that all life is sacred because God said that Thou Shall not kill. To which I told him that the commandement clearly didn't extend to gentiles considering the many instances of genocide the God's chosen people commited under Moses and Joshua which were directly endorsed by their God. \n\nTo which he concluded that I'm \"an Angry Leftists and that non of it really matters because I'm going to burn in Hell anyway and then bloked me\"\n\nI have to say, kids like him could use an ass whopping or 2 to learn some manners and respect, but I digress. The point is, for the most part I don't think his behavior differs all that much to most religious people in the West.\n\nThey are lazy both intellectually and morally. They don't care what their religious text actually says, what they actually care about is the false sense of superiority it gives them with no actual effort on their part. It's impossible to argue with them because from their POV you are not engaging with them in a discusion of ideas and reason, you are laying siege at the very foundation of their Ego. Because that's what it really is. Their beliefs are not a product of internalized study of scripture, it's the product of the conviction that they are special, correct and chosen by the universe and you are not.\n\nWith that in mind, is there any actual point on having a discusion with such juvenile individuals?",

  "selftext": "Why would God need to test us. According to major religions, God is omnipotent and all-knowing. Why would an all knowing God need to test us when he already knows the outcome? \n\nHere’s what theists say:\n\n1. “Do not confuse the 2: knowing and testing. Knowing means indisputable awareness of truth. Testing means questioning to find truth in knowledge. If you combine these God tests us to see if we have found the truth in our knowledge of God, and we accept and embrace that knowledge.\nGod knows what God knows, but is that knowledge absolute, also unknown.”\n\nMy Response: This doesn’t answer why he would need to question to find the truth if he already knows the truth.\n\n2. “There's a test and there's a trial. The trial is designed to teach, and the test shows you what you've learned from the trial.”\n\nMR: This doesn’t answer the question. He refers to life as the “trial” and death as the “test” of going to heaven or hell. Why would an omnipotent God need to test anything. Testing implies he either doesn’t know the outcome, or is doing it out of leisure. If so, an all powerful deity seems to have a very sadistic view of leisure. \n\n3. “A coach may know your potential, but until he puts you in the game, you will not know it.\nThe tests are for our benefit, so we can see what He can do through us.\nJust as in life, the more committed we are to a goal, the more we can endure that which keeps us from it.\nTests are needed so that we CAN achieve goals, because the most worthy goals seem to have obstacles.\nSo, thank God for every \"test\" because it causes us to achieve more than knowing what we can do, it DEMONSTRATES what we DID do.”\n\nMR: Coaches do not know your potential for sure, they theorize it. The tests so not benefit those who go to hell. Why would an all powerful God care about us being able to “see what he does through us”. That would imply he has feelings to care, and thus is limited to emotions. Not very omnipotent. Why does us achieving goals matter to an omnipotent God who already knows what goals we can achieve.",

  "selftext": "This is very embarrassing and I cant bring myself to tell this to anyone IRL but its the truth. I am a 26M. I have been a closeted atheist in a very traditional/conservative Muslim household since I was 20. Prior to this I was the most religious member of my family. My whole identity and social circle was based on my religion. when I transitioned into atheism my friends/family took notice. At 20 years old my best friend excommunicated me and in the efforts of trying to reconcile things with him his father intercepted and told me that I was a piece of shit and \"when you hang around shit you start to stink\". This made me feel very insecure about my transition. I thought to myself that it would be best to remain distant with my family because if they found out it would be result in them excommunicating me. This caused me to feel very isolated and gave me a sense of ostracization. This lead to anxiety attacks/depression and 110lbs of weight gain. My house became a huge source of stress for me which left me restless.\r  \n\r  \nAt 25 years old I was experiencing some hard ships in life which pushed me back to believing in my religion for a sense of peace. I had a honey moon phase with my rebound to religion. My anxiety cleared up and I started to lose a good amount of weight (40lbs). I got back into the religion really hard I mean one extreme to the other. I took all the teachings literally. One particular teaching was that everything that happens in life was destined to happen by God; from our actions to external factors. As someone with crippling anxiety this brought me a lot of peace. I took it to an extreme though. I brainwashed myself to believe that anything good/bad that happens to me is a result of gods will and has no correlation from my efforts or other factors. I attributed my weight loss to God, if my phone fell out of m pocket it wasn't for physical reasons it was Gods will, if a light bulb went out it wasn't because it was at the end of its run it was gods will that it went out. Obviously this perception of the world is completely irrational but I seen it as a test from god to see if I will commit to the belief. I essentially disavowed the concept of cause and effect which our universe operates on and attributed everything to gods will. This caused me to believe that I had no free will of my own and i was practically a robot that operated on gods will. I suppressed my conscious self to so stay consistent with this method. Whenever something happened and my mind would come to a rational conclusion about it I would convince myself it wasn't true and it was gods will that caused it to be so. This lead to extreme mental and physical fatigue due to the cognitive dissonance and perception of my actions having no correlative effect on the results throwing my brains reward system out of whack. I completely lost my appetite and lost 100 lbs. I had consistent headaches, my brain literally felt like it was boiling. I finally snapped out of it after 5 months after a few incidents that almost ended my life. I guess what was keeping me committed to these delusions was not wanting to go back to recognizing the world as chaotic thus inducing my anxiety. Also by implication this means that my deep religious convictions were all in my head and i am having trouble distinguishing thought from reality. This experience has been traumatizing and I feel so alone. I was researching my conditions and the closest thing i can find was it being a psychotic break.",

Given the “non-dematerialized” nature of the registers, the *“data is only accessible to interested parties for the information that concerns them, as well as to ministers of religion and people working under their authority,*” notes the court. “*This data is not accessible to third parties*” and kept “*in a closed place*,” it adds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2014, the Cour de Cassation had already rejected the appeal of a man who wanted to see the mention of his sacrament removed from the parish register. She had considered that “*from the day of its administration and despite its denial, baptism constituted a fact whose historical reality could not be contested”*.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe decision of the Conseil d'Etat is “interesting” given the fact that it is the first time that it has to rule in the context of the application of the [Règlement général de protection des données](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) (RGPD), in force in France since 2018, notes Nicolas Hervieu, professor of public law. “*But this is the position of the French Conseil d'Etat which interprets European law. It is not certain that Supreme Courts in other EU states will rule in the same direction*,” he told AFP. “*Some could potentially question the Court of Justice of the EU” on this point, but it is “it which has the last word*”.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you think this decision makes sense ? Is it really important to erase the mention of a baptism when you leave christianity ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n( As the translation is imperfect coming from Google Translate, I can clarify things unclear)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit : typo and additional links.",

They say that you can't prove something is true, only reject something that is proven to be false. You can't prove God is false, therefore you can't make the claim he isn't real, only that you don't have evidence he is real.\n\nGiven that the only way to demonstrate anything is true or false is using the laws of physics, and God violates those, can't you simply say his existence is not true on that alone? If you aren't willing to reject God being real then anything you experience in the world could be a result of a miracle God caused. You could make the claim that \"All turtles are bigger than the earth\" but you can't reject the claim because every time you try to measure them, a miracle could bend reality to trick you. How could ever prove that anything is true or not if you can't say that miracles are not true?\n\nIs this something anyone actual thinks is a reasonable claim to make, or is it just done to shut down theists by making it clear they have a burden of proof?\n\nEdit: I feel I may have been unclear. My point is that people should make the statement \"God isn't real\" instead of \"I don't have enough evidence to convince me God is real\" Since people make definitive statements like that about everything else in life. if someone asks me if the full moon is out I don't say \"I don't have enough evidence to convince me the full moon is out\" I say \"No\"",

It was highly successful and my cancer is in remission, so it's all good.\n\nThis is not to say the recovery process isn't grueling.  I spent many weeks bed ridden while recovering from the chemotherapy dose they give you for the BMT.  While you stay at clinic the care is comprehensive: not only do you have the nurses and doctors working on you but you have people stopping by to make sure you are financially OK, mentally OK, safe at home, and (of course) if you're spiritually OK.\n\nSo one afternoon a priest walks in (I think Catholic since he was in black and had the collar, but I'm not entirely sure) and asks if I have any spiritual needs.  The conversation was brief:\n\n\"Would you like me to pray with you?\" he asks.\n\n\"No thanks\".\n\n\"Do you mind if I pray for you?\"\n\n\"If it makes you happy.\"\n\n\"You don't believe in god?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nHis eyes widened and he took a step back like I just slapped him.  Obviously my response came as quite a surprise. He mumbled a few words and beat a hasty retreat.\n\nThe look on his face was so satisfying.  I've wanted to thank him for making me feel much better that day and give me something nice to remember from the time in the hospital.",

In nearly every/any religion(not just Christianity) when a devil-like figure is brought up, he is this \"Evil bad guy who likes everything bad\" which is a fine summary. however, I found that he never actually states what he believes in. No religious text I found says \"The devil said do blank or be like blank\" It is always second-handed.\n\nWhat's even weirder was I noticed that The Devil according to religious speakers has believed in TONS of good things or at least things I enjoy. I never understood why God is against things I enjoy/support while the Devil isn't. When the louder religious speakers talk about what the devil believes in he just sounds like a better person than I originally thought.\n\nWhy is it that the \"big evil bad guy\" is for things like feminism, believing in yourself, magic, parties, holidays, the LGBTQ, and interracial marriage, he never condoned slavery(Yet God did), and he is against pedophilia and racism, this list just goes on and on, it just gets more confusing as when growing up this was a figure to be feared.\n\ni am not saying that religious people are for those, but it does seem like the religious text and loudest speakers of these religions ARE. when I point this out to religious people they just start to \"true Scotsman \"ing me.\n\nif I were making a religion or story I'd have my \"big evil bad guy\" doing bad things, but while growing up and reading the bible I don't actually recall the devil doing anything or even saying \"Hey do something bad\" outside of the \"original sin\"  which I never understood why even have a forbidden fruit in the first place? and why a loving forgiving God is hung up over obedience. it never sat right with me.\n\ndid anyone else see this pattern of religious speakers claiming the devil is for something actually positive? or is there text I've missed that has the \"super bad evil thing\" he supports/done?\n\nEdit: Guys. I know what agnostic means. I even clicked on the FAQ link and READ it.\n\n\"An agnostic is someone who claims they don't know (\"weak agnosticism\") or it is not possible to know (\"strong agnosticism\") for certain whether or not gods exist\".\n\nI would be a weak agnostic. (although I'm also positive you can't prove for certain a god exists or not) my full belief can be summarized as simply being against religion rather than being against the belief in a God. I criticize the way religion is set up and what religion as God's character is, while being consistently wrong on the character that IT SETS UP itself.\n\nI am 100% sure I am agnostic, something that THIS subreddit said was fine to be.\n\nEdit 2: Fixed bad grammar, sorry i have a stupid grammar correction plugin and it isn't doing its job correctly.

I'm genuinely curious about the reasoning behind this priority and would love to gain some insights.\r  \n\r  \nFrom my observations, discussions around topics like vaccination, public health measures, and even broader societal norms/ conditions (homosexuality, STIs, etc ) often tilt towards championing personal autonomy and freedom of choice.

Could this rejection of religious constraints be a contributing factor to the high value placed on personal freedom here?

I figured if it wasn't too personal, then I'd read it to sort of help me get to know her better. She had already told me once before she was involved in church stuff, so I assumed it was hers. Halfway through reading the speech, it became clear that this was from a woman most likely two or three times her age. My assumption is it belonged to a guest who needed to have a copy printed, a typical request.\n\n  \nAside from losing interest in learning it wasn't about her, and thus no point in reading further, it was honestly not worth finishing from the content alone. It was terribly boring. However, one thing in particular jumped out at me while I was reading it. This woman described two instances where she tried to get someone to read the Bible. One was successful, and the other not.\n\n  \nHere's the thing: she was very descriptive when it came to the failing friend but offered almost no details whatsoever about the success. She mentions this friend, the one she convinced to read the Bible, was always so angry, and after giving him a Bible and asking him to read it— to which he agreed with almost no hesitation— he suddenly changed. He was fixed. He was no longer angry and so happy, having accepted the teachings of Jesus Christ. It was a short one-and-done paragraph with no details about what was bothering him, what specifically changed his attitude, what he connected with, or what they talked about afterwards.\n\n  \nWhen it came to the failed friend, whom she tried to get to read the Bible on multiple occasions, the guy seemed pleasant in her writings. She expounded upon him in about three or four paragraphs and ultimately gave up trying to push the subject further while still holding out hope that one day he’ll change his mind and give the Bible a chance. From there, she went on about other stuff where my mind draws a complete blank. Like I said, it wasn’t very interesting.\n\n  \nThe reason this stuck out to me is because I’m not a complete stranger to religious people and groups. I’ve seen what some may call propaganda, and others say “helpful videos.” This is also, in fact, not my first speech I’ve read from a guest involved in a religious group. Of the first speech, the second one I’ve written about here, and the video, one commonality jumped out at me. They all involved some angry friend that they got to read the Bible that suddenly changed and became happy.\n\n  \nThe first speech had no details about this friend that was so full of anger. The video never explained why one of the guys was acting like a jerk. They’re all just… I want to go as far as to say made up. Is that right? Like, I know the ones in the video, of course, but even the personal accounts? Is this a thing with religious people, or am I just overthinking it? Has any ex-believer ever had this experience for real, or even was this person before falling out?",

  "selftext": "This was a long time ago, about ten years give or take. So for context, I was born and raised in India. Not a lot of Christians in the town that I grew up in.\n\nThere are a couple of Christian doctors who with their families have been family friends of my Dad. Both of them have a bit of a reputation for hammering Christianity into literally everyone they meet. Friends, colleagues, patients, random strangers, everyone. Literally *all the time.* They talk about nothing *but* Christianity. No matter what the topic, they had a habit of bringing it around to Christianity and the Christian God.\n\nNobody ever says anything to their face because it's a small town and they've been around for a really long time and seniority - whether it's age or hierarchy or social status - carries a lot of weight in India. No nothing to do with the caste system because I'm pretty sure it's going to be the first thing you jump to.\n\nAs a kid, I liked to read a lot and they would let me borrow children's books that belonged to their grown adult children. They would also use the occasion to try and push Christian literature on me. I didn't realize until years later that they were trying to convert me. Didn't work though, the books they gave me were deadly boring and even at that age I didn't believe in god.\n\nSo about ten years ago, they discovered the internet and these things called \"mailing lists.\" So naturally they made one for their Bible group, which was basically all members sending mass emails to each other passive aggressively nitpicking at their differences in interpretation. I don't know how but they got my email from somewhere and added me to the list without asking me.\n\nThe first few emails I ignored, like I ignored the countless spam emails that occasionally made it past the filters but eventually I got irritated and I sent them this article.\n\n[We Are All Hindus Now](https://www.newsweek.com/us-views-god-and-life-are-turning-hindu-79073)\n\nThis link is to Newsweek magazine where it was published but the title is from the [article on the author's personal website.](https://lisaxmiller.com/we-are-all-hindus-now/1400) So basically I took the title from the author's personal website to deliberately make it inflammatory - without putting my words in it - while still providing the link to an established magazine so they couldn't try and discredit the source.\n\nThey went *apeshit.*\n\nEven I was startled at their reaction. I had figured when I sent the email that the most that could happen was that I might needle them a bit and that might cause them to \"forget\" my email on subsequent emails. I was not prepared for the severity of their reaction - emails upon emails affirming to each other that no Christianity is not in decline and yes Christianity is growing stronger day by day and look at the success we've had at converting the unreached in South Korea. Even their grown children - that I hadn't heard from in years personally reached out to me.\n\nIt died down eventually. I don't remember exactly when but the emails stopped coming. I don't know if they \"forgot\" my email address or the members lost interest in the group or they moved to another forum. Either way, they stopped bothering me - for a while. Recently they got my phone number from my dad and now they're sending me Fox News climate denial conspiracies on WhatsApp.",

  "selftext": "In my (M,21) country (Indonesia), religion always have a big place in the mass media (TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, online websites). Meanwhile, the existence of atheism is almost unheard of.\n\nIslam as the majority is certainly more prioritized on TV. Everyday at 4AM and 6PM, you can hear call to prayer (adzan) with it's lousy voices, then there's daily Islamic brainwashing program (here we call it 'ceramah' or 'tausiyah'). Islamic 'mental healing' practices (ruqyah) also got its own TV program. There are quite a lot of TV channels specifically for Muslims and they're usually owned by Islamic boarding schools/preachers.\n\nThere's Islamic low-budget made-for-TV movies with an easy-to-predict & illogical storyline. The protagonist is a weak, pious person & the antagonist is a petty, evil person. The latter usually regret his/her decision then repent (tobat), or get severe punishment from skydaddy until death (azab). Usually the skydaddy's 'wrath' still happened at the funeral. Low-effort 3d animation and effect makes it very funny to watch. If you're curious, you can search 'Indosiar Azab' on YouTube.\n\nThere's also Christian, Hindu, Buddhist and Confucianist programs on national TV, but not that much compared to Islam. Meanwhile, on local TV, only the religion with the largest number of adherents in that area will get prioritized (for example, Hindu programs on Balinese TV & Islamic programs on Minangnese TV).\n\nThe newspaper here usually contains weekly articles and opinions from religious figures or cultural observer who are obsessed with certain religious teachings. So I have to be very careful in choosing articles that have nothing to do with any religion.\n\nYou could easily find extremist Islam magazines in newsstands. Extremist online news websites can still be accessed and not seriously monitored by our government.\n\nI understand why ideas based on logic and rationality such as atheism do not have a place in my country. It's because most Indonesians have been so accustomed to follow certain dogmatic teachings, even before the arrival of Hindu and Buddhist people. Our ancestors used to practice animism and dynamism (worship of objects believed to have supernatural powers).\n\nAtheists are not recognized by the state because it contradicts the first principle of Pancasila (Belief in the one and only God). According to Indonesian law, atheists/agnostics are prohibited from spreading it to other people. In Indonesia, the number of atheists is very small (1,717 people according to Atheist Aliance International).\n\nThat doesn't mean I give up. I've been tired of following Islamic teachings since childhood. I don't want to be constantly exposed to the teachings of that awful cult every single day. I also don't want to be enslaved by any other religious authority. I want to live a happy life and enjoying it to the fullest. I want to helping others from a sincere heart, without any religious reasons. Lastly, even though it's difficult, I want to find a girlfriend who was also becoming an atheist like me.",

Remember, no matter how good it makes you feel, it’s not provable by definition. They are correct, you are mistaken, even if they have the good grace to not point that out.\n3) Be comfortable with your belief but don’t confuse it with reality- Humans are ill-equipped for our complicated world, and are often wrong. Believe what you want to believe. Like other fairy tales, they can have value, but that’s different from being real. \n4) Don’t panic when you start to feel insecure about your beliefs- giving up dependence on faith to get by is a sign of honesty and moral maturity.

  "selftext": "I'm sure we're all familiar with the common claim of religious people that belief in (insert their respective deity) is necessary in order to be a moral person. Even those who don't go that far typically still assert that such a belief is necessary in order to have a non-subjective basis for morality. If this were true, you would expect that religious people would tend to be the best behaved members of society. They would certainly tend to do less of the things that tend to result in incarceration.  However, this does not appear to be the case in reality.\n\nI used to work in the justice system, and my personal observation was that the inmates I encountered tended to be more religious on average than most of the people I know. I began to wonder recently if there was any actual data to back up my anecdotal experience. I found a report from the U.S. Department of Justice on the Federal Bureau of Prisons that contained inmate religious demographic data. I used this data and data from the Pew Research Center to make a spreadsheet that calculates the percentage of overrepresentation or underrepresentation in U.S. Federal Prisons for various religious affiliations. \n\nThese are the results and links to original source data:\n\n[Simplified View](https://ibb.co/nDN4nGW)\n\n[Full Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EOZwTrkms-ndSRXxqBuAQjoDCOCIcq7Eqm2-w30pnfE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General - Audit of the Federal Bureau of Prisons' Management and Oversight of its Chaplaincy Services Program](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/reports/21-091.pdf)\n\n[Pew Research Center - Religious Landscape Study](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/)",

She replied no i didn't joined Christianity i joined pita paremshowr faith which in english is the holy father(literally same).\nSO YES LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THEY CHANGED CHRISTIANITY TO HOLY FATHER RELIGION TO GET MORE PEOPLE IN THE CULT. WHEN IT IS WRITTEN IN BIBLE THAT JESUS AND HOLY FATHER ARE ONE.SHE TOLD ME SHE WILL NEVER JOIN YEHSUA PESUA( A WAY OF MOCKING SOMETHING IS NEPALI BY SAYING SAME WORD IN DIFFERENT WAY) BUT I TOLD HER IT'S SAME BUT SHE SAYS IT DIFFERENT . JESUS AND HOLY FATHER ARE DIFFERENT ACCORDING TO HER. SHE HATES CHRISTIAN BUT IS CHRISTIAN HERSELF.YET SHE GOES TO CHURCH CAN'T BLAME HER TBH SHE IS  UNEDUCATED ON BOTH HER RELIGION AND THE HOLY FATHER. the reason why she won't leave the holy father thing is because she never got sick after joining it it's literally manifestation/ law of attraction. She just developed strong faith after that which made her mentally strong lol. Pita paremshowr ( the holy father)\nis just christianity but a bit modified. the granny can celebrate Dashain tihar lhosar(hindu&buddhist festivals) her body can be burn if she dies instead of burying it. They can't drink alcohol and they have bhajans too(  hindu chanting ) but for christians its so cringe the arabic christian chanting seems better.\nIt's so sad that they changed their own religion to increase the population 😕 and yet you tell me it's not cult?\nI got badly scolded by my mother for that She says let her do whatever she wants if that makes her happy but what the christian missonaires are doing are morally unacceptable in both christianity and hinduism. I feel bad for both her and real christians. I don't hate christians tho.",

  "selftext": "I know I'm a bit late, but this week I got beaten up twice so far, but anyway: \"Happy\" World #interfaithHarmonyWeek - classically starts with Feb 1 World #HajibistasDay.  I am just extending the invitation from the World Hajibistas to all my female AND male friends: to experience the \"feeling of freedom when you completely surrender and wear a hijab for 1 day, for 1 week, for 1 month, for 1 year\".  And then I get beaten up by some woke feminists as I talk to them with a cloth over my head. Because, we men can also wear a cloth on our head and we are then supposed to talk with a very highly pinched voice indicating we are 'captured and inspired by some god or allah or something\" - a bit like the Evangelical Christians \"talking in tongues\".  But then my woke friends always ask/tell me to shut up.  \nThe next day, I got beaten up by Hajibistas and their male equivalents, because I dared to propose: ok, we all wore a hijab for 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 1 year ... now let's switch.  \nI'm telling you. All that World #interfaithHarmonyWeek gives me headaches and blues.  But ... I keep observing: if any week there's a chance for some spirit to manifest themselves - it is this week : muslim spirit, Evangelical Christian spirit, please manifest and make yourselves visible, or a Buddhist or Hindu spirit, Jewish spirit is ok too.  Please help frotting any lamp you come across this week, please? I think we should all discuss what we should do with our 3 wishes? I'm sure that if we would sent all the people who believe in science out of the room, gravity, as if we'd have been to the moon, the flat is earth. All these people who believe in nothing, they just are a bad influence, it's their fault these spirits don't want to manifest themselves.  I'm sure of it. And also the Chinese: if there's 1 billion people who don't believe anymore - isn't that too much like negative spiritual power or something? And then they say they went to the moon... but how conveniently, they parked their space ship on the \"backside of the moon\".  Come on ... that's so cheap and pathetic. Like Putin who was going to win the war in 2 days.  Yeah, sure.  What was it again: the Arch bishop of the Ukraine didn't want to be under the Arch Bishop of Russia and they have now split? This year, no orthodox spirit - I'm sure of it.  That's split spiritual power.  I hope the spirit will be visible also for non-believers, otherwise it doesn't count, right? We have a spirit who manifested himself ... but you could only see it if you belonged to the right faith.  No, that doesn't count: either we can all see the spirit, or it doesn't count.    \nRules are rules, right?  \n:)  \n https://www.un.org/en/observances/interfaith-harmony-week",

  "selftext": "I’m atheist and my girlfriend is Christian. We’ve been dating for almost a year, we love each other and all the rest. Religion has never been something we’ve talked about, I guess because it’s not a common interest of ours. Her mother is very religious and my girlfriend was raised religious; church every Sunday, praying before meals etc. \n\nMy girlfriend doesn’t go to church, since we’ve been together we’ve been to church 2 times. Once was when we visited her mother, and the other was very recently (I’ll get to that). \n\nMy girlfriend isn’t a bible thumper, she drinks, has sex, believes in gay rights etc. However, she definitely believes in God, even though I’ve never seen her do it she says she prays when she’s alone sometimes, she believes in Heaven & Hell, and doesn’t believe in evolution. \n\nWe recently had a big conversation about religion, as she wasn’t aware how atheist I was. She thought I just had a really weak connection with God. To be honest I’m not a staunch atheist, I don’t deny the existence of God, I just don’t believe in it. I respect other people’s beliefs. I’m more of a science guy who believes in evidence, not faith based stuff. But regardless just me and I respect other people’s beliefs. I do wonder if believing on how the universe was formed & operates is something to be on the same page about long-term, though. I’m not sure.\n\nAnyway, in this conversation my girlfriend said how if we have kids she wants a Christian household where the kids are to be raised Christian. She then said she’d want me to be Christian when we get married. I said I cannot guarantee I can become Christian, and can’t guarantee I’d want to raise my kids like that. She eventually said the bare minimum is that I’d at least share Christian values (and so I wouldn’t have to be Christian), but would be willing to go to church every Sunday when we have kids etc. She said at 18 the kids can decide for themselves. \n\nWe’ve kind of reached a roadblock for now and parked the conversation there. I am extremely anxious that down the road this is going to be a massive problem. Her parents are very religious, when her mom messages me she references Jesus & God etc. My girlfriend rarely references religion when we talk but she has said things like she believes God brought us together etc.\n\nMy girlfriend doesn’t read the bible. I believe she just believes in God because she was raised that way. I have a feeling if over time I asked her specific questions and got her to healthily question her beliefs she might fall out of it. The thing is I’m not sure how reliable that is or if that’s just a dick thing to do period…\n\nAny advice? Do inter-faith relationships work long term? Is there any likelihood of her falling out of faith (not saying she should, but does anyone have experience with this)? I’m really worried about this 5-10 years from now.",

I've left these atheism and exmuslim subreddits for personal reasons but as an occasional lurker I'm suggested posts from those communities and I always see the loud ex Muslim majority spewing this vile rhetoric. and I think I know the cause.\n\nAmidst the ex Muslim YouTube space, nobody has reached the heights of popularity as Apostate Prophet and while he's made interesting videos that have definitely helped in my deconstruction (I'm an ex Muslim btw), his one sided coverage of the whole Israel-Hamas war and the history of the conflict.

As i grew older, I moved into a smaller town, it’s a bit more conservative and definitely a change of scenery for me. I’ve been here for a few years and I definitely am struggling- I am around so many religious people now, which I don’t think is a bad thing- but I do feel… odd? My mom used to work as a CNA , so she is close to one of her old clients, as she used to help assist her daughter, my mother has a much better paying job right now , but we remain in close contact with her clients mother because her and my mom always got along well! Anyways, as you can imagine, over the years she’s become a close family friend. She is sweet, I assist her with work around her garden when I can, but I have not been over lately because she wants to bring me to church with her. I have never been to a church, and she is very pushy and firm about her religion? She is aware that my mom and I are not religious, but she really wants me to go to church with her, and she even has given me religious books to read. I always feel that I am being impolite when making an excuse not to go to church with her. Also, many of the people around me are christian here, and I always feel that something is wrong for me for not being brought up this way. I would like to mention that death has always been a fear of mine, as many people! However, It has worsened with the environment I am in. I am very uncomfortable with the amount of people comfortable telling me that anyone who doesn’t believe in god will go to hell. I am  still young, I am sure I am impressionable now it may seem, but this has ignited such a fear in me as of lately:( I really do believe that I try my best to be caring to everyone around me, I do not understand the thought of being sentenced to eternal suffering, although I can ensure that there are so many kind atheists with their hearts in the right place. Maybe this sounds silly lol, I am sorry! But I just can’t help but wonder, how do I cope with being non religious, when everyone around me makes it seem like it takes away from me, and what kind of person I am? I have so much trouble with being able identify as someone that doesn’t believe in god, does it make me flawed? Have a good night everyone!\n*** Update!!! hello, thank you all for your comments, I am feeling more positive and secure in my beliefs, it is nice to see people with similar beliefs as mine:] ",

What remains is, well, your typical argument cited by Christian apologists: The bible doesn't mention them because there isn't a necessity to do so.\n\n....What? Really? Why *wouldn't* the bible mention Dinosaurs? What reason there is to not mention them at all?! Can you imagine what would've happened if they did? Christians all around the world would say this is proof that the bible is scientific (ignoring all the the scientific inconsistencies, of course), apologists would be using this as a way to prove the credibility of the bible, this could very well convert thousands, millions even. An all-knowing and all-loving God would surely want this, right? Instead, more and more people are skeptical towards the scriptures, and this is one of the many reasons why.

Nothing in my moms life was outside religion. All her her time was spent in religious prayer, rituals, thought and homeopathy, everything.\n\nShe found a tiny lump on her breast almost 8 years ago. It was a slow growing tumor the doctors said, let's just pop it out, then do a bit of radiation, and you are good to go.\n\nBut not for my mom. She prayed to be healed. And bought swamp water from Mexico. Or took yet another supplement as the cancer slowly ate into her chest. And prayed some more. \n\nShe finally started to wake up a bit and decided to have a mastectomy almost 2 years ago, but it was too late. The cancer had spread to other parts of her body and kept eating into her chest. Her and her husband kept insisting that the open wound was \"toxins,\" leaving her body and just kept adding the latest quack miracle they could find. \n\nThey went in and out of care at the local cancer center. The docs would get her feeling better with meds, etc so she would go home and her husband would start \"adjusting\" her meds cuz, you know, modern medicine is hurting her and only the 84 quack supplements, electrical bracelets, and 24 hour a day prayers would cure her. She started a raw vegetable diet, which did almost kill her before they stopped\n\nShe couldn't move her arm anymore starting about a year ago and the open wound in her chest started to smell a few months ago but it was all a reason to praise God because it was the toxins leaving. Her back started to hurt a month ago, and her husband insisted it was her posture, so he bought her a vest to force her upright. He also cold turkey took her off all her pain meds as they were causing constipation, so she sat there in her vest in horrific pain praying. But she could poop again, so there's that.\n\nWell, guess what? It was not her posture. She finally had him take her to the hospital for the pain, and the cancer had eaten into her spine enough to fracture it in two places. He had her sitting upright on two fractures, grinding the bones to powder while taking aspirin for the pain, and all their friends cast out the devil.\n\nShe went straight to in-patient hospice two weeks ago. She died this morning, alone, because her husband was praying in the chapel. None of her children or grandchildren were there because he didn't tell us. He just had a string of religious friends in to pray over her. Not one of them are here now, including him - their prayers didn't work. Her children and grandchildren will take care of her in death while everyone who failed her in life has gone to pray.\n\nI fucking hate religion. She was super healthy and a fighter and might have lived 20 more years if she had just had that first outpatient surgery and radiation 8 years ago.\n\nEdited because... errors in spelling, etc",

A little bit like God has in a way.\n\nCertain powers given by the people to a superior authority such as the power of veto or the power to decide on the course of a war seem to me to closely resemble the way in which religions give enormous power to a \"superior\" entity in a sort of way. removal of responsibility for choices from an entity other than oneself.\n\nThe structures of our societies ultimately seem to strongly resemble the structures that religions have adopted and I wonder if the fact that these structures are present on a daily basis in our democratic spaces does not make religions still feel well legitimized in their actions and their existence because they correspond more or less to the structures that civil society possesses.\n\nIn the feeling of feeling normal, integrated and therefore legitimized, do religious organizations not take advantage of the fact that their structures are similar to that of civil society to reinforce this false impression of being in the right and that people who are freer in their thoughts and capable of critical thinking, less organized in structures, would therefore be more easily delegitimized in a sort of tribal reaction ?\n\n&#x200B;",

Like seriously - apocalyptic floods, people turning into salt, parting the sea, etc. it’s so weird how people believe this shit is POSSIBLE but it just hasn’t happened in the last couple thousand years. \n\nApparently god created the heavens and the earth thousands of years ago, yet we can directly observe light from a star that started its journey tens of billions of years ago. That’s a direct contradiction and one of those two things is backed by science. \n\nIf you went to the doctor or the hospital and they were practicing medicine as it was practiced 2000 years ago, you would sprint out of the building. Yet billions of people live their lives based on stories from a time when almost nobody could read or write. Seriously, 90% of people couldn’t even write their own name. That is mind boggling. You would never base your life on the rambling of toddlers in a day care, it’s literally that level of intelligence. \n\nPeople believe religion because adults beat it into their kids brains. Nobody wants to be stupid, so everyone else has to believe or it’s crazy. It only works if everyone pretends it’s true. People believe religion because the idea that we might die and that’s it isn’t very comforting. Religion was invented as a means to control people. It probably served a purpose thousands of years ago but it’s basically just a mass delusion. \n\nReligion is for morons that don’t posses the ability or desire to think critically\n\nReligion is a way for mediocre people to feel superior\n\nReligion is a means to justify your own shitty actions",

Growing up, I was taught that all glory and success should be attributed to God. While this may seem like a positive message, it had a negative impact on my self-esteem and mental health.\r  \nWhenever I achieved something, whether it was a good grade or a personal accomplishment, I was told to give all the glory to God. While I understand the intention behind this message, it made me feel like I was never good enough. I felt like I could never take credit for my own achievements because they were always attributed to God. On the other hand, whenever I failed or made a mistake, I felt like it was my fault because God can never fail. This led to a cycle of negative self-talk and severely low self-esteem.\r  \nAs a result, I struggled with depression for many years. I felt like I had no purpose or value because I could never take credit for my own accomplishments. It wasn't until I left Christianity that I was able to start healing and building my self-esteem.\r  \nI'm curious if anyone else has had a similar experience.

They insist that the lack of conclusive evidence means the only option is faith. Is the fact that we are here and living in the universe now not enough? Why can I not resign myself to “I don’t know, but I’m here” without being shoehorned into a faith-based belief system?\n\nIn my opinion, it’s thinly-veiled projection. The Christian will feel more comfortable with their uncertainty if they can convince themself that nonbelievers have faith too. \n\nI don’t think this is a productive conclusion.

Overall it would probably prompt more acceptance for differing views. \n\nWhile I definitely see the preferred arrangement for monotheistic organised religions to control and funnel money to one central sect rather than distributed over many, I am unclear why the population would prefer such a belief?\n\nMy own thoughts on this are that having a written text such as the Bible or Qur'an, etc. as opposed to  the transfer of stories via the spoken word allowed specific monotheistic religions to propagate widely despite language constraints.

  "selftext": "Okay this is kind of a dumb story from when I was like 7 when I first questioned religion specifically catholicism. So I was definitely very scared of God when I was a kid like, I wasn't exactly worried of doing bad things, I was more worried of doing \"bad things\" on accident.\n\nLike intrusive thoughts saying \"God is bad\" in your head or something lol, or just really anything that seemed like I didn't have much control. \n\nWhere I grew up quite a few people would \"swear to the holy bible\" which would only really be said in super serious scenarios, my parents never said that stuff just people around us. But I truly had been led to believe that if you lie when swearing to the holy bible, God will strike you down. This bothered me a lot because I didn't feel comfortable knowing one lie that no one is stopping you from saying could make you go to Hell if you swear \"to the holy bible\".\n\nSo one day, this doesn't seem related but it is, I had seen on TV I don't remember what show/movie but someone had been climbing through a vent, and I had no clue that vents could have enough space for people to fit so I grabbed a flashlight to look inside of a vent in the house I grew up in.\n\nThe vent was definitely too small to climb in, but after looking inside, without anybody around, I decided to say to myself out loud \"I swear to the holy bible that I have climbed in this vent\" I stayed unstricken by God, obviously.\n\nAfter this, it wasn't like I became an atheist overnight, but it definitely made me less scared at the time of God. I still had believed in him until a few years later, but I had stopped in believing a lot of what other people were telling me to be afraid of regarding God and the Bible. ",

I was the one usually getting upset but, there was no resentment or dislike toward her, just frustration as I felt like she wasn't putting in effort to address my concerns.\n\nI never hid my lack of faith in any religion but, she's one of those people that says they believe in god but don't know anything about the BIble, don't go to church, she literally said once \"You don't have to believe in the Bible 100% to be Christian.\" If the topic ever ends up centering around religion, she is very quick to shut it down because, I guess it makes her too uncomfortable to think about there not being a God for some reason.\n\nRecently, we got into a little spat about something super small and she used it as an opportunity to tell me she wanted to breakup. Citing that, among other things, \"God had saved [her] from many things including suicide and [I] know this\".\n\n........Turns out she had been cheating on me with some simp at work. She started a new position at her job just a month or two ago and after just a few days of texting (who knows how long they had been flirting at work), they've already met up and she let him play with her privates. They had been meeting up in the back of their store to kiss and rub on each other for a while before we were even fighting. She's been working with him for less than 75 days and they have already said \"I love you\".

In their minds, they were teaching me the most important things, and that is how they could justify it to themselves. \n\nThis may be a strong statement, and let me know if you disagree, but I now see it as a form of neglect.  I was a kid and I needed to be taught life skills and empathy and critical thinking and all those things I was never taught.  \n\nSo, one of the many issues with growing up with religion is that it takes the place of things that really matter.  If it wasn't for the internet and my own drive to educate myself, I would not be able to live as a stable and productive adult.\n\nI wish my country (USA) was more aware of the harms that religion causes, especially for developing children.",

I am white and male, and grew up in a conservative province of Canada even though the city was slightly less bad. I can point out the flaws I have with my own religion, but I can't speak (nor should I) on religions I don't know at all. My best friend is muslim and still loves me and supports me, but for some reason, an Israëli publication shows the few visibly muslim women in the protests and suddenly we go into unbelievable levels of orientalism, and pretend to have a knowledge of biopower not realising that Canada also has that issue. I point out Israëli as it seems funny that the dog whistle of hating on muslims would have been apparent to some people, yet I guess not.\n\nLook at the othering of foreign muslim people that you don't know by saying : \n\n>Let's move to this wonderful tolerant land that respects our human rights and where our children can have better lives. Where the freedoms and respect will ensure we can all flourish.  \nNow let's fuck it up and start insisting that human rights and respect are only for some people. Definitely for us because otherwise that would suck and feel unfair, but fuck those other guys that just want to lead normal loving productive lives without harming anyone.\n\nThis post got 1k upvotes, it is incredibly intolerant and you seem to forget that I have had more hate by the people from this country who were mostly Christian and had no problem treating me terribly. Yet I have had no bad interaction with muslim people coming from abroad.\n\nI knew that the weird focus on showing women with headdreasses and men with turbans (**sikhs** not muslim) was going to make it seem like the white Christian antiqueer people were in the background of some not so white, not so christian looking people protesting inclusive measures when the white christian premiers were the ones who put these pointless laws in place.\n\nI will never pretend that one religious group is better than another, but the idea of some foreign extremists coming to « raise *jihad* » on our country is far from reality. It's coming from our own country from white settlers who have issues with the mere concept of queerness. The likeliness of foreign violence subjugation has been a stupid xenophobic rhetoric that needs to stop as it shows how some white people have made this simple philosophy into a neonazi antiforeign mindset because coincidentally you try to blame it on others instead of realising that it's the culture that we all grew up in.\n\nTo be honest, it makes me ashamed to be an atheist when I can see such clear points of islamophobia within the mindset. Stop using antimuslim talking points to justify your xenophobia it's pathetic and you know that you know nothing about the religion and even if you did, it doesn't justify exporting our fears to problems that don't **actually** affect us to scale. I have driven past the protesters, it was whiter than mayonnaise.\n\nI will just finish off by saying that as a queer person, I will never want xenophobes, islamophobes, racists to stand up for me, I'd rather go it alone than to deal with pathetic white supremacists. We need to wake up and realise that Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens should not be idolised. One was apathetic to paedophilia because it didn't traumatise him and the other was a misogynist pretending that he knew why women aren't funny. Also, Darwin had sex with his cousin, so we need to stop idolising white men and forget that this was **always** meant to be inclusive or else we're no better than the religions we're free from !",

They hit us with \"We've never asked for anything else\", and I said I had to think about it. My gut reaction is to stand firm and refuse. I was baptized in a hospital due to complications and my mom had relayed that story to my MIL and FIL. They are now using that as a justification. \"It's only a little water\" is how they phrased it.

Next, much of what I'm about to post is either speculation, or relies on some esoteric Biblical scholarship. Finally, I'm an amateur at this. I'm hoping some of you who are better versed in these subjects might add to or correct things that I get wrong here.\n\nI've been reading a lot about Hellenistic influences on the early Christian stories. Specifically, the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The influence is great. Matthew is structured much like Greek Drama, and each of the gospels have different audiences. So that got me to thinking...\n\nMost of the common people, such as the new Jewish messianic cult of Christianity would attract, were illiterate in the Roman world. They didn't read at all. So with the cult gaining a bunch of illiterate members, why did they decide book form was the best method of acquainting people with the Jesus story? It's my conjecture that they didn't.\n\nInstead, I suspect the best way they would have come up with to tell that story is through theater. And the original document(s) upon which the three gospels were based were scripts written to tell the story in dramatic theatrical performances. So the script(s), and eventually the books, were more like bio-pics we make today than actual biographical histories. They were more like the movie Oppenheimer, than they would be a biography contemporary to Oppenheimer's life. I imagine the plays, like the Oppenheimer movie, selected only the most significant events in the subject's life, and then dramatized them to make them entertaining for their respective audiences. I suspect the person who inspired the Jesus character was as human as Oppenheimer, and that the plays, like the highly regarded movie, made him bigger than life.\n\n(One bit that many don't know is that John the Baptist was known independent of the Christian cult, as he was murdered by the wife of Herod, creating some scandal at the time. That he was worked into the story makes sense, since audiences of the area would already be familiar with him.)\n\nSpeaking of audiences, the story would have to be told differently to different audiences. Not coincidentally, Mark is thought to be aimed at Romans or (as I speculate again), Roman converts to the Christian cult. Matthew is aimed at Jewish converts. And Luke at gentiles or Greek converts. (I wouldn't be surprised if Paul was exposed to one of these theatrical presentations, long before the gospels were first put into book form.) \n\nThis is about where I've reached the end of my capacity to speak even somewhat competently about these things. What am I missing? What did I get right? Am I on to something, or can this idea be rejected outright? I'd love to learn more. ",

  "selftext": "The mystery of the how the Universe came to be has long been used to “prove” God’s existence.  Somehow theists assert it’s okay to have an uncreated God but not an uncreated Universe.  Yet really there is no mystery as to the how our universe came to be.  \r  \n\r  \n\n\n1. One consequence of quantum physics is that subatomic particles pop into existence all the time. No true vacuum can exist because if it did, it would be possible to know the position & velocity of every particle in it, there being none.  Quantum uncertainty makes this impossible, thus pairs of “virtual” particles (electron/positron, etc.) pop into existence.  In an instant, the two opposing particles with opposite and attracting charges collide and annihilate each other. \r  \n\n\n2. It is possible for one of these virtual particles to exist for a non-trivial amount of time, for example if its opposite gets sucked into a black hole or it annihilates a different anti-particle.  \r  \n\n\n3. Just after the Big Bang, the universe was the size of a subatomic particle.  For all intents and purposes, it WAS a subatomic particle, though of a type with which we can necessarily have no other experience, namely baby universes.  \r  \n\n\n4. If subatomic particles pop into existence and sometimes survive, and if universes begin as subatomic particles, then it’s possible universes pop into existence and survive.  Perhaps our universe and its anti-universe popped into existence, then the anti-universe annihilated a different universe leaving ours to expand and prosper.  \r  \n",

  "selftext": "I was reading a book about the history of the Bible to better educate myself about how it was a human artifact in the first place, and because life is far too short to ever want to read the Bible itself anyway.\n\nI came across a very interesting section. It explained that there have been different ways of interpreting the New Testament.  One approach focuses on the good works of Jesus and sees it as a guide for how to live a good life. This approach is closer to how Jewish people see the Old Testament, more as a guide for how to live in Israel as God‘s chosen people. It deemphasises the New Testament as a prophecy of the coming of a Messiah and, given Jesus was Jewish, is likely closer to how early Christians would have thought of the new Testament themselves while it was being assembled.\n\nAn alternative approach is to see the new Testament as a development of The Old Testament and in particular to focus not on Jesus’ good works (which are pretty much ignored), but rather on how Jesus was a promise for the redemption and salvation of people by belief in him. This reading emphasises the creation, fall and then redemption of humankind through Jesus. It also emphasises the more Gnostic thinking of the world being flawed and humans who do not believe in Jesus as being sinners on the road to hell. This approach was effectively encouraged by the Apostle Paul and came to overtake Christian thinking.\n\nThis alternative approach strikes me as being much more in line with the narcissism and self obsession which we see in many churchgoers, and in particular Evangelicals and Christian Nationalists.\n\nThese people love to see themselves as the chosen ones by God and the rest of us as lower class subjects to boss around. They also seem quite happy to ignore the teachings of Jesus as been too “Woke” and seems much more in line with the self centered narcissism that would be consistent with idolizing Trump.\n\nI’ve probably simplified a lot here but, this struck me as an insightful explanation of why Christians aren’t interested these days in allegedly Christian stuff like helping the poor, so I thought I would share this view point and invite a few comments.",

  "selftext": "I was raised Mormon. In Mormon theology, they believe that after the Second Coming of Jesus, everyone will be resurrected. In their Book of Mormon, [the book of Alma, chapter 40, verse 23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40?lang=eng&id=p23#p23):\n\n> 23. The soul shall be restored to the body and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.\n\nSo, riddle me this: how does this work if you are who you are because part of the larger circle of life, either via cremation or natural decay?\n\nThis was something that bugged me while I was Mormon. Suppose I die, get buried and sealed in my coffin and cement vault six feet under. At some point, the vault will crack, the wood of the coffin break down, and my body will start to become the food for other living organisms—worms, plant roots, etc.\n\nThose organisms might thrive and reproduce, passing my DNA on to multiple offspring, which might in turn reproduce further, continuing to spread my DNA. If a worm contains my DNA, and a bird eats that worm, it then has my DNA. That bird might pass my DNA through its feces, nourishing plants. Those plants are pollinated thanks to bees and consumed by cows. Some poor cow that now has part of my DNA is slaughtered and sold as steak, which some other human consumes.\n\nI mean, this is just one of a billion scenarios. The point being, I'm providing the nutrients for potentially billions of life forms which could in turn further benefit mankind. New humans are who they are because over the course of the circle of life, they ate some decaying human that passed some years earlier.\n\nSo now the resurrection hits, and not \"a hair of the head shall be lost\". But that hair only exists because of someone else, whose hair only existed because of someone else prior to them, all the way back to Adam and Eve.\n\nI can't possibly have every hair restored if it means taking proteins, amino acids, etc. from from previous humans due to the circle of life. We're who we are because we benefited from the living organisms that lived before us. Cells multiply and we reproduce, further multiplying those cells, all because we consumed some other living organism.\n\nSo really, the only person that can \"be restored to their proper and perfect frame\" is Adam, as Eve was made from Adam's rib. Adam can't be perfect without it.\n\nAm I missing something? If not, how does Mormonism, or Christianity in general explain this?\n\nEdit: typo",

The irony is that the issue was their enforced rules and sense of feeling socioeconomically trapped with no direction.\n\nThey left me on the streets claiming when I would reach out to them for help in my life I was \"selfish\" and \"mentally abusing\" them and \"bringing everybody down\" and literally every time I have talked with my dad or my siblings they bring up religion as a solution to everything insisting my problem is a lack of faith rather than a lack of social support system, material conditions, socioeconomic stability, and despondency around career and relationships. In essence, my humanity was being treated as a disease to be cured rather than a value to be cultivated, with needs to be medicalized or prayed away.\n\nI think that what was disturbing to me is the double bind I was in. On one hand I was under the control of parents at a time where over half my generation was living with parents, with an unstable job market and unprecedented living costs, but then on the other to describe my alienation and difficulties deconstructing without any social support system and especially in dating and sexuality I was put in with the Incel crowd and stigmatized further and told I needed to \"work on myself\" (self help) or directed back to the mental health industry for solutions which sold me cures to my own humanity and clever distractions rather than tangible solutions.\n\nAs a guy it felt like I had no idea who to trust at all and stigmatized from both sides in this. In the end the family disowned me and left me on the streets. I have not met anybody more passive aggressive than my mother who claimed it \"broke her heart\" to see me homeless so much she \"had no choice\" but to disown me because she couldn't handle seeing it (weird logic)? Dad claims he resents and is jealous of homeless people who need to \"get a job.\" I was told to work at chipotle while living in my car",

If there were 2 original humans, that means their children were all siblings, and in order to reproduce their children would have to inbreed. \n\nIt’s common knowledge that inbreeding comes with a vast amount of genetic issues. Physical deformities, very weak immune systems, and significantly higher mortality rates. As more generations inbreed, the higher the defects. This means that by 3 or 4 generations, the human race would have died off due to massive death counts from the accumulated deficiencies and mutations. It’s impossible to have grown a healthy species of 8 billion plus inhabitants from 2 ancestors.\n\nThis also opens a variety of other plotholes in the Bible. Adam and Eve created the original sin, the one which Jesus supposedly died for. Now that they’re proven to be fake, this means there was no original sin for Jesus to have died. This also means that the entire Saga about Jesus on Earth is fake as well, as it’s based entirely on Jesus dying for the Sin. Thus, more than half of the Bible is instantly proven inaccurate \n\ntl;dr: Humanity can’t have come from 2 humans because it would have been wiped out by the negative affects of inbreeding. This also proves the whole concept of the original sin of Adam and Eve wrong",

A question is not an answer. \n\nAnd all of it is because of severe lack of understanding of fallacies etc \n\nFor example, Jesus rising from the dead is not evidence of his god hood  \"but surely he's not crazy enough to die for his convictions\". we have no way to prove whether he did or did not have mental illness. And whether he did or did not is irrelevant. Simply show the evidence how his actions no matter how amazing, shows he is god. \n\nOr they might talk about purpose. Like supposedly rocks have purpose. Purpose only can come into play if there exist a need or desire.\n\nAnd so on... Its definitely exhausting and kind of makes me sad that these people, in some part are still children. But these overgrown children sometimes wage wars. \n\nThe basic idea that a drawing of a historical and very dead desert dweller really isn't gonna hurt you is a basic idea that some how slips their mind. of course they think god will send a lightning down on them for allowing such a thing. \n\nBut all these fallacies sometimes makes me lose hope in humanity",

  "selftext": "I don't even know where to begin but I need to vent about an incident that occurred over my family chat (brother, SIL, sister, parents, wife) recently. What happened is not the first occurrence and the language used gets harsher and harsher each time it happens.\n\nFor context I was raised in the Catholic school system from kindergarten to senior year of high school. My grandparents are very Catholic -- whish is great, they're incredible people -- but my parents kinda fell out of the faith and so while I went to Catholic school I never identified as a Catholic.  I wouldn't necessarily call myself an ashiest, or agnostic, or really anything other then \"eh, don't really care.\" I also lean left politically though compared to most of Reddit I'm probably closer to the middle. My religious and political ideologies are basically \"I don't really give a fuck, whatever makes you happy, just don't force your beliefs on me.\"\n\nThis is also the political ideology of my wife, though she is a bit more vocally opinionated on things that directly impact her, such as women's health. We also have a toddler daughter and so my is doubly vocally opinionated because she carries the weight of my daughters rights as well.\n\nOur parenting philosophy very much follows our political and religious philosophy: you can believe whatever you want as long as you're being respectful to those around you. We encourage emotional expression and communication and we don't reprimand our daugther when she says \"mean\" things as long as she describes how shes feeling and why she feels that way. In other words, we try our hardest to demonstrate open dialogue, respectful discussion, and fact finding.\n\nMy brother grew up very much like me except in adulthood he rejoined the Catholic faith and has doubled, tripled, and quadrupled down on his belief. He married a very religious  woman and they are raising their daugthers in very religious ways. I have my own opinions about this, but it's not my family or my life so I keep them to myself. Largely though, I couldn't give two shits.\n\nHowever my brother has always had this attitude of superiority. He's always believed he was the smartest in the family. My entire family has bachelors degrees except for him and his wife. His wife has a doctorate and he is finishing up a masters. I don't know if this is a core personality trait of his, or if this is a true belief, but I think he believes they are more educated on every topic because of their advanced degrees. Mind you, the rest of my family is no slouch. We all have our accolades and are all objectively successful; on some metrics we are more successful than they are.\n\nMy brother like's to bring up the topic of religion and politics in our group chat. They are avid pro-gun advocates (we are very much not) and they are avid pro-life advocates (we are very much not). These are topics that should be avoided but during events (school shootings, legislature, etc.) he will post some long-winded diatribe about how abortion is killing babies or how access to guns isn't an issue and how he connects his beliefs to his Catholic faith.\n\nNormally, my wife and I will roll our eyes and let it go. However, sometimes he instigates fights by saying shit like:\n\n> I can't wait until we're done calling abortion a \"right.\" Reminds me of \"slave owners rights.\" Nobody has a \"right\" to kill someone or own them.\n\n> We can only logically arrive at abortion if we first admit it's okay to kill another human.\n\nI respond by saying something along the lines of:\n\n> We've decided as society that it's okay to terminate life, what's not okay is terminating a person's life. So to equate abortion to killing a person you must first establish that what you \"killed\" is 1) alive and 2) has personhood.\n\nI'm paraphrasing a longer text, but it's pretty respectful and demonstrates my point of view which he attacked earlier by insinuating my belief is illogical. He then goes on to being straight-up disrespectful by saying:\n\n> This isn't rocket science and it's no philosophy\n\n> You're idea about life is like Flat Earth level wrong\n\n> You're demonstrating profound cognitive dissonance\n\n> You have an insane position but whatever fits your political views\n\n> Literally nobody with intellectual honesty and the ability to read can say this\n\nI then go on to say that he's being insanely disrespectful, that his comments are derogatory, etc. His response is:\n\n> It's impossible to have a conversation with someone who refuses to recognize established observable realities.\n\n> Can you read?\n\nThis all devolves into people leaving the chat and just generally causing drama. Again, this isn't the first time this has happened. The last time it happened he started stirring the pot about gun control during a recent mass shooting (can't remember which). My wife got involved, some heated words were exchanged, and his wife left the chat and my wife and I were forced to apologize.\n\nThe thing that sucks here is that because they are the \"odd ones out\" it's somehow acceptable for them to shit on everyone's political and religious opinions but none of us can because Catholics are \"historically persecuted.\" Any suggestion that their beliefs are just as \"crazy\" and influenced by external factors (i.e. religion) as everyone elses is met with great offense.\n\nIt's getting to the point where my wife is outright saying \"I don't like your brother and I don't know if I want him talking to our child our around our child like that.\" He is argumentative, derogatory, disrespectful, and unwilling to engage in civil discourse -- these are all foundational tenants in how my wife and I raise our children. My parent's are afraid that the relationship with my brother will sour, but honestly they should be more worried about the already soured relationship he has with my wife.\n\nThis whole thing sucks. Religion is a crazy drug. Thank you for coming to my TED talk.",

  "selftext": "Looking to crowdsource some answers to help in a debate with my husband. I grew up in a pretty small community that was very devote to a specific type of religion. I’m no longer a part of that belief system, but every so often I’ll say something about my childhood that seems completely normal to me and he’ll be dumbfounded by it. I still don’t feel like any of these things are that insane, but I’m hoping the internet can give me a pulse check to see how weird these are. Below are the top three he has been blown away by:\n\n1. Our community did the same celebrations for Halloween each year. Starting at about middle school and up through adulthood, we would go to a theatre-like setting, normally within a church, to watch a dramatic performance. Small bits would change each year, but it would always end in the same way; the cast members would slowly separate out groups so that basically everyone was standing with about 2 feet in between them and the next closest person, then they would introduce satan’s character, and he would go person to person basically trying to creep you out or scare you. Lots of people would cry. Then, after the alter call for the performance, we’d all go back to our church to “sacrifice.” They would get a bonfire going and pretty much from grade school up, we’d go around the group and throw our “idols” into the fire. People would bring everything from adult magazines to toys that would make a kid disobey their parents. After everyone had sacrificed their idols, we’d roast s’more and chill till it was time to go home. \n\n2. During February, ages 12-20 would spend the entire month talking about love and modesty. During the month they would split classes into separate groups for boys and girls. At the end of the month, they would create a “contract,” from memory is was like 2 pages, saying that we committed to abiding by the teachings of modesty and purity. The children that did sign this (basically everyone) were then “honored” on stage during the next service and their parents would come up and sign the contract as well, committing that they would keep these rules in their home. \n\n3. We would have prayer meetings about once a month. They were generally lead by a women that was considered to be our spiritual warrior. She would frequently prophesy during these meetings, everything from “you will be delivered” to “the end times are near.” One that happened very often though was the amount of prophesies about who would marry who. I was told for about 7 years I’d marry another guy in the church (let’s call him Levi). Levi and I were really good friends, hung out all the time, and even hooked up once or twice (clearly breaking the purity rule 😂) but we never dated or were in the vein of marriage material. These prophetic stances would happened to several people. She’d stand in front of the group, say she was getting a word and share that it had been revealed these two people were destined for each other. Then everyone would kind of push those two people together and pray for their future marriage. Some people did end up getting married and some didn’t. \n\nOk Reddit; how weird are these to you?",

To be honest, my family was never particularly religious -- we just celebrated holidays and sometimes prayed together as a family. Everyone's fine with my beliefs, and I suppose I'm quite lucky this way.\n\nRecently, though, as cliche as it may sound, I've been thinking about the meaning of life. The rationalist in me believes that human are just like other animals; we mate, propagate our species, and then die. But I don't want this to be true.\n\nIt would be so lovely if there was a greater purpose to my existence. I would love for there to be something more. Perhaps it's the human supremisist within me but I want my life to have more inherent worth than that of a worm.\n\nI can't get myself to believe in any of the miracle stuff that comes with religion. Neither can I excuse the horrors that are continually committed in the name of religion. I can't get myself to believe in an afterlife, but I keep thinking how wonderful a just afterlife would be. Not one where homosexuals go to hell, of course, but where good, moral people are rewarded with something.\n\nMy brain keeps telling me it's not true, but I keep wishing it was. I envy those who go about their lives believing in some greater purpose. I've begun to pity myself, like how I would pity a child who grew up without Father Christmas, the Tooth Fairy, or fairy stories. Yes, they're lies, but they're such beautiful lies, and they make life so much more fun and fulfilling.\n\nAnyone else sometimes feel like this?\n\nUpdate: I've very much enjoyed reading the replies. Thank you to everyone for sharing your thoughts. I suppose I'm not as hostile towards religion as perhaps I should be. I was raised in a very liberally religious way (\"We only believe the good parts of religion\"), so I suppose the solace I imagine I'd find in religion is exaggerated. I've also noticed that I naturally feel a bit down each year during the winter months, so perhaps my thoughts were a reflection of this. But I have now changed my mind, largely due to the reply of u/bin_unladen that the goal of propagating our species doesn't stop at reproduction; it also involves making a better, safer, and more free world for posterity. I think there is profound meaning that can be found through this perspective. Thank you again everyone for your replies!",

Can god not tell that the animals on noahs ark isnt you just adding details to the ark? I think god can understand that the religious depictions of places in the Quran isnt you worshipping the denizens of that religious place from the book god comes from.\n\nSrry for the pointless rant, im just baffled by this.

As her executor, I ensured everything was done to her wishes. This included all Christian services. \nBefore she passed, she was in an assisted living facility. About three weeks after her passing, the facility held a ceremony to remember her and another resident who passed away.  The ceremony was held in their Christian chapel.\nI attended along with my daughter (atheist) and my parents (devout Christians). I wanted to attend because I feel that any promotion of her memory or celebration of her life is important. I loved her very much.\nSo fast forward to this evening. My wife thinks it's ok that I'm an atheist, but she thinks that I'm supposed to bow my head and close my eyes at a Christian ceremony out of respect when they engage in prayer. She thinks that when I stay open eyed even looking around that this is disrespectful - like I'm purposely being an asshole because I don't believe.\nI couldn't disagree more. Honestly, where's the respect for what I believe? Why do I have to bow my head and close my eyes to somehow be respectful? I'm so tired of this. I don't think that by not subscribing to religious behavior means that I'm being disrespectful. I sat through dinner with friends tonight listening to my friend's girlfriend go on and on about her spiritual journey with crystals. I think it's complete bullshit, but if it makes her happy, I'm happy for her. Why can't I get the same respect? Why do I have to feel uncomfortable if I bring up my volunteer activities with my humanist group? I'm so tired of this.",

  "selftext": "A few days ago at my retail job a co-worker who I was sort of close with told me that she is leaving work in a few days. I asked her why and what plans she had after. She legit asked me if I knew Jesus. At first I was like yeah but then she asked me how. For a moment I thought I messed up and we had a co-worker named Jesús or maybe she had a famliy member named that. Then I asked if she meant the one from the bible. She said yes and things got stranger from there. She claimed that the rapture was coming and that she was leaving work to spend more time with Jesus. (Didn't even mention spending time with her family.)\n\n She then went on to say that the most recent earthquakes were a sign and the war on the holy land? Yeah I was legit baffled when this came out of no where. I had seen her wear a cross necklace before but I had no Idea she was this into it. I then got told about how the devil was trying to trick people or something like that.\n\n Next was the topic about LGBTQA+. She said that people were choosing a path of wrong doing and sin. This hurt me because I'm a part of the community. I simply pretended that I didn't know what being gay was lol. \n\nwhen covid shots were her next topic I mentally cringed. A famliy member of mine is a conspiracy nut so I know all about what people like them think. She liked the fact that I never got the shot, due to my parents involvement. During this whole conversation that lasted 40 minutes I only nodded my head and told her what she wanted to hear. (I normally pretend to be Christian at my work to avoid conflicts and drama).\n\n I learned that her mom passed last month. This may be stress related. I hope she uses this time away from work to properly grieve and heal. I wish the best for her. \n\nThank you for reading",

  "title": "What is your response to A) atheism being a world view, and B) it being a claim. More context below..",
  "selftext": "I am an atheist, Im looking to get answers to two particular aspects surrounding atheism and would value your perspectives.\n\nA) Regarding atheism as a worldview: It’s often said by theists that atheism involves viewing the world without the influence or existence of a deity. To me I don't see the issue with this, as I don’t see the world through a god-centric lens. However, I’ve noticed that many atheists actively dispute this idea. What are the reasons behind this disagreement? Why might some atheists not consider their atheism as part of their worldview? Is it not a worldview to see the world without a deity being involved?\n\nB) On atheism being a claim: There’s a common notion in atheistic circles that ‘God does not exist’ is not a claim, but rather a lack of belief. This distinction is weird to me, because i agree its the lack of belief, but it can kind of be a claim, no? When we assert ‘God is not real,’ isn’t that in itself a claim? I understand that atheism is primarily the absence of belief in gods, but this assertion seems to be more than just a lack of belief. It feels contradictory when we, as atheists, insist that God doesn’t exist, yet also state that we don’t make claims about the existence of one. Of course i guess you'd have to define God here, because I certainly don't believe in the abrahamic one.\n\nIn my own approach, I lay out the rationale behind my disbelief before reaching a conclusion. However, if one asserts the non-existence of God and backs it with evidence, does it then become more than just a claim, perhaps a substantiated viewpoint? Similarly, does this reasoning apply to theists who present evidence for their beliefs, regardless of the strength of their evidence? Is it then not a claim?\n\nI’m reflecting on whether there’s a misconception in my understanding and would greatly appreciate your insights on these two aspects of atheism.",

  "selftext": "I grew up in a religious family (Jehovah's Witnesses). I was often told that demons and angels exist.\n\nAs an adult, I wondered. Let's imagine a situation:\n\nAngels are imperfect and can do what they want (in the Bible, for example, they descended to earth before the Flood). So they have freedom of choice.\n\nSuppose there is one naughty, very stupid angel in heaven (or in Satan's lair). He breaks the most important rule of all imaginary beings (not to appear in public). The angel flies to New York to Time Square and starts to show all sorts of magic tricks. All this is caught by security cameras and passersby. We take the angel to a lab and test and prove the existence of the supernatural.  Done! That's proof that angels exist. But it doesn't happen in real life.\n\nI came to a conclusion: **If angels and demons exist, why aren't there any cases of them appearing in public?** There must be at least one naughty very stupid angel who shows up in public. But where are they? Why do I only find fake videos on the Internet? Maybe magical creatures just don't exist. That's a much more logical answer than making up excuses all the time.\n\nA common response from believers is that God has forbidden angels to appear in public on purpose. Then the question is: **Why did angels stop appearing in public just as scientific progress began? Coincidence?**",

I'm hearing a lot more \"Jesus will provide\" when we discuss finances, even though Jesus never changes our finances.

  "selftext": "This post is practically me venting the piss i fell while reading some Christian site stuff, i hope i'm not stepping over the rules. \nFor a little bit of context, i was scrolling on Google about the Disney movie \"Brother Bear\" because i was interested in the culture surrounding the movie. While i was doing this, i got to this site called \"Movieguide\"\nI was going to put the links but the last time I think the bot erased this so, there's the site's name. \nBut lets continue. \nI was curious about this, and oh surprise, as soon as got into the cite i got catholic school backgroung, right know i'm myself an agnostic/atheist, something in the middle ground, however this kind of stuff gave me terrible problems and panic attacks while i was a child/teenager. \nBut well, less continue. \"Intentional blasphemy, evil, gross immorality, and/or worldview problems, to be avoided\" sings the page. \nWhat did a bear a movie about bears and letting the love change you did to the christians? Portray love and afterlife in a \"blasphemous\" way that offends god because it goes against \"his word\". But it's not surprise when we are talking about the worldview of people that believe love is creating a place full of pain and judging people based on their beliefs is fair, blaming people for not believing when their source of faith is violent and terrible itself. \nBut lets continue about this, I then searched the movie \"The Prince of Egypt\" i think that every person that has been raised catholic or christian knows this movie. \nThis movie, as expected, is praised by the author of the site because it \"portrays god as the hero he is\". Lol no. From my personal point of view, Exodus 14:4 was one of the quotes that made me change my mind when i was still catholic or at least, terribly fearful that god would damn me for thinking another way, but here is the quote in question. \n\"And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and he will pursue them. But I will gain glory for myself through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord..\"\nSo no, god wasn't the hero in this story, in fact, he could have spare non sense bloodshed and suffering according to the bibleand he did not because he needed everyone to look how powerful he was. \n\nIn fact, this post is a short 'essay' or i don't really know how to call it about me, an agnostic/atheist, who still deals with the religious trauma and OCD this kind of indoctrination and \"guidance\" left, besides, i'm wondering how this, in plain 2024 could still be a thing. Am I angry at the catholic faith for all those years i feared god would punish for watching a movie or series? Yes. But i'm as well concerned because it's just one version of the problems organized religion and indoctrination can cause to people, i'm sure almost every if not every religion has it's own example of this kind of stuff. I will say here another thing I keep repeating to myself and to other people, religion is not for children, stop pushing your stuff on them, because you would only get them to suffer and be afraid.",

  "selftext": "The fact that I am an atheist made me believe that the afterlife does not exist. I know it seems logical, but it's important for the rest. I believe that when you die, there are no thoughts, no feelings, no nothing. Which for a lot of people seem impossible and absolutely scary, but not for me. \n\nEmptiness for eternity is a belief that I live by.  You know what? I think that the idea of an afterlife scares me more than the idea of nothingness. Paradise, hapiness forever? But can happiness exist without sadness? I do not want to have something perfect forever, I think it would make me, not really be me. The paradise, christian paradise, the bundle concept of eternal hapiness. However, wouldn't you have to have some kind of mind control on yourself for that to exist? You would have to forget those who haven't made it. You friends and family, that haven't been good enough. If you didn't, you would be sad, which would be paradoxical in Heaven. You would scrap the mood of those around you. So you can't remember them.\n\nHell, torture forever, no thank you. No more thoughts about it.\n\nReincarnation: Do you really want to start everything over again? All of the boredom of life, childhood, school, all of them. Without memories? Would it even be you? I mean, memories are what make of a human what they are. Memories shape you into what you are. Your traumas, your education, and experiences are what make you a person. If you hadn't been raised by the parents that you have, haven't been friends with \"those' people, would you be there today? The response is probably: no. At least I would not. So would you be you if you started everything over again? No afterlife seems correct.\n\nThen, there is the concept of forever. Forever? Forever is a hard concept to grasp for a human being's mind. 80 years is the average lifespan. Yet, it feels long. I am at 17 years into it, and I know that it feels long. But eternity.  It is scary. No human can fully imagine what it is like. Centuries, millennium, million of years! In Hell or paradise. It seems... horrible! \n\nAlso, I believe that the fact that our mortal life is doom to end is what makes it so meaningful.  It's because there is an end to it that you make the best of it. If you thought that it would last forever, it would become boredom. Why would you do something when you have eternity? Why would you bother when you have all the time in the world for it? It's like the concept of procrastination in some sense. It would become a litteral cycle of undying. \"I would do it later.\" Nothing would be accomplished forever. An afterlife would be scary because of its inevitable routine. Nothing would make sense.\n\nTo wrap everything up, that's kind of the meaning of the Ying and the Yang for the Chinese. The concept of dualism, the belief that the force of the universe is opposing themselves. It's like two pieces of the same coin.The bad and the good. The night and the day. The sadness and the happiness. They are all a part of a whole. They can not exist without each other. They balance each other. Humans want only the good part, the day, the light, and the happiness.  They want to leave behind the bad part, the night, the darkness, and the sadness. Without seeing that without the bad, you can not have happiness.  If there were only hapiness, you would have nothing to compare it. You would not understand what is even happiness. It would become a dull feeling. It's like when you are so much in a situation that you see no endpoint because you don't know life without it. \n\nSo this is why I am an atheist. The concept of forever and afterlife do not make sense to me. If someone agrees with me, manifest yourself, please!",

  "selftext": "One of the things that I had often thought about when I was a Christian was how absurd some of these theological concepts were because they could have easy technological solutions. Can a human not look directly at god and survive? Why not? Couldn’t god create some god glasses that could filter out the lethal aspects of the projected light source? Could god not be in the presence of sin? What about sin makes it incapable of being around this god? Why couldn’t god stand behind a sin shield so anyone could stand in from of him, the shield could stop any effects of sin or god’s lethal gaze from being lethal, you could stand a short distance from this god and be perfectly fine. BTW-Is sin some sort of source of power or is it a disobedient act that only humans that can understand a god concept and it’s rules do? The bible asserts both concepts of sin can be valid.\n\n  \nThis also extends to the problem of evil, if god created a large O’Neal space colony, it would have perfect weather all year long, no earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods or storms. This god could easily solve the issue of natural disasters by creating a large O’Neal cylinder or several smaller O’Neal cylinders to house large populations. This is what us mere humans would do, so why can’t god do something that human engineers would do?\n\n  \nThis highlights the fact that if this god can’t do something, then it’s an admission that this god is very limited in power, this god can’t even create simple engineering solutions for these odd lethal powers that he can’t even modulate himself.\n\n  \nThere are biblical stories of technological solutions to negate the effects of god’s wrath, Noah’s ark mitigated the flood that god causes. The ark of the covenant was carried by a cart and had handles so you could transport it without touching the central container which could kill you. \n\nIt’s a really peculiar thing in the bible when simple technological solutions can mitigate god’s power or this god refuses to implement simple technological solutions to solve simple problems. It certainly makes these biblical stories seem silly, any reasonable person; including Christians, can’t help but question such absurdities.\n\n  \nAs an avid, sci-fi and fantasy fan I couldn’t help but see these tropes and realize they are utilizing these classic MacGuffins to drive a story along. The Raiders of the Lost Ark uses the Ark of The Covenant itself as a MacGuffin, but it’s only mirroring biblical stories that made up this MacGuffin in the first place! Seeing the parallels in modern fiction to those of biblical stories, it can become difficult to rationalize that Raiders of The Lost Ark is total fiction- but what about the original source for Raider’s fictional story?  \n",

If someone asks me my reason of being atheist, I just enquire them about their reason for being religious. Their most boring reason is the family faith...This is the main problem. They don't know what they are believing in and just follow it because some old religious millenniels told them to stick their head into their ass and pray like mindless chickens. This whole religion thing is so manipulative that a person may lose his sanity but the society will tell him to believe in worshipping a million gods/godesses or a single entity for nothing. We can follow the same lifestyle we are having now without following this crap mindset. Now many people will tell me somethings wrong with me and I am targetting specific religion but NO...I have seen people who are living miserably praying to god that their life will change instead of working hard. And one more thing....religion is very manipulative, if a politician says something about a particular religion the other feels attacked and stires up some controversial drama and the high class keep wrecking the minds of religious fools with this negative picture about each other beliefs who fight against themselves resulting in blood bath(iykuk). And if any almighty is so powerful that he has decided/decides everything that has occured/is happening/will happen in future, that means that every bad thing is because of it and not the people. I believe that everything we are doing is a religion itself. We are a part of the supreme human race and should do our part and just die....why do things like religion and racism/caste discrimination stuff that does not make sense when we are gone. Basically all the bad stuff have their links with religion and it interferes with every decision we make in our life. We can do much more for ourselves and our fellow people by not indulging in such activities. At the end, I say follow your heart, do things that make you happy, make the world a better place for others and realise you don't have the obligation to do everythings that society wants you. A man with without a religion is not absent minded, a man without his own belief is. (No hate to any community)",

  "selftext": "I used to live in a house in which everything you said inside, could be heard outside of the house, specially in the front of the house in the sidewalk (this was because of the arrangement of the inside of the house (the living room was exactly by the doorway next to the garage (which is small in my town; I live in Latin America, so the houses may be different from your country), and also, the living room is kinda like a dining room where the family eats together), and when I had arguments with my parents, everything could be heard outside, of course, I had arguments about religion which I still have to this very day. But the point is, my neighbor and his friends used to trash talk about me, and I could hear that when I was studying in the dining table during quarantine. My parents said it was schizophrenia when I, myself, saw them insulting me in my face (and I couldn't reply back because this usually happens when I am talking to somebody in public and I cannot distract myself from the conversation that I am having with somebody who is actually important to me, and also, giving them attention is not going to do things better for me). But you may say, what does everything here has to do with religion or atheism? Well, as I explained before, my neighbor heard me having an argument with my parents about me coming out as an atheist, and I could hear him outside saying in a mocking way \"awww, he doesn't believe in God\".\n\nSo, I am always thinking about how christians are just a bunch of hypocrites, because, their religion (as far as I read, because if I am going to be an atheist at least I should be knowledgable about the religion I left (I am talking for myself, everybody can have a diferent mindset)), is about fraternity (if you google that, one definition is \"the state or feeling of friendship and mutual support within a group.\") this is said in Corinthians kinda like that. And these christians bully others, trash talk others, steal, do not pay back their debts, their grandmothers do witchcraft, and they still say that they believe in God.\n\nI used to be very religious, but if a God allows that, to somebody who used to pray every night and every day, I am saying that God is just non-existent, and if he is existent, he is not all-mighty, and if he is all-mighty, he is evil, and if he is not evil, he is just plain useless, he literary is one of the very capital sins, \"pride\", because people always have to be praising him instead of the humans that actually do stuff on Earth, that are actual matter, the surgeons and medics that cure diseases, the engineers that build our houses, roads and computers, that friend that gives you emotional support when you need it the most. But christians say that all this pain is to make you stronger (tell that to war veterans that have no limbs or that have PTSD, they became weaker because of that shit), or they say you suffer hear, but you don't suffer there (in heaven), and I am saying that that's bullshit as well, because it is more likely to reincarnate than to go to heaven or hell (probably, this very earth is that, you live in hell if you live in a poor or dangerous place, or you live in heaven if you live in a safe and wealthy place).\n\nAnyways, sorry for this bible-lengthy post, but I really needed to get this out of my chest to a group of like-minded strangers online.\n\nEdit: My country is mostly catholic, and even though we make a distinction between christians and catholics, I am including catholics when I talk about christians in this post.",

This past week has left me with a lot of thoughts and contemplation about what happens after death and I have been making myself physically sick thinking about it.\n\nI have never been religious. Not enough evidence for me to blindly follow a book someone wrote 2000 years ago etc.\n\nI have been having trouble grappling the concept of an eternity of nothingness after my brain finally switches off and I die. The more I try to come to terms with that fact because I don't believe in god or a life after death, then the more and more sick I seem to make myself feel. I also seem to be making myself terrified at this thought.\n\nA friend made me a little better when he quoted Einstein in that no matter or energy is lost, it is simply transformed. This brought me some slight comfort as he is right, and the matter within my body will decompose or be burned and become something else. However it can't explain where my consciousness goes.\n\nMy consciousness is what makes me who I am and being a self-aware human being. It is hard to imagine it simply not existing again and that what i am as a consciousness is simply a blip in eternity.  Honestly I am making myself ill over this! I guess its my brain trying to understand and make sense of what has happened to my grandfather.\n\nI have slight envy for people who do believe in god in some way shape or form as no doubt it brings them great comfort and they don't end up trying to conceptualise nothingness like I am currently doing.\n\nIt doesn't stop me thinking they are wrong for the blind faith they have but if i thought like they do then I wouldn't be making myself feel sick like I currently am.\n\nI would love to be absolutely proven wrong, and their to be a heaven or something like that where I can picture my consciousness and existence living on in some form but because there is zero evidence to give me even the slightest bit of belief in it then I will always be atheist.\n\nHas anyone else grappled with thinking or imagining what becomes of our consciousness after death?

They're praying for lgbt and anyone who wants to abolish messed up tradition.\n\nThe problem is that a prayer, which is supposed to be a personal \"conversation\" with \"god\", is turned into manipulation by people who don't understand what a terrible movement this is. Poland is a perfect example. \n\nThe way they try to make women look crazy is inhumane and it deeply hurts me how people feed into this religious propaganda. This behaviour affects how women are treated in my country, verbally and physically and they're normalizing it everyday.\n\nReligious manipulations are easily involved in politics. This way, they collect cheap points, and if the organizers of that meeting establish a party, they already have a voting body. \n\nI don't care if you pray in public, i will walk past by you but i have other reasons why i can't stand it.

Some people are fighting for their rights, while others want to take them away. \n\nGay people do it for themselves, these people do it because they want to \"save\" women who don't want to be locked in the house and birth babies. \n\nImagine praying for women who want rights to make their own choices in a country where they already get hurt on the daily. It's actually so hostile and insane that they think women who don't obey their rules need mental help. It sounds like a fucking nightmare. Fuck me for not wanting to birth you a child and fuck me for wanting to stay alive.\n\nThese rules are implying that men have the right to do whatever with our bodies which can mean a lot of things and most people do take it as \"it's always her fault\" because they want to do whatever they want with our bodies with no consequences.\n\nSomeone on here said that anti abortion laws are pro rapist and i totally agree with that person.

  "selftext": "I'm honestly a bit surprised that I see so many fellow atheists spreading hate for Palestinians because they are Muslims. I understand that many of us have religious trauma, but to hate someone on the basis of religion is pretty antithetical to the point of our own values. We wouldn't want a religious person to hate us for being atheists. So why are there so many atheists doing this exact same thing but towards Palestinian Muslims? Not even all Palestinians are Muslims. That's a common misconception. There are plenty Palestinians with different faiths, and even Palestinian atheists too.\n\nI've seen so many people say \"Islam is the worst of the religions because the Qur'an is despicable and calls for the most outrages things\" meanwhile that's all of the Abrahamic religious books. The Qur'an is not uniquely ridiculous. In fact, the average religious person in the world doesn't even follow most of their religious texts literally or fully. Thankfully, right? So why is everyone pretending like Islam is the absolute worst of the bunch, and that Palestine deserves all of the war crimes, bombings, ethnic cleansing, displacement, and genocide thrown against them for the past 75 years??\n\nI fear that this recent development in the war is giving people an excuse to be Islamaphobic. While these same people completely ignore how Israel was even founded in the first place, and the atrocities they have been committing for the past 75 years. But sure, blame it all on the Muslims and the Palestinians who are literally fighting for their lives. Come on, y'all. We can do better than this. We don't have to like religion, we don't have to follow or believe in it. But allow others to do so if they wish. (Including obligatory \"as long as it doesn't cause harm on others\" clause here)",

  "selftext": "I’m creating a separate post for this after losing brain cells trying to respond to comments in the post made about Israel-Palestine.\n\nOne of my parents is Jewish and the other is Muslim. We grew up pretty secular but this week has still been pretty fucking hard. I definitely identify as an atheist but I’ve seen the good that religion can do for individuals and the absolute devastation it can wreak as an institution. Religions are particularly bad for *enshrining* inequality as some sort of divinely determined inevitability. Sure it’s inevitable but my secularism has personally allowed me to continually challenge it whereas religion fuelled a sort of complacency about it.\n\nNow back to the topic of geopolitics. There’s a lot of people in this sub talking about how all religious fundamentalists are pretty bad but that, for some reason, Islamic fundamentalists are ESPECIALLY bad, especially over the past few decades. This MUST be because Islam is inherently a dangerous religion, right? Wrong. Literally all the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam & Judaism) share many more similarities than they do differences but they’ll never admit that because of the human need for exceptionalism. It’s the institutionalizations of religion more than religion itself that poses great threats and the institutionalization of religion is rooted in geopolitics.\n\nThe reason Islamic fundamentalists stand out has to do with the end of US isolationism and the beginning of its interventionist foreign policy in the mid 20th century following WW2 [which saw the US conduct more military interventions in the Middle East than any other region in the world](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/america-intervene-middle-east-iraq/605299/) (!!!). This shift in approach can be largely attributed to Cold War rivalries. In 1950, the US State Department called the Arabian peninsula “the greatest material prize in world history” and a “stupendous source of strategic power”. Henry Kissinger once said that “to control nations, you must control oil”. Thus ensued the use of every military, economic, diplomatic and soft power tool at the US’ disposal to shape the region according to their needs. The extremism we see in Iran today is a modern relic. Iran was quite secular prior to the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran which saw the overthrowing of the monarchical government under Mohammed Reza Pahlavi with the theocratic government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini — a regime change that the US was actively involved in to secure their own interests in the region. There’s so much more fucking around that happened (including the US training the fucking Taliban) in the lead up to the 9/11 and the establishment of “radical Islam” as an existential threat to the U.S. values. The reality was that its own values (especially re: military invasion) were the root of its existential threats.\n\nSecular values will not protect us if they are coupled with capitalist values and ideals that will stop at NOTHING and exploit EVERYTHING to feed itself. \n\nEvery religion is capable of genocide because every religion is made up of humans that are capable of immense evil. Being the victim of genocide also doesn’t disqualify us from being capable of carrying it out. Open up your damn minds because being atheist doesn’t disqualify you from being a fucking bigot.",

I won’t share family details, but they all converted from a pretty insane life.\n\nMost of them never experienced any kind of Christian lifestyle, so it was important that their kids got all that.

I believe that change is constant and values and thought processes always change and get mended again and again, new era's and generations come with new and different values and meaning of words have different connotations and go through semantic changes, sorry I do not talk often however when I do it's blabbering in all directions anyways I will get to my point.\n\nNow hypothetically if the existence of God or Gods were proven or they have come to earth from their \"heavenly abode\" and be present before you, would you believe in them & start worshipping these entities? Would you do as they command?\n\n I put myself in this position and took alot of self reflection to come to a conclusion that I wouldn't bow down unless I am being tortured even then I would not be worshipping in heart, it would simply be a chore to get away from the torture but then again as I said earlier change is constant, there is so much about science we don't know because we simply aren't there yet. Sometime ago I had come across Clarke's third law - Any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic. \n\nIn short Gods might exist and I still won't worship them, does that really make me an atheist? In my day to day life I don't think of God at all, when I do it's because of atheism posts on my feed, not even the images/idols around me or the Azaan every morning or in the evenings make me think of God or their existence, i simply ignore and take them for granted like gravel under feet or the birds flying. I don't research on god's or religion so I can fight with theists using their own made up shit. I simply ignore them. \n\nAlso I totally unrelated but when my mind wanders it really wanders, anyone has thought that dogs are to humans what humans are to the gods, or gods are extraterrestrial beings using earth as a transit point and primitive humans thought them to be the almighty creators refer to Clarke's 3rd law, I like sci-fi hence these thoughts.\n\nWhat's your opinion?",

I ask myself this from an atheist point of view, looking at (mostly) religious people, or at least those who believe in some god or an afterlife. My point is, won't they meet again in heaven? I guess it is a similar situation when a loved one goes away on a long trip or something, and a person feels sad for their absence; but something that I noticed is how the people mourning always say things like: \"They are gone forever,\" \"I'll never see him/her again,\" etc. I understand the feeling of sorrow when a loved one dies, but shouldn't the vibe be more of a \"see you soon\" rather than that of a permanent loss?   \nWhen my grandma died, of course, I felt sorrow, but that's because I understood I would never truly see her again. My relatives, in contrast, were crying rivers and hugging the casket, and most of them are devout Catholics, full-fledged believers in god, the afterlife, and all that jazz. So, the way I see this is in three ways:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The feeling of loss is akin to someone leaving for a prolonged period; thus, it is more of an extreme sense of \"I'm going to miss you.\"\n2. They think my grandma or themselves are going to different places after they kick the bucket.\n3. They all have a slight yet profound feeling that all of this afterlife stuff is just a bunch of BS, but they won't admit it, even to themselves.\n\n  \nMaybe it is just me who thinks like this; I see death as an unavoidable part of life, and although I do feel sorrow and sadness when loved ones pass away, the whole crying, hugging the casket, and throwing my arms into the air and screaming I see religious people do, makes me wonder if they have forgotten about the whole reason they practice their faith.

  "title": "STOP saying \"All religions are bad\" whenever Islam is brought up.",
  "selftext": "Whenever someone on the internet says \"islam is a bad\" there is an immediate response: \"all religions are bad\". This just gets on my nerves so much. \n\nDo you ever bring up islam whenever other religious people commit crime? \n\nHow many Hindus, Christians or Buddhists or any other religiously affiliated people do you see blowing themselves up, or demanding murder for a burned book, or paintings or just words? \n\nWould you fear for your life if you burned a Bible or Torah, or insulted Buddha or Guru Nanak? \n\nHow many religions will kill you in this day and age for blasphemy, apostasy, or for being queer? \n\nHow many lynchings per year by Muslims vs all the religions combined. How many social nuisances caused my muslims vs all the others? \n\nThe most important part of the problem is that the don't feel guilt or shame for blocking the road for prayers or just killing an innocent for blasphemy. In fact, these acts make them feel proud. It boosts their superiority complex. \n\nMany other religions must have been extremist in the past but no other religion claims to have its teachings eternal and unchanging. This is the reason there is absolutely no room for flexibility in Islam. Also why Islam doesn't belong in today's world. \n\nWhenever a muslim country tries to set an age limit for marriage of girls, Muslim clerics protest that saying, \n\n> If our Prophet married a 6 year-old, then no one can stop us from marrying a 6 year-old. \n\nClaiming him to be the perfect role-model not just for Muslims but for all of humanity. \n\nThe whole religion is stuck in 7th century. They can't escape it even if they wanted to. \n\nAll those progressive muslims you see don't know jacksh!t about islam. Even if you show them the references, they straight up call it a **fabricated Hadith** or **wrong translation**. \n\nThese 2 words have saved Islam for so many years. A perfect cop-out to keep their faith intact. \n\nIslam is the worst of all religions, 100 times worse than Nazi ideology. Muslims who kill for islam don't feel shame or guilt, they, in fact, feel pride. Such an individual is far far more dangerous than a Nazi. Not to mention, all the other Muslims not just defend the killer, they make him a **hero**. \n\nPeople should be made ashamed of following this religion but instead we have youtubers with tens of thousands of followers openly defending pedophil!a, slavery, polygamy, murders over mere words. \n\nIslam teaches you intolerance of the highest order. \n\nI understand that criticizing islam could make you look like a \"racist\" in the west but we can't allow Islam to get away with all the misery it has caused just because we don't want to be seen racist or xenophobic. \n\nIslam has benefitted from this loophole for long enough. It's high time we exposed Islam for what it is.",

Often people who already had some doubts or misgivings.\n\nBut it doesn't work on people with a *personal* emotional need to believe in religion. Those people will always ignore or deny facts we bring to the debate, because atheism is just *too uncomfortable for them to accept*.\n\nSo if we want to reach those people, we need to take the emotional factor into account. Which also means understanding, and *adaptng to*, their emotional and cognitive perspective (no matter how different from ours, or wrong, it is).\n\nwe can't convince opposed people just by saying and showing we're factually right *even if it's true*",

  "title": "What is the Purpose of Life as an Atheist?",
  "selftext": " \n\n**Islamic Objection:**\n\n>But what about the purpose of life as an atheist? What should be one's ultimate goal in life without belief in God or a higher power?\n\n**Response:**\n\nNature lacks an inherent purpose, and its beginnings can be traced back to the Big Bang. Countless stars have emerged and disappeared over time, without any discernible reason or direction. Our planet Earth remained aimlessly for eons until life finally emerged. The sole driving force behind life's evolution was the instinct to survive.\n\nAs life continued to adapt and change, humans eventually came into being. As humans, we have **EVOLVED** to seek meaning and purpose in life through our natural physiological processes. **Our hormones** play a significant role in determining what gives us a sense of fulfilment and happiness. When we engage in acts of kindness, and altruism, or accomplish personal goals, our brains release chemicals such as endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin, which create feelings of pleasure and contentment.\n\nThus, the notion that religion is necessary for a sense of purpose in life is a common misconception. In reality, atheists can find meaning and fulfilment in various natural, scientifically explainable ways.\n\nFirstly, our brain's reward system is designed to reinforce behaviours that promote survival and well-being. Due to evolution, the release of **neurotransmitters** in humans, such as dopamine, endorphins, and serotonin creates feelings of pleasure and contentment when we engage in activities that are essential for our survival and flourishing, such as eating, exercising, having sex, helping others, and achieving personal goals. **This inherent mechanism provides a sense of purpose and motivation to pursue actions that are beneficial to ourselves and others.**\n\nSecondly, our emotional connections with others provide a strong sense of belonging and purpose. Our relationships with friends, family, and community can bring joy and fulfilment to our lives, and the desire for social connection is deeply ingrained in human nature. This desire for social bonding can give us a feeling of direction and meaning, even in the absence of religious beliefs.\n\nThirdly, personal growth, learning, and self-improvement can also provide a sense of purpose for atheists. Pursuing intellectual interests, developing new skills, and overcoming challenges can create a sense of accomplishment and fulfilment. The drive for knowledge and self-betterment can serve as a powerful source of motivation and purpose, as seen in the numerous examples of successful atheist scientists, artists, and entrepreneurs who have made significant contributions to society.\n\nFourthly, many atheists find meaning in life by contributing to the greater good. They may dedicate themselves to causes that benefit humanity, such as science, art, medicine, or social justice. By working towards the betterment of society, they can create a lasting legacy and leave a positive impact on the world. This sense of purpose can be just as fulfilling and meaningful as any religious belief.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that the concept of purpose is not unique to religious beliefs. Purpose can be subjective and varied, and can change throughout one's life as individuals grow and develop their values and goals. Atheists can find purpose in life by following their passions, exploring their interests, and creating meaningful experiences for themselves and others.\n\nIn conclusion, atheists can find meaning and fulfilment in life through various **natural, scientifically explainable means**. From hormonal responses to emotional connections, personal growth, and contributions to society, there are numerous ways for atheists to lead fulfilling lives without the need for religious beliefs.",

I'm a dumb person so I can't tell if these are lies or if he's on to something.  \n\nYou'd have to look him up but he's said things like, a lot of the layers in rock we say are ages are not, it's layered sedimentary from a worldwide flood.

I'm enthusiastic about science.\n\nA lot of us have had horrible traumatic experiences with the church. But I had a fairly good time in my church growing up. I enjoyed the ritual, we had a very young cool and kind priest, and I felt great relief from praying. I liked nuns, I liked candles, I liked lining up to get the body and blood of Christ. I liked seeing all the old people happy at church.\n\nBut I could no longer bring myself to believe in God when I turned about 11, and I was horrified when I learned about the history and reality of religion. I had what my parents called an \"angry atheist phase\". My passion for fighting Christians burned down low after a couple years, but a lot of things believers say STILL make me HORRIBLY angry. I don't LIKE catholic doctrine. I don't condone the damage the church has caused. I don't condone holding humanity back.\n\nBut the ritual of going to church, praying, the icons of the cross and Mary, rosaries and holy water, communion, all of that...my kid self liked it and got a lot out of it. And nowadays, I've felt like... I miss going to church. I really miss it. \n\nI could just go to church if I really wanted to, non-believer status be damned, but I get legit angry or yucked out when I listen to the teachings, when I see the stuff that Christians do. \n\nDuring a low point a couple years ago, when I was struggling with addiction and poverty, I tried to believe in God again. I know, that's not a great look for me. I knew lots of people found comfort in religion, and I wanted to see if I could be one of them. But I couldn't manage it. It doesn't make sense. Even at my most desperate, I couldn't manage it.\n\nI was having lots of fantasies of going to church today. It's making me sad. I'm yearning for things I don't even really want.  \n\nI suppose I was indoctrinated as a kid, and since it was overall a positive experience for me, a part of me wants that nice time in church back.\n\nId love to get these feelings under control haha 😅 \n\nHas anyone here ever felt similar?",

And generally I would say leave the damn kids alone, even tho it has some benefits Don't do it on newborns.\n\nFor anyone who was born circumcised what is your experience with that?

The left is supposed to defend women's rights, LGB rights, trans rights, freedom of expression and Identity, freedom of religion and freedom to have no religion, and to oppose racism and bigotry. \n\nAs a gay person, It is such a betrayal to have leftists take the side of Jihadi islamists who would massacre them at the first chance they get for any and all of their values. \n\nThe great irony is that Islam is the nazism of the middle east, and yet Nazis in the West are roundly mocked and condemned for their disgusting and evil views. \n\nBut when Islamist Hamas performs the worst massacre in the last ten years, to standards that would make ISIS blush, there is a loud minority (not even sure if it's a minority, tbh) of apologists on the left that is silent in condemning those murderous and abhorrent attacks, and those who came out as the reports were breaking cheering it, all for the sake of attacking either Israel or by proxy, the US/western right. Islamists are by definition right wing extremists. They are WORSE than the Western right. \n\nI mean, fuck the right wing of the West with their Christian and Judaean beliefs but even though they suck balls they aren't beheading babies and raping women and dragging their corpse's through the street and cutting their dead fetuses out of their bodies! Like...it would be considered barbaric by dark age standards...\n\nWhen is that the hill you choose to die on just to 'own the GoP'? \n\nThe massacres in Israel and the fighting against Hamas that will cause a staggering amount of suffering on both sides is obviously much bigger than me and how I feel, and so much more important to focus on, but I can't help but feel that It is such a horrendous betrayal of their base of vulnerable minorities to support those that follow Islamic teachings (that are riddled with hatred and intolerance!) And who commit such awful acts of profane barbarism against complete innocents. It offends all human and moral decency, and yet there are those on the mainstream left that could seemingly watch Hamas Raping and flaying the skin off children in 4k and still go, 'Yeah but, like, at least their cause is noble...also the IDF launch bombs near civilian pop. centres!'. \n\nNo cause is righteous enough to do what Jihadis do. I cannot believe so many left leaning folk have chosen the methods and teachings of ISIL, Hamas, Hezbollah, Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, and the Taliban over both basic human morality and the values they claim to hold for their supporters who depend on the left to be tolerant and compassionate. \n\nYou can have compassion for the phasing out of Palestinian peoples by the ultranationalist state of Israel without resorting to forgiving or cheering terrorism and it's supporters. \n\nHas anyone else been experiencing a realisation that a huge number of left-leaning folk are very tolerant and forgiving of Islamist atrocities even if it means it is done at the expense of morality and their supporters? It's honestly frightening. I knew some left leaning folks were quick to jump on the tankie bandwagon when they could brush the dust off the old communist manifesto, but Jihad? Jihad?! It's Nazism in Arabic and with a religious twist.",

Not to ignore all the other terrible things that are happening, but this conflict to me is so visible that it is hard to ignore. It is hard to close your eyes to what is going on around the world.\n\nWith all the pain and suffering around us, I wish God descended from above and showed everyone guidance as religious people believe. Render all conflicts useless.  I am questioning right now if I am an atheist because I pursue truth or if I am trying to be optimistic. Because I do not know how people can believe that God exists and God is good.  How can you see all these terrible things and say to yourself \"God is Great!\" and that is what I can not understand. The world does not look so great right now. Seems to me, that all this horror makes it so easy to accept that God is not real. That is the most optimistic thing to believe.  \n\nI do not see how shouting to each other slurs and accusing each other of atrocities is helpful to resolve anything. I can not understand how people fail to see the mirror of our own in the faces of others. All the bad things that other people can do, we are capable of. And when people fall to their knees, instead of giving them a hand to lift them up, we push them down. Otherize and dehumanize. And then wonder why they are acting as if they lost their humanity. There is nothing more dangerous than a belief you could not fall from grace in your self-righteousness. What happened to the idea that we should turn the other cheek? Such a great idea, wish it was practiced more. \n\nI believe in Love. I believe in Humanity. I know we can do better. We can indeed overcome our differences and come together. Shake each other's hands, and acknowledge that we can live in harmony. Call each other brothers and sisters, not in blood, but in our intelligence and conscience. We are not citizens of countries but of the same cosmos. Don't we see the same sun every morning? Don't we see the same stars at night? Is it not big enough for all of us? Is it not enough? \n\nIt is just these days, it is hard to believe that. I wish people practiced temperance, love, and compassion. I wish people practiced what they preach. \n\nLove you all. Give a hug to your close ones for me. I believe they may need it. Let us forget about conflicts for one single moment and remember to love. \n\nEDIT: for the people who missed my point. \n\n I wish the God, that religious people claim to be all merciful was real. Which means, I wish none of all needless suffering in history existed. Not that I wish for God that continues to do nothing, if he existed (which I don't believe exist in the first place). ",

  "selftext": "This is gonna be a long one but I highly appreciate anyone who reads and responds.\n\nI’m mainly posting to see if anyone is in a similar position to me. Just to be clear, I am 100% aware that atheism is just lack of belief in a God. I’m well-aware that it has nothing to do with beliefs in spirituality or ghosts, however I do believe that any respectable Atheist doesn’t believe in any of this stuff —and I’m sure y’all can agree. But onto the story.\n\nI am an Atheist and have been since halfway through my freshman year back in high school, a semester after this story occurred. Another very important aspect being that my father lost his life to schizophrenia in a suicide when I was 2. I also have ADHD which is important information for the story as I take stimulants to treat that.\n\nBefore starting school freshman year, our local high school required a freshman orientation which was a day where only freshmen would come in to tour the school and learn about what high school life would be like and whatnot. I was terrified to start high school, growing up with ADHD it was the perfect combo of academic failure and social awkwardness up to that point sofar, and I was terrified with how this would translate to high school, so I was up the whole night before overthinking and shit. I was up all night, but still went to the orientation. I took my Concerta and man’d it out. I was almost falling asleep the whole day even despite the stimulant in my system.\n\nLater in the evening, I was thinking “I wish I had a dad to talk to about staring high school so I don’t have to stay up all damn night overthinking.” I had this thought as I was walking into the kitchen to grab a water bottle. And then for a split second, I saw him. Standing right in front of where we keep the water bottles. I blinked and he was gone.\n\nFor years I convinced myself that it was a hallucination resulting from the combination of a stimulant, stress, lack of sleep, and the fact that he was already on my mind when I saw him. But years later my brother told me that he saw the exact same thing. Our dad in the exact same spot by the water bottles, at the exact same time in his life —when he was first starting high school. I struggle to use science and logic to explain this ever since my brother told me this.\n\nIf there’s one thing that makes me question my atheism it is that. I understand that it’s only about god, but I feel like they’re linked and not believing in anything else is still very much apart of atheist culture whether it matches the definition or not. Has anyone had similar experiences? Does it make you question your lack of beliefs? Thank you.",

Thinking some higher power has a plan for you or that you’re even significant enough for some higher being to care about you would be comforting. Thinking you were put on Earth for a reason would be nice. Believing in heaven could dampen a bit of the grief of someone dying. Believing prayer can help you might provide hope. It could provide innate meaning to life without having to make your own. It could give some sense of the universe having order. \n\nMy family is christian, so were some of my previous friends (not ended over my atheism, thought I’d say so just in case someone gets the wrong idea). My grandparents are very christian and they’re the kindest people I’ve ever met. It feels a bit alienating being an atheist surrounded by christians.\n\nBut, there’s just too many other more reasonable explanations for religion for me to believe. And there’s far too many faults to seem real. \n\nHas anyone else felt this? How do you cope with it?\n\nEdit: I see now that theism isn’t the answer to pain. It’d just manifest in different questions and ways. I think overcoming the hardships of creating meaning would build a far stronger personal meaning of life and be an accomplishment to be proud of. I see how someone down in their life could easily turn to religion as a sort of quick fix for nihilism. But, I ultimately want control over my life. The freedom comes with a few struggles but it is worth it. There is beauty and much to experience in this world which is meaning enough in itself. I wanted a quick fix for nihilism and depression.

I told my friend, “I think Jesus wasn’t a real person.” To which he responded, “how could you think that, there’s literally a book about him.  I’m a little annoyed at this point, and respond,  “why would someone write a book about someone who was an average Joe at the time, it makes no sense.” This set him off and made him say one of the dumbest statements I’ve ever heard, “denying the existence of Jesus is equivalent to denying the holocaust.”  It took me a minute to respond because I was shocked at what he just said, I told him “no, it’s not. There’s plenty of photos, belongings, buildings and WITNESSES to prove the holocaust happened.” He then brought back the idea that the Bible is enough proof of the existence of Jesus. \nAfter this argument I’m considering distancing myself from my friend .  Thinking that denying Jesus is equivalent to the denying the holocaust is such a bizarre and hateful statement to tell an atheist, he wanted to put me on the same  level as an antisemite just because I don’t believe in a man who’s only trace of existence is a book that is clearly a fictional story (imo) the ironic thing is he claims to be CHRISTIAN yet smokes weed everyday and has never gone to church other than Mormon church, when he was younger, with his family. \nWould I’d be in the wrong for distancing myself from this person after this incident? After I found out, they view me on the same level as a holocaust denier because of my beliefs. I’m not really inclined to be close with him anymore.\n\nUPDATE!!!: he apparently believes that religion is the only way to have morals! He said, “of course I’m going to be raising my children religious, I don’t want them to become bad people.” He was also telling me about how he thinks he would be doing better in life if he was raised religious.

Me and my friends always dwelled in blaming all of this on Islam and even the terrible GDP of most of our Arab countries. \n\nHowever, I started reading about the history of the region and heard from my religious parents what life was like before. To my surprise, the region was not religious at all! They told me it was to a level that people would make fun of people who pray, or they gamble, or not even fast during Ramadan!\n\nSo I was curious about this and realized most of the region was radicalized by material conditions that imperialist western powers created! For example, in Palestine, my grandparents were driven out of Palestine by Jewish people in 1948 among 700 thousand Palestinians. This ethnic cleansing of Palestinians radicalized many including my family to be ultra religious! \n\nThe more you look into it, you realize that there are some kind of material conditions that drove these people to be more religious. \n\nIt devastates me when I see 'intellectuals' like Sam Harris not even acknowledge that there are material conditions that made the middle eastern region the way it is. All he has to say is that Islam is bad and that's it. \n\nSo now lately, I think that Islam is not really to blame for all the violence and hate in the middle east. You may point out to a mass shooting justified by Islamic rehtoric but mass shootings happen for all reasons and Muslims have been victims of mass shootings. Yes ofcourse Muslims have problems such as homophobia and so on but I really don't think it's a problem with Islam, I think it's a problem with the material conditions that the majority of Muslims have been subjegated to. \n\n\nI will give one major example. Saudi Arabia. Dude is a psychopath but he does want to 'Westernize' the country to make it more appealing to investors. Guess what? He was able to do it in less than 5 years with no revolutions what so ever. He said fuck Islam and did what he wanted and Muslims just followed. I think faith and religion just molds and morphs itself to fit the material conditions people find themselves in. \n\n\nSo for people in Gaza, dying by the thousands weekly, kids having no surviving family members, do you think they would be like yeah actually death sucks and my parents died for nothing or would they glorify death to deal with the situation? That's what pisses me off with Sam Harris, he thinks these kids are raised to glorify death and that's why they die.

I find that some atheist somewhat have the belief that science has essentially solved everything and thus atheism is the most logical philosophy. Rather than having a lack of belief in God they have a belief in the absence of any God. It may seem pedantic but this is a notable difference in philosophy. \n\nI'm not here to judge anyone for what category they would fall in but I would say that to be certain in the belief of the absence of God requires more faith than simply not believing in God/religion.\n\n\nThe fact that there are still numerous fundamental scientific questions that remain unsolved such as the nature of consciousness, the incongruence of quantum mechanics and general relativity, and the question of if we are alone in the universe are evidence to the fact that we have merely made a small chip in the grand scheme of complete knowledge.\n\nWith that being said I think it's rational to take the position that there may be truths and phenomena about reality that are either incomprehensible to the human mind or would seem highly improbable if they were revealed to us. This doesn't mean that human religious ideals stand as good likely theories, in fact the probability of any human religion being true is near zero. However for me my atheism is largely informed by the obvious ignorance humanity has about the nature of reality. It's not that I'm certain of the absence of God/religion being true, it's that I don't put any belief in any proposed human religion as they are all logically unsound. \n\nThis doesn't mean that I'm agnostic and \"half/half\" on the idea of God/religion being true.

He has greatly contributed to the atheist ex-Muslim community, raising awareness about Islamic oppression. He has my respect!\n\n[But he wasn't very fortunate in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcEPfFYrpAA) criticizing Richard Dawkins for creating an \"atheist cult\".\n\nDavid Wood says Richard Dawkins follows a faulty methodology that would reject any kind of evidence of the existence of God - even if God sent a signal (the second coming of Jesus, an audible voice from the skies, a message written in the stars...) Richard Dawkins would reject all that evidence: he wouldn't rule out the possibility of extraterrestrial technology, David Copperfield... or simply hallucinations (and let me add: Elon Musk😂).\n\nI find it amusing that David Wood pretentiously thinks he has brilliantly debunked the foundations of atheism 😂... when he simply can't understand the scientific method.\n\nRichard Dawkins is thinking with a scientific brain: scientific evidence cannot be based on belief. If God sends some signal of his existence, you have to ***believe*** that this signal is from God... and not from a magician, extraterrestrials, or hallucinations... it might as well be from the Devil trying to deceive us! So how can you rule out all belief and turn it into scientific evidence that this signal is actually from God? If God exists, how can one put Him under the microscope? I think nobody knows the answer.\n\nDavid Wood also laughs at Richard Dawkins raising the possibility that \"God\" could be extraterrestrial technology. If you consider it with reason, it's not all that laughable.\n\nDuring World War II, US military flew over Pacific islands and dropped boxes with supplies and gifts. Tribal people came to believe they were gods and made rituals and altars worshiping airplanes (see: [cargo cult)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult). There are more examples of this from centuries back: it wasn't uncommon that indigenous peoples, like the Astecs, thought that the Europeans were Gods.\n\n**Here we have evidence of at least one way humans create religion!**\n\nWhich hypothesis is more plausible and does not break any laws of science?\n\n1 - Jesus was an entity with superpowers to heal the sick, walk on water, resurrect, ascend to heaven...\n\n2 - Jesus was an astronaut from an advanced civilization who visited Earth, and the technology he used was interpreted by earthlings as divine powers.\n\nBased on current evidence, none of the hypotheses are very plausible, but within the narrative, only the second hypothesis would be possible following scientific laws. The same goes for the creation of religion in general.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: David Wood claims Richard Dawkins follows a faulty methodology for rejecting any kind of evidence of the existence of God. Wood fails to understand that scientific evidence cannot be based on belief. If God sends some signal of his existence, you have to ***believe*** that this signal is from God and not from something else. So how can you rule out all belief and turn it into scientific evidence that this signal is actually from God? I think nobody knows the answer (if you do, please let me know).",

  "title": "Genuine questions about The Satanic Temple",
  "selftext": "I have genuine curiosity about TST and (so far) a mixed assessment of the organization. I welcome insights!  \nFirstly, I'm an atheist and secularist. I value rationalism, skepticism, evidence, the scientific method, etc., and I generally reject all superstitious, supernatural, religious, and \"spiritual\" beliefs as unproven nonsense (this has, incidentally, put me at odds with those who call themselves \"witches\" and \"neopagans\" who believe in magic, spirits, and other deities). I'm also a deeply progressive person, politically speaking.  \nPart of me understands and even supports TST. I gather that they are an atheist \"religion\" that promotes secularism, fights for the separation of religion and government, combats religious privilege, and exposes religious hypocrisy. These are all good and worthy causes, since they align with the secular and atheist movement more broadly. Frankly, they seem like a progressive political activism organization--and for these reasons, I sometimes applaud them. You might consider me a fan of their work.  \nBut it's not just their love of satanic iconography and imagery that rubs me the wrong way (I get why they do it, but I'm just not a fan of that stuff). I run into problems with how seriously they consider themselves to be an actual religion. I know Lucien Greaves has this whole thing about redefining \"religion\" to include sincere belief systems that reject superstition and supernaturalism and theism.  \nLike, if they were actually just a troll religion (that is, totally a joke that some of us are in on) to expose how ridiculous religions are in the first place, I'd totally be into it. Heck, I might even join 'em! But they seem to seriously think of themselves as genuinely religious, and they often adorn themselves in the trappings and language and visage and even rituals of other religions, all of which just massively turn me off. My initial response to this is, why all the religious nonsense and language and activities when we're just atheists and secularists who value science and rationalism? Why all the dressing up at SatanCon with \"ministers\" who vaguely resemble cult-ish Catholic priests and whatnot? They don't look like people who value science and rationalism--they just look like a weird cult.  \nThen I hear some members talk about how they don't want to insult or bring down other religions. But, like ... isn't it good to combat superstition, supernaturalism, and other whacky religious/spiritual beliefs? The more modern and secular and scientifically grounded society is, the better society would be, right? Isn't it a worthy goal to demonstrate how ridiculous all religious and supernatural beliefs are and why they have no real place in a modern society? Christianity isn't the only problem here--it's religious and supernatural beliefs in general.  \nI suppose that's where I really start to question the strategic value of calling yourself a \"religion.\" Aren't you dragging yourself down to all other religions by including yourselves in their big club?  \nDon't get me wrong, part of me admires the tactic of fighting fire with fire, so it's the actual goals TST fights for I wonder about. Do they actually fight for a more secular and less supernatural society? Do they actually promote skepticism and science and rejection of superstition?  \nI saw on one of the pagan reddit boards that someone who calls herself a \"pagan witch\" who \"works with other deities\" joined TST and was wondering if that would conflict with her spiritual beliefs. Well, TST explicitly rejects superstitious and supernatural beliefs, right? So how would an unironic pagan witch who literally believes in supernatural forces have a place in an organization that is atheistic and nonsupernatural? Isn't TST giving credence of that person's supernatural beliefs instead of working to show how ridiculous supernatural beliefs are?  \nAll of this is just pretty confusing to me. Then there's also the utter confusion the name, iconography, and whatnot will inspire among people of other religions (especially Christianity), who will likely harden their belief that all atheists are just devil worshippers or something.  \nAnyway, forgive my confusion and ignorance. Any insight on this topic is totally welcome!",

  "selftext": "So, it's easy enough to argue against Christianity; one can look at all the edits and contradictions in the Bible, or the philosophical issues behind an allegedly all-loving god, or the behavior of Christians, or how my childhood pastor strangled his wife into a coma and walked away a free man, or all the observable science that contradicts said Bible.\n\nWhat about a malevolent creator? I sometimes find myself suspecting a creator being that enjoys watching suffering, and wired in some basic \\*\\*\\*\\*ery into the nature of reality, like entropy, but either was insufficiently omnipotent to make things turn into an all-consuming hellscape, or insufficiently omniscient to figure out a way to make our lives entirely miserable without us growing numb to it, or because they were acting in opposition to some other dualistic force.\n\nIf you can't point at a bunch of hypocrites, and there isn't a collection of short stories originally made by illiterate desert nomads, and there isn't a laughably false premise to attack such as \"god is good\", what basis do you use to dismiss the possibility of a supreme being that's just kind of an ass?\n\nI'm not trying to convert anyone to the Northern Mississippi Synod of Kind of an Ass, here. I was raised in the church, and even after rejecting it I find myself drifting into a sort of nebulous, edgy theism. I'm curious how others avoid this.\n\nEDIT: Okay, let me rephrase that, since I approached the issue at a slant. I'm very impressed that you can all manage to dismiss any claim that lacks evidence on purely scientific grounds. Bravo, 10 points for your epistemology.\n\n\"I'm curious how others avoid this.\" Does anybody have suggestions for rejecting the underlying patterns of thought that stay with me, despite having consciously rejected all the particulars of Christianity? The Church of Kind of an Ass doesn't exactly enhance my general quality of mental life. Did anybody here have trouble banishing the lingering gremlins of religious thought, and how did you get from where I am to your current, enlightened states?

  "selftext": "I need to be honest about my feelings and curious to see what others think. Let me start by saying that I'm in no way \"pro-Israeli.\" I am entirely aware of the sufferings that Israel has and continues to inflict upon the Palestinian people, whether it be enforced apartheid, annexation of land via settler colonialism, or the repeated bombing and killing of Palestinian people (many of them children). Indeed, the whole notion of the modern Israeli state established back in the 40s, built upon Zionistic ideology, is stupid and wrong, based upon ancient ethnocentric tribal religious literature, which has no place in modern politics. People have a right to be upset about what is happening now, and I stand behind it.\n\nThat being said, it is no secret that Gaza is controlled through and through by Islamic fundamentalism. Hamas, an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist organization, was knowingly and freely elected by the people of Gaza. Do I need to insult you people by telling you all that is wrong with societies controlled by Islam? What happens to atheists or apostates in these countries? What about LGBTQ+ people? What about people of a different religious persuasion? Islamic countries routinely persecute and often execute or jail people in these categories via direct authority from their scriptures and traditions, and Palestinian territory is no different. These people, by and large, are overwhelmingly zealous for Islam. This is unsurprising since there is little access to proper education and science. There is a very good chance that if I were to proclaim myself as an atheist or apostate in Gaza publicly, I would not make it through the night. \n\nAnd, as you can see, it's not just the theocratic governments. It is the danger from the people themselves. Compared to Israel today, which is a largely secular nation, there is no danger in being gay, non-religious, or of a different faith. I would face no threat from the people in Tel Aviv, for example, in being non-religious. I would in Gaza. Do you see the comparison? In my opinion, one society, despite all its shortcomings, is inherently better and more progressive than the other. \n\nI find it so frustrating and funny that many Western liberals and feminists are very quickly, without thinking, rallying behind the cause of Palestine. A popular modo is that Palestine will be \"free from the river to the sea,\" and I'm just thinking, free to do what exactly? Continue to enforce Sharia Law, bigotry, misogyny, and science denial on the population? Free to continue to subjugate women to the domination of men? I very much feel for the sufferings of the Palestinian people, but I don't know if I can get behind the \"free Palestine\" movement all the way because of these issues. ",

  "selftext": "I recall reading some ridiculous theory that Eve was actually created from Adam's penis bone and not his rib which is why men no longer have a penis bone unlike most other mammals, but then it got me thinking: If Eve was created only after Adam bemoaned not having a companion, would Adam have had a penis to begin with or was it an add on that developed after he had something to mate and reproduce with?  Or perhaps the penis was exclusively for urination and the balls and prostate grew in after the fact?  Furthermore, if we're to believe that Yaweh is male because he created Adam in his image, and later came down to earth as a man, what would constitute Yaweh -the father- as male?  Does Yaweh have a dick?  If so, what would he be doing in infinite nothingness with a penis? \n\nThe mind wanders...",

  "title": "On Religion and the pursuit of an Afterlife",
  "selftext": "There is a god, and Christianity is right to put their faith in him, he is us. I am the God of my universe, as you are yours. Because to put your faith in God, is to trust and believe in yourself. But,  “God” is not a physical person or some ancient deity with some rule book that decides your fate after death. The concept of a “God” is a powerful tool used to be able to cope with the harsh and scary reality of life and how insignificant we are in the grand scheme of things.\n\nWhere Christianity and other religions falter, is the belief in an actual omnipotent being/beings that somehow have the power to manipulate the universe and grant you access to eternal salvation. That is, only if you follow the rules that were “transcribed” by some “devout” follower who heard voices up in a cave on a mountain, or whatever the case may be. \n\nThere is a Heaven, and it’s here on earth, in our reality, because Heaven is not a location, it is a state of mind. And everyone can get to there by believing and following the word of God (yourself) \n\nBecause you find that there’s nothing more transcending than being able to love and express yourself for who you really are. Because it is only YOU that has the power to change your world. Relinquishing the credit to some imaginary being is robbing yourself, and others, the recognition you deserve for the hardships you’ve endured. ex. Is it really god that saves someone when there’s an accident? Or, maybe it’s the doctors, (people that devoted their life to helping others), who saved that person on the table by performing a 12 hour surgery, not some made up being that someone may or may not have prayed to.\n\n\nNow, for the controversial take. Christianity, and other religions that are pushing the narrative of an afterlife AND threatening to exclude a specific group of people based on whether or not they follow some imaginary rules…. is inherently way more satanic than how the satanic church is portrayed.\n\nTo call some made up deity “God” and follow the words written by some random humans who claim to have transcribed the words, “spoken” to them, is to create and worship a false idol. Because to put your faith in a “god” is to rob yourself, and others you perceive to be sinners, the ability to reach Heaven. \n\nTL;DR: There is no factual evidence of an afterlife, yet Heaven is real. It’s just not a place, it’s a state of mind. There also is a God, he’s just not some omnipotent being, we are our own gods. And only believing in God(Yourself) will lead you to Heaven(A fruitful life lived to the fullest, only accessible to those who truly follow and openly express their own passions, beliefs,  AND refuse to perpetuate the hurt that we continue to spread.)",

I’ve also always been into theology and lately have been reading books by a New Testament scholar. \n\nMy religious life before deconverting was very concerning. I have bipolar disorder and had very intense religious delusions. I thought I was the reincarnated Virgin Mary, I visited heaven and talked to god multiple times, thought I was a prophet. Thought at one point I had proved a connection between all major faiths proving god existed. I tried to start my own church. \n\nI was also very into monastic life, specifically the self harm for servitude of the lord. Reading this book all about the book of revelations and comparing it to the historical Jesus’s teachings, I realized my own “church” was like very accurate to the historical Jesus and what he preached. \n\nSomehow I find this discomforting. I had this one dream/vision of Christmas one year. I spent the whole day of the 24th on my knees in a stone chapel scrubbing the floors. My knees stared bleeding and the blood ran into the soapy water. This was in servitude to to Jesus.Apparently Jesus was big on serving in the extreme. Full blown poverty and constant servitude to others until you are as low as you can go and then beg god for more strength to serve more.\n\nI don’t know why learning that my delusions lined up more with Christ than the church ever has, but it’s been weird. I know that it’s not real, but it’s giving me weird sensations again and I don’t want to slip back into the religious fervor. Almost joined a cult last time and nearly lost my life.\n\nI know it’s not real, but it feels real in a weird way. And I don’t know how to rationalize what’s happening.",

  "title": "Some unknown facts about Sikhism",
  "selftext": "A lot of people are under the impression that Sikhism is a great religion with very few, if not zero shortcomings that emphasizes humanity, charity and universal brotherhood. And that is true to some extent, but there are some things that are hidden to the general public even among Sikhs, and I think it would be interesting to unravel them and have a discussion about it.\n\nSo let's start with Guru Tegh Bahadur, the 9th Sikh guru, and the second last human guru of Sikhism overall. He was described as an itinerary guru who travelled across the Indian subcontinent , preaching and also involving himself in the political affairs of the country such as mediating and interceding in disputes. He eventually bought a site near the Himalayan range and had a city built on it called **Anandpur Sahib**. During his time, there was the reign of a Mughal ruler, Aurangzeb, who is widely considered to be one of the most oppressive and intolerant rulers in Indian history, and was vigilant in wanting to implement orthodox Islamic rule throughout the subcontinent, and he was ruthlessly efficient in quelling rebellions and expanding his empire. Hindu and Sikh sources make it very, very clear that Muslim oppression was rampant during this period. Sikh tradition has it that a congregation of Kashmiri Hindus approached Guru Tegh Bahadur on account of their oppression and forced conversions in Kashmir, the Guru is said to have responded by saying that such activities can only be mitigated by the sacrifice of a holy man, his son Gobind Das, was said to have overheard and responded by saying \"Who could be a greater sacrifice than you to defend the poor Brahmins\". And so Guru Tegh Bahdur left for the capital Delhi to protest against the injustice and was detained by the Mughals and later executed for refusing to convert to Islam. Mughal/Persian sources state that the Guru was actually executed for plundering and coercing donations from the people of Punjab along with a Muslim associate. Both sides ofc have reasons to make their side look good so there's definitely embellishment on both sides and we don't know the exact story.\n\nGuru Gobind Das (or Guru Gobind Rai, later Gobind Singh) was shortly thereafter made the next Sikh guru. Sikh tradition has it that Guru Gobind Das ruled in Anandpur Sahib, had 52 court poets which would translate various Hindu scriptures and the original compositions of Guru Gobind. He would have many conflicts with the Hindu hilly kings near Anandpur, causing him to temporarily relocate and was determined in overthrowing the Mughal rule at the time. He would later create the Khalsa (baptized community of Sikhs), mandating to them the belief in one God alone, and made the Sikhs a military order that would transcend caste proscriptions and injunctions which is why Sikhs use the name Singh and Kaur to hide any caste indicators in their name, and was determined in defeating the Turks (archaic way of saying Muslim in that time). Eventually the Hindu hill kings and the Mughals created an alliance to remove Guru Gobind Singh from Anandpur, they sieged the city, and when the Guru's fort eventually ran out of supplies due to being encircled, Guru Gobind Singh agreed to leave Anandpur and asked for safe passage. The Mughals and Hindu hill kings agreed and even swore upon the Quran and the holy cow respectively. Both of them broke their promises and pursued Guru Gobind while he was leaving, in the confusion 2 of Gobind's children were killed in battle and the other 2 captured, taken to Sirhind and executed after they refused to convert to Islam. Guru Gobind Singh later met a Hindu monk in Nanded, Maharashtra called Madho Das, later Banda Singh Bahadur, and made him his military successor before the Guru was assassinated.\n\n**So obviously the siege of Anandpur is a watershed moment in Sikh history, it led to the death of all 4 of Guru Gobind's children and led to the downfall of Guru Gobind himself, but what is left out in modern discourse is the casus belli of the siege which is that the Sikhs were actually the transgressors and were constantly looting and harassing the villagers in the hill kings' territories. The number of Sikhs in Anandpur Sahib began to proliferate rapidly during the early 1700s and because of that the Sikhs were compelled to loot from other villages. Eventually this got out of hand and the hill kings decided that Guru Gobind had to be kicked out and petitioned the Mughals in the upcoming siege. And this is Sikh sources in the 1700s and 1800s that mention this. There is a text called Gursobha which was written in 1711 by one of Guru Gobind Singh's court poets, it says in Chapter 11**\n\n>That was how the Khalsa conducted itself, Daily would its warriors invade the villages. Whosoever came out of a village to receive them, Some offerings in kind would he offer to the Khalsa.||5||408|| If some one showed reluctance in making an offering, Instantly, would the Khalsa plunder his belongings. As Khalsa’s rising power became a talk of the town, The hill chiefs started confabulating among themselves\n\nIn another primary source, Ratan Singh Bhangu who is one of the most prolific and influential Sikh historians wrote in his Gur Panth Prakash\n\n>The Khalsa force, thus, adopted such a strategy, Which they kept on practising for a considerable time. When the numerical strength of the Panth (Sikh nation) increased manifold, They decided to impose a mandatory tax on the people. As the Khalsa Panth kept on increasing day by day, They started feeling the scarcity of provisions and clothing. So they passed a resolution to the effect: That they must impose a compulsory contribution on each village. When people refused to make the compulsory contribution, The Singhs used violent and coercive methods to get provisions. The affected people went to approach the Mughal rulers, And petitioned against the Singhs for their violence and coercion\n\nAnd this narrative is also confirmed by very reputable researchers such as Louis Fenech in his Oxford University book The Sikh Zafar-namah of Guru Gobind Singh, Anshu Malhotra, Farina Mir in their Oxford University book Punjab Reconsidered: History, Culture, and Practice and even Jagtar Singh Grewal in his Cambridge University book The Sikhs of the Punjab.

The Sikhs came and went and the Guru's darbar daily increased in pros- perity and splendour. Two years and some days passed in this manner when again the old sore reappeared. The Khalsa horse- men again began to fall upon villagers and levy contributions by force. Those who paid forthwith were not troubled further but those who delayed or refused were looted. The plain truth was thus brought home to the Hill chiefs that they could have no peace and security until the Guru was expelled from Anandpur. Evidently the villages around Anandpur had been ceded to the Guru by the Raja of Kahlur as a part of the agreement already referred to, and this, as we have seen, had ensured peace for two years. The Guru and the Hill Rajas apparently lived on friendly terms and the Mughals had no reason to interfere. But with the gradual increase of the Guru's power and the number of his followers, he oould not go on without a further expansion of territory and the old troubles reappeared. Fresh hostilities be- oame inevitable and the Hill chiefs arranged a formidable com- bination against the Guru. An ultimatum was sent to the effect that the Guru must forthwith evacuate the fort of Anandgarh\n\nBanda Singh Bahadur who avenged Guru Gobind Singh and his sons' deaths by killing Wazir Khan (the man responsible) and is today respected and celebrated by many Sikhs was actually kicked out of the Sikh religion by Guru Gobind Singh's wife. Many sources say that he went against the Guru's commands like changing the Sikh dress, the Sikh slogan, demanded that the Sikhs be vegetarian only, and even that he was harsh towards the Muslim commoners during his quest to conquer Punjab and even practiced caste rituals that the Sikhs were ordered to disregard completely. We know for a fact that him and Mata Sundri were at odds with each other, and Banda even wrote letters to Mata Sundri calling her a dumb woman. Because the Sikhs who allied with Mata Sundri abandoned Banda, the Mughals were able to capture him and it led to his grisly execution.\n\nSo yeah, I just thought this was interesting, and it shows that even in \"good religions\" like Sikhism and Buddhism, there's some issues and ugly history in it. And btw, more than eager to hear the Sikh POV, as honestly I want to learn more about Sikh history and religion",

There have been claims that nearly 2,000 gods exist. As an atheist, I do not believe in any of them, but a Christian, for example, is almost the same as me: they disbelieve in 1,999 gods. So, to other religions, isn't a Christian an atheist?\n\nObviously this is just semantics, but this thought process can help us in our conversation to explain to religious people our disbelief in a god. \"Do you, a Christian, believe in Allah?

  "selftext": "Oftentimes (just now in fact on another subreddit) I’ll hear the phrase “Sometimes atheists are better Christians than ‘real’ Christians” or some variation of that.\n\nThis is not true and I’m tired of hearing it.\n\nWhen people use this phrase, what they are doing is equating ‘being Christian’ with ‘being a good person’.  Like they’re the same thing, simply interchangeable.\n\n“Christian” = “Good”\n\nWhat people (Christians are the ones who usually use that phrase) are actually saying, without having to say it, is that “Sometimes atheists are better people than Christians.”\n\nWhy can’t Christians bring themselves to say that instead?  Moreover, I am shocked when I see a self proclaimed atheist agree with the sentiment.\n\nIn fact, I believe that the “better” Christians are the old school crowd.  They’re the ones who understand that their God is full of hate towards women, gays, and minorities, and so they embody those values for themselves.  The “worse” Christians are the newer ones, the ones who claim that Jesus loves everyone, ‘just ignore the last chapter in our book where Jesus sets everyone on fire’.\n\nRegardless, atheists are NEVER ‘better Christians’ than some Christians.  We don’t believe in Jesus ffs, how could we be?\n\nBut many times an atheist can be a better PERSON than some Christians.\n\nEdit - Yes, I am aware that the people using this phrase aren’t being vindictive.  I am also aware that the phrase is used as a way of saying that atheists follow the teachings of Christ better than other Christians.\n\nI know all of this.  And Idc.\n\nIf you want to say that sometimes an atheist is a better person than a Christian, then just say that.\n\nStop equating “Christian” with “Good”.  Just stop.",

I have a habit of becoming kinda obsessed with semantics..\n\nFor me, something can only be a binary in the form of \"X vs not-X\", where X can either be or not be, but not both or neither.. maybe that's just because I'm a programmer and think of binaries as boolean values..\n\nYou can certainly have/make a binary definition of sex, if you base it upon the existence vs non-existence of a certain type of gamete or a Y-chromosome.. But you'd then have to content with the cases that doesn't fall in line with a traditional/common understanding of sex..\n\nThe more I learn about the complexities of sex development, the harder it is to find a binary definition that doesn't either over-include or under-include what most people would categorize as either male or female..\n\nSex is a bimodal spectrum.. That really is the best way to describe it..\n\nEDIT: Another reason why basing sex on gametes, chromosomes or genitals isn't a practical definition, at least for the general population, is that we can't see each others gametes, chromosomes or genetals (unless we happen to see them naked), and yet we seem to be pretty good at categorizing people in public as either male or female.. So it seems that the most commonly used determinant of how we categorize sex is based purely on gender presentation, which is not at all binary..",

  "selftext": "I'm thinking about this because on another subreddit a Christian asked about why Christians don't act like how Christians are \"supposed\" to act.  It made me look back on becoming one.  I am \"elder millennial\" age now and it's been about 15 years of being an atheist now.\n\n Below was my response to that post that I put way too much effort in to in hindsight.  It just got me thinking.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nA  lot of churches teach that all you need to go to heaven is to believe  in god and that's it.  Others teach belief AND actions are required.\n\nA  lot of Christians just feel morally superior calling themselves so and  treat it like their tribe in which they exclude others that they assume  to be evil, since anything not Christian is evil to them.  To them they  get to feel superior by telling themselves god is on their side and feel  validated, but everyone else is a heathen and evil.  This does not  require them to actually do the hard work of being a good person, they  feel like they are good person for simply being in the tribe.  It's  about superiority and gives them license to believe they get a \"pass\"  for their own bad behavior.\n\nI'm  sure they don't all consciously think of it in those blatant terms but  that's what it is.  There are certainly Christians who just play along  and exploit far more intentionally or mindfully.\n\nIn  my own personal experience, Christians love to believe they are moral  good people simply by virtue of being Christian and everyone else is  \"lesser\" and immoral.  They believe they are good people or at least on  average are far more moral than the \"others.\"  In my experience,  Christians are not more moral than non-Christians and it's not even  close.\n\nI'm a former Christian, but  years before I stopped being one I felt alienated from others and  churches.  I never fit in to their idea of what a Christian should  be...I was excluded.  I wasn't conservative or traditional, I stopped  going to church because my own reading of the bible and interpretation  was vastly different from what was taught or the actions I saw the gap  between how other Christians acted versus what the bible actually  taught, etc.  For years I felt I had my own personal Christianity and  relationship with god that was based off of what I actually read in the  bible.  Most Christians don't even read the bible, they just go to  church and look for validation to keep on doing what they're already  doing.  Despite this, I was looked down on even then.\n\nIt's  hard not to be bitter about my experience and even harder not to be  bitter about how Christians continue to act and treat me and other  people they deem \"other\" all while trying to impose their own *personal*  values on others under the pretense that this is what GOD wants, not  themselves.  It's self-righteous, condescending, and disrespectful  before you even get to the harm being done.",

I used to like his videos as I am fascinated by FICTIONAL mythology and religions as a writer, but the more videos I watched from him, the more I noticed he constantly tried to shoehorn in random Christian proselytizing. \n\nIt felt off putting and ironically it was probably uncomfortable for people of different, non-Christian faiths to watch too. Im a former Christian so I can detect the subtle worm of this type of propaganda very well!\n\nLike, in his 8 HOUR Conspiracy Theory Iceberg, does he talk about the Roswell Incident, one of the most famous conspiracy theories of all time? No, he talks about “Gods Ego Death” which isn’t even a conspiracy. A conspiracy is a plot to withhold information. Where in the fuck is there a conspiracy to withhold “Gods Ego Death” from the masses?\n\nHe also seems to have a weird bias against aliens. You know, the most scientifically plausible of all supernatural phenomena that the Bible says literally nothing against? In his Local 58 video, he goes on a weird tangent about how the living Moon is not an alien, with the flimsy justification of “It’s more like a Lovecraftian being like the Brethren Moons from Dead Space” … bruh, both the Brethren Moons and Lovecraftian beings are objectively Extraterrestrials. Not all of Lovecrafts monsters were, but a vast majority are explicitly stated as “coming from the stars” this just came off as weird, nitpicks and gatekeepy.\n\nThis is just my experience with this YouTuber that most of the internet blindly soy-faces at. Being a former Christian wakes you up to lots of toxic and harmful rhetoric that Christian content creators will try and shoehorn into their content. Wendigoon, when I clicked on your “Walking Dead Iceberg” video, I wanted to hear fascinating facts about the Walking Dead, not how the Walking Dead is actually about God and you gotta watch out for “the Eid”!

The evidence is Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, Cosmic Neutrino Background (CNB), and Hubble's Laws. According to the ESA, CMB Radiation is basically cooled remnants of light that could travel the universe. It was released soon after the Big Bang. CNB is background particle radiation that is made of particles called Neutrinos. These particular Neutrinos are interesting; they are 3000 times slower than the speed of light. Hubble's laws state that galaxies are moving away from earth at speeds proportional to their distance.\n\n2.Abiogenesis: The creation of life through non biological material. The Soviet Biochemist Aleksandr Oparin and JBS Haldane made this theory. Its first step was proved by the Miller-Urey experiment. The experiment simulated \"Old Earth\". In the experiment, 20 amino acids were created, which proves that life can be created without anybody to create it.\n\n3.Religiosity and Intelligence negative correlation: Studies show that religious people have lower IQs.

  "selftext": "Based on [my recent thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/12j6ghn/agnostic_atheists_what_do_you_mean_when_you_say/) about agnosticism, it seems that a surprising number of self-identified agnostic atheists might be better-described as \"solipsistic atheists.\" I'm talking about the sort of person who says they're 99% confident that there is no god, but because they're not 100% confident, they don't *know* there is no god, and so they are agnostic.\n\nHere's the trouble. You can't be 100% confident about *anything* outside of your own mind. You could be plugged into the Matrix, or maybe Descartes' demon is deceiving all your senses. This is called the problem of hard solipsism, and there is no solution to it. \n\nSolipsism doesn't prevent us from obtaining knowledge, though, because when we say \"knowledge,\" we don't mean \"an idea held with perfect confidence.\" We mean \"an idea that held with *high* confidence.\" That's how you know anything about the world. It's how you know you're human, that the earth is round, and that Santa Claus doesn't exist. Is there technically the faintest, totally undemonstrable chance that you're actually an android replica of a human from Planet X? Yes, I suppose. Nonetheless, you *know* that you're human. You're a \"gnostic humanist,\" a \"gnostic round-earthist,\" and a \"gnostic aSantaist.\"\n\nFor some reason, though, a lot of people on this sub seems to hold an exception to that requirement for knowledge: they don't permit positive disbelief in gods without 100% confidence. In other words, they feel unable to honestly say \"I know there is no god.\" Why do you demand such a strict degree of certainty in order to know that gods do not exist? Do you hold that same standard for all the other things you know? If not, then aren't you holding a double-standard?",

The video delves into what I call 'cognitive echoes' - those lingering Christian beliefs and habits that persist in our minds even after we've moved away from religious faith.\n\n  \nIn this video, I share my personal experiences and explore why these remnants of faith continue to influence us, how they shape our decisions, and most importantly, how we can identify, understand, and rewire these echoes to better align with our current beliefs and values.\n\n  \nI've incorporated practical insights and techniques, such as mindfulness and critical self-inquiry, to help anyone who might be struggling with similar issues. It's not just about identifying these cognitive patterns but also about learning to control them and shape our thought processes in a more rational and independent way.\n\n  \nI believe this video could be a valuable resource for many in this group, especially for those who might still find themselves grappling with the vestiges of their Christian upbringing. \n\n  \nI invite you all to watch the video, and if you find it insightful, consider subscribing to the channel for more content like this.

I'mma go to bed now and see how this goes.  \n\nI also don't tell my kids that Christmas is bullshit.  I think that the \"Spirit of Saint Nicholas\" is something that we feel when we give to people, are helpful, and kind.  Full stop.  Call it whatever you like, but altruism and compassion are proven to be good for their practicioners.  I am very vocal about how Christmas is an astronomical event, if you will, or seasonal, just like Halloween and Easter, that was co-opted by the Catholic church.\n\nNow, here is what I'm getting at. I wouldn't want my kids anywhere near Satanism, not because I think it is evil, but because it defines itself *in relation, in opposition* to Christianity.  I'm not *opposed* to Christianity, just like I'm not opposed to Christmas.  I think there is an ancient element of truth to it, but it's been completely co-opted and wielded as a power over people. Ultimately, we are spiritual beings, just as we are imaginative beings.\n\nI don't ban my kids from \"believing\" in unicorns and dragons, or Harry Potter, for that matter.  And I don't fault people for \"believing\" in Jesus.  I do, however, judge people on their actions, not their words or professed beliefs.  And by \"judge,\" I use that term loosely here, because I don't think we know what the fuck we're doing.  We're like cells in a body at best, ultimately.  Just parts of a greater, random machine or body, stretching across the universe.  Conscious hydrogen.\n\nAnd that brings me to my final point.  I don't really have one.  I don't think I'm an \"aethiest.\"  I had a Buddhist local leader once ask me if I'm a Buddhist and I replied, \"No, I'm a human.\"  It kind of riled him up a bit, but he wasn't Asian, so I get it.  But I do have a question.\n\nDoes \"atheism\" or being \"an aetheist\" require that one define one's self in relation to a set of beliefs and the powers that weild them?  I guess that I don't feel like a jive with aethiests because of this and I'm wondering what this community's take on that is.\n\nThanks for considering this and for your patience with my iinebriated wall of words here.",

  "selftext": "So to be fair out of the gate, we both just got written up for \"causing a workplace disturbance\" so at least management isn't taking sides, it's good to know that Corporate America doesn't care one way or another.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo begin, I work in a warehouse with about 20 other people, most of us get along just fine and never talk about anything controversial to keep the peace and make sure we can all stay friends. However a new hire, lets call him Wayne, because that is totally not his name and any connection to persons named Wayne is entirely coincidental. Wayne is first and foremost, autistic. Now I don't have a problem with that, I have autistic friends and family, I know how to handle it, We have given them benefit of the doubt on issues many times, we tolerate much more than we would with someone who wasn't clearly on the spectrum. We're pretty inclusive and accepting where I work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecond, Wayne is engaging in a bunch of Malicious Compliance, He's constantly asking questions and then behaving in a way that minimizes his effort and maximizes the headaches he causes the rest of the team, as a result, absolutely everyone else on the team can't stand him, he hasn't done anything that he can be punished for, just everything that really inconveniences everyone else around him. We've all caught on and are entirely unamused.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThird, he's a deeply evangelical Christian, and makes constant remarks about his faith, about Jesus, about God, about Sin, and how most people are sinners who need to be saved, and the whole lot. In this regard, a couple people agree with him, most avoid the subject of religion at work and then there's me. I am a deeply philosophical Absurdist Buddhist, I find that life is suffering and terrible, but at the same time absurd and hysterical, depending on the perspective you take at the moment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the other day Wayne comes up to me, and in the middle of a discussion about the products we have to ship out, within a few sentences, the conversation has gone from shipping out product as our jobs require, to the fundamental reality of what it is to be human. How exactly that happened, I cannot recall, it was in the span of like 40 seconds that we went from disposable gloves to the nature of souls. But anyways, he comes at me with a rant on how Jesus died for our sins, and how we owe it to the lord to live a good life and obey the will of God almighty.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, I told him as follows \"Wayne, no one gives a damn about your obsession with an invisible sky-daddy and his obedience fetish, nor do they give a damn about his rape-baby that promises to advocate on your behalf an eternity of suffering if you worship him fully and will save you from his father's wroth if you partake in a weekly flesh-eating and blood-drinking ritual and accept him as your sole salvation from eternal damnation.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWayne, taken aback by these statements reports me to our supervisor for religious discrimination. My supervisor, who also cannot stand him but can't find a valid reason to punish or terminate him, privately tells me that he thinks I am in the right and he is trying to once again be malicious against his coworkers as he has done numerous times before says that he privately supports me, but is officially neutral on the issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyways, I'm going to have a meeting with HR about discrimination and appropriate topics of discussion at work on Monday, and how I am not allowed to discriminate against people's religious beliefs, but neither are they allowed to discriminate against mine. and for my part, IDGAF that he believes that all people should be subservient slaves to his God, I don't care, but you try and impose that belief on me, and I'll punch you in the face with absolutely no remorse or hesitation. At the end of the day, I think HR won't side on the side of who has the better argument, and instead, who is more productive and beneficial to the company, which is 100% me, but this is so much goddamn drama that I didn't ask for, and just have to deal with because some people think the world revolves around their particular imaginary friend.",

  "title": "Reminiscing One of My Previous Church Debates",
  "selftext": "[Dan Barker vs Bryan Hurlbutt: Does God Exist?](https://youtu.be/lCvMjqyn91k)\n\nThe link above is a past debate with my former pastor, Dr. Bryan F. Hurlbutt, and someone you guys may recognise, Daniel Edwin Barker. On the topic of Bryan, he is a pretty smart guy, even though he believes in a skydaddy. The way he analyzes and comes to conclusions is pretty interesting. I was probably 15 around the time they debated, so I was still drinking the Kool-Aid at the time and now. The question is very simple: 'Does God Exist?' (God is capitalized for a reason). Now since Bryan was in the affirming position, he went first naturally. Since I've lost interest in religion, I would like to reminisce about this past debate between my pastor and Barker. Now here are my thoughts that I've outlined on part one of the debate:\r\n\n1. Bryan came to the conclusion that the debate is over naturalism vs supernaturalism, just like Dawkins so, naturally, I agreed on that. However, after he made his claim about Naturalism being unable to account for all of reality, that's where I drew the line in the sand. You can't say that just because Naturalism can't account for all of reality, then that means it's not true. That's very unwise in logic to be very literal.\r\n   1. He goes on stating that naturalism cannot account for human consciousness, and of course, we don't have the technology for that yet. However, this is not to say that we should rely on, base our beliefs on, have faith that faith is the solution.\r\n   2. I agree that we need to have first person perspective or testimony. We don't know what communication is happening in your brain when you see your wife unless we get a first person perspective. Yet once again, this is because we don't have the technology that would be able to translate this data. Michael Stevens from Vsauce brilliantly explains this idea in his video [Is Your Red The Same as My Red?](https://youtu.be/evQsOFQju08).\n   3. Bryan says that Naturalism's determinism and reductionism eliminates free will without realizing that the same bible he has faith in says that God is all knowing, which in turn eliminates free will.\n   4. It is very impactful to me when he says we have no \"ought\", since I'm also a nihilist, I find it more freeing than being shackled by religion.\n   5. He brings up a good argument saying \"Naturalism \\[inherently\\] kills altruism\", however he misses his mark in research of [neurochemicals released while doing altruistic actions](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4449495/).\n2. Dan smartly uses an argument to say that if God exists, God is not obvious. He also states that nobody *knows* if a god exists, rather they have a *belief*. *Belief is* ***not*** *knowledge*. \\[This reminds me of an anecdotal [quote](https://tollelege.net/2009/05/02/like-hamlet-looking-for-shakespeare-by-cs-lewis/) from Tim Keller's 'Reason For God'. Even Christians like Lewis are finding it ridiculous of trying to find this so called god and are telling us to have faith.\n   1. Dan uses a common free will argument that most of everyone uses to battle theists, but he's not even swinging yet.\n   2. \"There is no good evidence for a god and if there was, the person finding it would have won the nobel prize.\", again, common argument.\n   3. Now he starts swinging, and swinging hard. We haven't had any need for any Thors when it comes to thunder, we know electricity, nor Demeter, we have better understanding of the soil and how to farm and when it rains. *We don't need those gods anymore*. \n   4. The lack of agreement in religion is very damning in this debate for whether God exists or not. The church is so split that they don't agree on certain doctrine just because they are Episcopalian, Catholic, Protestant, etc. We non-believers won't know who to trust.\n   5. Completly agree there's no need for a god. Enough said.\n   6. He keeps swinging, saying the Old Testament is proof enough there is no god.\n   7. He closes with a very good conclusion and wrapping things up in my opinion.\n\nPart two is the rebuttal:\n\n1. Bryan \n   1. Bryan goes into the argument that \"Science hasn't answered this question, but it will!\", and I think that he isn't aware that science is \"knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through\" according to [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/science). Science eventually will be able to answer these questions.\n   2. Bryan says that Dan hates the ways of the ancient Israelites. However, I do not see why he shouldn't, what they did what absolutely horrible.\n   3. The story of Job: God shouldn't have let his servant suffer like that, God is the most egotistical person in the entire bible.\n   4. Says that it is egregiously false that there is no need for a god. I say that his argument is egregiously false, we have been doing so much better ever since we [had passed bills of freedom of religion](https://nmar.org/religious-freedom-history/), and without someone constantly breathing down our necks to be a good Christian boy/girl/whoever, we have had better progress than we ever would have with state religion. We do not need any god.\n2. Dan\n   1. He brings a good point that Bryan didn't connect any dots, and he was jumping to the conclusion of \"Therefore, God is real.\"\n   2. Consciousness isn't an object, it is a collection of objects, like traffic.\n   3. Free will being a useful illusion is an interesting argument, I think it's also important to think we have free will for moral obligations.\n3. Bryan 2\n   1. \"Why choose to be moral?\" is sort of a common argument that theists will choose to use, and I think in my opinion that it is for the same reason we do altruistic actions. Sure you can constantly ask, \"But why?\", however this same argument could be used against the Christian religion itself: there is no need to be kind or be moral when all you need to do is just have [faith in God](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%202%3A8-9&version=NIV), so there would be no need to be a good Christian boy.\n   2. I really don't like this next argument he uses (raping a woman to save \\~7 billion people), it goes to the extreme to just have a 'point'.\n   3. This next argument is interesting, the intent of harm. One is for healing, one is for harm. However Dan counters this in his second rebuttal.\n4. Dan 2\n   1. He makes a great point of saying we have evolved to do altruistic things as a species. Same thing with other species.\n   2. Intention matters, explained very well in his analogy.\n   3. Prayers would be scientifically measurable. Very interesting and good argument.\n\nNow onto the questions:\n\n1. If there is only one true God, how do you explain spiritual witnesses from religions all round the world each with their own god?\n   1. Bryan\n      1. \" ...we analyze based upon evidence, based upon narrative structure, based upon worldview.\" I am not so certain that my old church actually does this considering their political views (very right wing).\n   2. Dan's Rebuttal\n      1. They can't all be true, but they can all be false. lol\n2. Given our incomplete, fallible perception of the world, aren't all human observations/thoughts - even scientific ones - neccessarily taken on faith, to be true?\n   1. Dan\n      1. Faith =/= knowledge\n   2. Bryan's Rebuttal\n      1. Apparantly Dan was misleading and using equivocal language.\n3. If we somehow exist outside of the brain, then why does damage to specific known regions change our personality, memory, behavior, priorities, and identity?\n   1. Bryan\n      1. What I am taking away from this is that the soul is based on our body as well.\n   2. Dan's Rebuttal\n      1. The word soul should be lowercase, it is in essence just our personality.\n4. What are your thoughts on how the Church fathers - Origen, \\[Gregory of\\] Nyssa - read the bible? Is not your reading Christianity a nineteenth century, fundamentalist one?\n   1. Dan\n      1. \"If the Bible can only be understood by scholars and experts... then God did a poor job.\"\n   2. Bryan's Rebuttal\n      1. I'm not a huge nerd in the history of theism and don't plan to be, so I have no ground to counter this argument.\n5. Do you think that eternal hell is justifiable punishment for a finite sin?\n   1. Bryan\n      1. Answers with a proud yes, I don't even need to get into the ridiculousness of this.\n   2. Dan's Rebuttal\n      1. Yeah I am not groveling to kiss any god's feet just to get into his so-called loving arms.\n6. If God does not exist, how do we explain His existence in human thought throught all of human history?\n   1. Dan\n      1. Humans created these fake gods, we used them to explain weird happenstances that we have not explained yet. \n   2. Bryan's Rebuttal\n      1. There is no need for them anymore, we don't need these monsters anymore.\n7. Women are often seen as beneath men and often do not play as large of roles in Christianity. Why would God create women but not treat them equally? \n   1. Bryan\n      1. Men ane women are not treated equally this is shown [multiple times](https://baos.pub/5-awfully-sexist-quotes-from-the-bible-that-every-person-should-read-f8c2fbe1a7cc). Women's rights do NOT stem from the Judeo-Christian background, that pisses me off that he would even say that. \n   2. Dan's Rebuttal\n      1. \"Women are cheapened in the biblical traditon.\" Great way to put it.\n8. If you do not like or agree with God's way of doing things, how is that an argument against his existence? If God does exist, doesn't he make the rules?\n   1. Dan\n      1. Personally I think he held back on this one, because he didn't say that his omnibenevolence is contradictory to his behavior.\n   2. Bryan's Rebuttal\n      1. I'm not quite sure I understand this one.\n9. Religion is often dictated by a given sect's view on morality. What is your take on absolute moral truth? Are all people under a universal moral law?\n   1. Bryan\n      1. He is somewhat right until he brings God into it.\n   2. Dan's Rebuttal\n      1. There is no absolute moral truth.\n10. Is it arrogant and anthropocentric to presume that science can explain everything there is to know?\n   1. Dan\n      1. Dan puts it perfectly, we won't know every answer. Science doesn't claim that.\n   2. Bryan's Rebuttal\n      1. This doesn't mean that we should go groveling to gods to explain the universe.\n11. Would any amount of evidence change either of your beliefs? If so, how much evidence would that take?\n   1. Bryan\n      1. Claims that he is not a literalist, however he takes the bible very literally (I've seen it). Yes the ressurection of Christ is the best way to destroy the faith of Christianity.\n   2. Dan\n      1. Gives a firm no.\n12. Why do two people looking at the same evidence come to different conclusions?\n   1. Dan\n      1. Fear was a big motivator for me to stay a Christian. I hated every minute of it.\n   2. Bryan\n      1. \"Who gets to say?\" is more leaning to subjectivity rather than objectivity. He brings up self-autonomy often in his sermons, what I think it means is \"Don't be independent! Be a bunch of sheep!\"\n\nClosing statements:\n\n1. Bryan brings a good point, that we atheists aren't what we used to be. We need to be more Rocky Balboa on these theists. \n   1. He brings up that ideas like freedom, altruism, etc. are meaningless in naturalism; however he doesn't understand that that's what makes it so freeing.\n2. Dan says that we do have livable lives and who is to say otherwise. We do have good days and bad, we're in no way that different to theists other than their belief in religion.\n   1. Moral judgement is ultimately meaningless, but that it is immensely immediately meaningful.\n\nNow I loved watching this play out. I think that they both brought up great points, and I think that Bryan would have been an excellent atheist.\n\nSo thanks for reading my internal dialogue!",

  "selftext": "Conventional wisdom tells us not to argue with fools, but the problem with prolonged silence, especially in a group, is the emboldening of the theist. At some point the theist has to be mentally defeated so that he shuts up for good. **I want to make clear that the objective is not to win an argument through logic and facts**, since we know that this is impossible. Rather, it is to shame the theist or frustrate him so that he gives up. **It is no longer a debate based on facts and truth, but where you aim to mentally break the person, without making it look like you're the vile one**. I wonder if this is possible, and if anyone here has owned theists, I'm interested to hear how.\n\nEdit - I thought I'd share a tip I learnt - sarcasm by seeming to agree with the theist or flattering his intelligence when he says something ludicrous, and then asking questions on where he got his 'facts' from, can sometimes work. A pleasant, nonchalant and smiling sarcastic remark seems to work better on arrogant and imposing theists, being confrontational and argumentative usually doesn't and further encourages them to up the ante",

The Bible says He is going to plant His foot down on the Mount of Olives and go through the Eastern Gate, which is currently sealed off with 16 feet of concrete. A cemetery was also placed in front of that gate because touching the dead makes a Jew considered unclean and unable to enter the Temple, which is considered Holy. \n\nThe Word of GOD says He will return there and from there He will rule and reign for 1,000 years. \n\nThe final battle isn’t going to be on U.S. soil. It’s going to be in the Valley of Megiddo, in Israel.\n\nThe Bible says as the nations wage war against Israel Jesus will come and destroy His enemies with the breath of His mouth. 2 Thess 2:8\n\nGOD did not replace the Jews with Christians as some believe.

  "selftext": "Life can be cruel and I think it’s in our nature as humans to try to rationalize why things happen. Many times, believing in something is the only thing that keeps us going and keeps us from losing hope. \n\nBut as atheists, we can’t take the religious approach and say “god will take care of it”. As Christians the only two outcomes after a challenging situation are, “praise god for the miracle!” or “well, it was meant to be”. Really, it seems that “god” doesn’t really care how hard you believed or how much you prayed. We are simply attempting to rationalize a cold, uncaring universe that acts at random. \n\nBut that statement alone is depressing to me. How do you reassure yourself, as an atheist, that things are going to be okay? I don’t want to lie to myself about god or whatever because I know that it doesn’t make a difference. The one concept that has brought me comfort is knowing that according to the second law of thermodynamics, matter always proceeds toward a state of entropy, in other words matter always seeks to find the lowest possible energy state. So whatever the issue, according to that scientific law there will be an equilibrium. At the end of the day, the end result will always be peace. Even as living organisms, at the end of life, there is peace in death knowing that you aren’t going to burn in hell for eternity, rather you simply cease to be conscious and exist.\n\nI don’t want to come across as a “Christianity-hater” since I think everyone’s belief system is valid—whatever way you have managed to make sense of the world is valid as long as you aren’t hurting anyone of course. But as an ex-Christian, I do often find myself comparing Christianity and atheism since to this day I am unlearning many of the things I was taught as a Christian. So I’m curious how others have found ways to rationalize life as atheists, and maybe provide some input. Share some of your ideas, I’d love to hear them!",

  "selftext": "\nGreetings everyone.\n\nI‘ll head to the point real quick and tell my story. I would love if experienced ex-muslims could help me with this one as they have had more time and experience after leaving Islam.\n\nIm 18 years old, and I am pretty much mentally unstable, and the more I grow up, the more I think „I realise“ how islam worsens my condition. As if I am „waking up“. For me now, Islam is like smearing salt on an open wound.\n\nAs I have said, I am 18 years old and Turkish. I love Atatürk and I look up to him. I love him and his beliefs, such as that religion does not belong in politics. Also I guess I am and kinda religious? I pray 5 times a day, go to the mosque etc. but I honestly feel zero connection to God. I feel more Agnostic. I believe there is some kind of creator, who created the universe etc. but not gods who are „man made“ on earth.\n\nI have depression, used to have anorexia but now struggling with bulimia, and have severe hatred for myself because of my sexuality (im gay..) and I pretty much self harmed myself on a lot of places because I saw myself as „impure“ „disgusting“ „not manly“ etc. (because of religion and culture) I used to hate being gay so much, and I still kinda do but it improved pretty much. I used to cut and slice my skin with knives and razors. I have cuts on my right arm, left arm, thighs, left leg and right leg. I go to therapy sessions once a week, and have been in the psychatric hospital aswell. The self harm has stopped for now.\n\nEven though I used to be so religious, my „prayers“ never got answered. I cried and begged for years to Allah to change me and make me straight, but never happened. not even a little sign. Thats where I started to have doubts on religion.\n\nIn islam, marriage with a wife, having children etc. completes ones half of their deen. So why did God forbid mine? Why do I have to go through all of this?\n\nAlso, what made everything even worse is that I would get severely punished in the afterlife for hurting myself. That it was a major sin. If God is so allknowing and knows my future why hasnt he done anything about it? Isnt he the most merciful?\n\nI decided to get some „help“ from scholars from several mosques. No one has taught me self acceptance or love. Instead it was „stop cutting urself u will get punished for it and dont act on ur sexuality“. I also got answers such as:\n- Dont act upon it or bear consequences.\n- Story of Lut.\n- Never act on it, live miserably and alone and never find love for the rest of your life for the sake of Allah.\n- Take more men hormones by pills so I can become straight (My psychologist told me this is illegal as sexuality and feelings are not a sickness you can cure)\n- Forcefully marry a woman and never tell her (According to islamic views, isnt this totally wrong? Lying deceiving a woman etc for the rest of her life thinking a man loves her?)\n- Marry a lesbian muslim woman who also doesnt act on her sexuality for Allah and marry together and trick everyone that you are happy etc.\n\nAll these answers just made me feel more worthless and I asked every scholar „But why?“.\nIt was always the same answer.\n„Its just a test“\n\nThere are also a lot of things which doesnt make sense to me. Its such a man benefitting religion. Always men men men. Woman barely have any value. Its so strict.\n\nOr the universe. We possibly couldnt be the only living intelligent species. Thats absurd. The universe is always expanding. Billions of stars, Billions of plantes, Billions of galaxies etc. and we on earth have the only true religion?……….\ncome on.\n\nBut at the same time I wonder… what if I am wrong? I saw a few videos where things that couldn’t be proven back in time because we didnt have technology, the Quran was there to prove it. For example, back when the prophet Muhammad lived and it was said: there were 360 Joint bones in our body. Back then we werent that advanced to find it out. And today it turns out to be true. How does that work? What if Islam is the right religion and I am wrong?\n\nOr the Splitting of the Moon which is mentioned in the Quran, and nowadays it turned out to be true. Just How?\n\nExactly these things keep me struggling. Are these really just guesses, or prove that islam is the real religion? Or were they actually able to find out somehow? What if I end up in hellfire for eternity? Just the thought of it makes me so scared. I don’t know what to do..\n\nI would love some advice and help.",

Like a red herring I suppose?\n\nLike for example, the first two questions the fellow discusses is “why is violence motivated by religion” and the first question is specific to wars and second is generally about violent acts.\n\nAs for the first question, he answers it by graphing and explaining that only 7% of all world wars that happened were religiously motivated, meanwhile the overwhelming majority was *secular*. That’s the key word to consider. Because in truth, 7% of all world wars are religious, 93% of all world wars are territorial, political, personal etc etc., and 0% of all world wars are atheist driven. What I’m saying is, there has never been a war that anyone has waged to prove that there is no god and that their ideology is right, which has happened in the religious sense, 7% of the time.\n\nThe second question is the same. He says religion causes violence. But he evidences that the most violent humans were atheists. Which is true, but as for their intentions, religious acts of violence infinitely outnumber non-religious acts of violence, as there has literally been no athiest violence act, atleast significant enough to discuss about like this. Basically, of the violence caused by religious people, religion was actually the force behind it. However, of the violence caused by atheist people, there were other agendas other than theism at all.\n\nBut the guy in the video is being logical, it’s just that the truths really don’t support his beliefs so he’s twisting things here and there, and I wanted some sense of community after looking at the comments section filled with yes men.",

  "title": "I made a new argument against god, that destroys any theists' arguments (maybe)",
  "selftext": "**INTRODUCTION**\n\nI made a new argument against the existance of any intelligent creator of the universe, that would debunk a priori every single one of them. Like it would make their existance IMPOSSIBLE from the get go, but there's a few catches:\n\nI haven't seen it anywhere else, that's why i say that is \"new\". This does not mean it actually is. My research might have been partial so i won't swear 100% on it being original. Additonally there might be some oversight on my part on how much the argument is valid, so if you know any better i would appreciate your input in the comments. (there is also a secret catch but I'll write about it at the end)\n\n**ARGUMENT STARTS HERE:**\n\nLike i said this argument tackles the existance of intelligent creators of the entire universe, so mainly any abrahamic religion. The problem is their intelligence. Intelligence, as we know it, allow us to interact with the world with a set of rules that make us create inferences, reasoning, arguments and so on. This can be easly seen this way: we can agree on things and reach the same conclusions. To do this a repeating pattern is occurring that is regulated, in our case by our brain wiring, that gives us the \"rules\" of our intelligence. We disagree but that can be explained looking at the context of the disagareement. Maybe the person is lying or has received wrong information in the past. The rest is done by the cognitive biases of our brain that make us reach wrong conclusions (and mantein them). But when this does not happen we are in the first case, and we all reach the same conclusion thanks to said rules. Example of these can be existance of reddit or that 2+2=4. Example of when we disagree, existance of god and who's really the fault for losing the car keys, John.\n\nSince intelligence requires rules, it follows that god has a set of rules that regulates its intelligence. But who made those rules? God cannot be the one, he works thanks to those rules, so they had to exist before god itself. It means that there must be a creator of those rules that regulate god. At this point the only option to argue for a theist would be:\n\n\"The set of rules that regulate god do not need a creator, they just are\" (1)\n\nbut with this they basically debunked their main argument for the existance of god:\n\n\"the set of rules that regulate the universe cannot exist on their own, they need a creator\" (2)\n\nIf such thing is not necessary anymore, thanks to (1), then their main argument for god crumbles. Because the same exact thing can be said for the universe and it would require less baggage than to buy an extra reality with an omnipotent being in it. So here's the argument last time quickly:\n\n1. Following the logic of a theist, rules requires a rule giver, a creator\n2. Intelligence requires rules to work,\n3. God is intelligent,\n4. God is controlled by rules,\n5. God has a creator,\n6. This cannot be since god is the ultimate being that created everything,\n7. Therefore a being that created everything cannot exist,\n8. God is not real,\n9. If rules do not require a creator, (1 is not true) then the universe does not need a god,\n10. God is an unecessary hypothesis.\n\n**ADDITIONAL OBJECTIONS AND OTHER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**\n\nObjection 1 - One can say that intelligence does not require rules to work at all.\n\nBut with this it means that it is impossible to reach any common conclusion between intelligent beings. We would randomly change our minds without, well, any reason.\n\nObjection 2 - god does not requires rules to be intelligent.\n\nThat means that his intelligence is random, there is no objective standard to which he stands. He changes his mind on a whim, since his intelligence is not bounded by any rule. He would represent CHAOS. Since he is represented as order, this cannot be the case at all.\n\n**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**: The argument is similar to these two arguments in a certain way:\n\n1. \"where morality really comes from, externally from god or god decides morality on a whim, in the first case god is under a moral law outside him, in the second morality is not objective\"\n2. \"The universe can just exists like god does, so god is not needed\"\n\nI think my argument is more defeating than those two because it tackles directly the nature of god, without possibility of escape like in (2) where this argument does not rule out god like mine does attacking their reasoning in a deeper way. For (1) similarly, it does not tackle directly their notion on why god is needed to explain the universe like i did. It doesn't mean i think they do not work of course, but togheter they might be more effective than singularly.\n\n**THE LAST CATCH**\n\nNow the last catch that i promised at the start of the comment: this argument doesn't rule out the existance of an infinite chain of gods that create rules to govern the lower realities. This does still debunks any classical god and as far as i know, no religions adopts the infinite chain of gods, rather, most theists rejects the notion of an infinite chain, so i guess the arguments still stands strong.\n\n**ADDENDUM**\n\nWith this, I guess, I finished my presentation. I am not a philosopher, so, like i said, I might have misused some terms, or applied faulty logic. Secondly, english is not my mother tounge, so there might be some mistakes in the post and my lazy ass doesn't want to check it.",

It seems to be the case that there are some people who claim to be atheist, but at the same time they are basically having the feelings and reactions of a christian radical. \n\nAn example is the defence of christianity that i have seen, when racking down on other religions. Christianity was by them portrayed as a better alternative compared to to other faiths, and the reason was (what at least i think is) the typical christian argument of telling me to look at the christian world, and by that it should be obvious that christianity is better.\n\nI obviously call bs on that. Christianity is not inherently better because it is christianity. The reason christianity is better (atleast in my part of the world)is because the enlightenment managed to reign it in and force it to adapt to normal common sense and decency. It is the enlightenment that has made parts of the christian world better....by reducing the christian influence in it. \n\nI don´t know why these people talk as if that christianity is better. I can only assume they are so ignorant of world history that they confuse the reasons for why parts of the christian world is better.\nAnd when i point this out to them, they get extremely defensive and starts accusing me of being in favour of (insert religion they dislike here) and that i want to let said religion destroy their society. \n\nWhy are some people like this?",

  "selftext": "I stumbled upon this thread and have been reading through some of the discussions out of curiosity.  I would like to have an open discussion on what lead you to believe there is no God, or how you came to that conclusion.  For transparency, I am a Christian and I do believe in God.  I also believe we as humans all have unique experiences and perspectives that inform how we make sense of the world around us. I would like to learn more about yours and how it informed how you answer this question.\n\nEdit: I think explaining my own beliefs will make it easier and to avoid confusion \n\nFirst I’ll explain why I believe in a God, which is different than why I choose to be Christian.\n\nThe current estimated age of the universe is 13.7 Billion years.  This is a long time but still finite.  In infinite time there are infinite possibilities but 13.7 billion years is far from infinite.  Current estimates are that life  emerged on earth about 3.5 billion years ago \nAnd life, especially intelligent life seems infinitesimally unlikely. But it is. We’re here.  \nNow from there there’s two options.  One is life happened by cosmic chance.  If that is the case I think it is very unlikely that Earth is the only place where this happened in the last 10 billion years. And lifeforms are much more likely to create life than cosmic chance in my opinion.  Humans have already shown potential\n\n https://amp.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/15/cambridge-scientists-create-worlds-first-living-organism-with-fully-redesigned-dna \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/life-evolves-can-attempts-to-create-artificial-life-evolve-too/?amp=true\n\n (pretty interesting and kinda scary implications ) \n\nA life form technologically advanced enough would be no different than a god.  If modern humans met Paleolithic humans with current technology they would be gods to them, (planetary destructive capabilities, genetic manipulation, flight, cure disease, artificial insemmination, space faring).  And that is a technological  difference of only 10,000 years. \n\nYes earth could possibly be the first place intelligent life developed organically, but even if it was the second we could have a potential creator.\n\nThat is the discussion this question was meant to talk about.  \n\nAs for my personal beliefs:\n\nI’m Christian but my beliefs of God are monist.  I have had some profound experiences with psychedelics which have definitely influenced me.  I believe God is the entire universe and we are parts of it experiencing individuality temporarily before joining back with the whole.\n\nI choose to be Christian because it’s a fundamental part of my culture and the theological perspective I have the most knowledge of.  As an African American, it has provided resilience and community  for my family in the face of systemic inequalities, and it has been beneficial  for my mental health. \n\nI believe the biblical authors were humans like you and I and were influenced by their own experiences and culture.\n\nI think of religions like blind people touching the elephant.  They’re all feeling different parts of it and will describe it different ways, but it’s the same thing.  Christianity is the part of the elephant I touch.",

One of my close friends is Christian and he's an extremely cool guy, he is like the opposite of what I think of when I think of crazy christians.

  "selftext": "My fellow Non-Believers, Sceptics, Agnostics and Atheists,\n\ntoday I had a showerthought which is pretty much the headline of this thread. My core point is, that the departure of atheists from religious communities can lead to a lack of counterbalance to radical fanatics in these communities.\n\nCommunities serve as platforms for discussion and debate about faith and spirituality. When atheists leave these communities, many critical and skeptical voices are lost that can play an important role in challenging radical views.\n\nThe loss of these critical voices leads to the remaining members of the community being trapped in a bubble of confirmation bias. Without controversial discussions and diverse perspectives, radical views will be reinforced within the community.\n\nThe absence of atheists, sceptics and other secular voices in religious communities leads to a lack of plurality. This severely limits the diversity of opinions and views within the community and inevitably leads to a decrease in critical thinking.\n\nRadical fanatics within a religious community may feel emboldened if they see no serious opposition or critical challenge to their views within the community. This could lead to a sharpening of their positions.\n\nThe retention of atheists in religious communities can serve as a way to maintain communication bridges between different worldviews. These bridges could help reduce misunderstandings and promote dialogue between believers and non-believers.\n\nFor example: I am from Germany and although we're a fully secular state, there are some bonds between state and churches, one the official tax authority (Finanzamt) is collecting church-taxes for the churches from their members directly off their paycheck, two we have 'Religion' as a mandatory subject in schools. I remember well, that in these classes our very religious teacher could never go over the top with her religious mumbo jumbo, because we were a class full of sceptics. She always had to interpret Bible passages as parables; the class would never have let a literal interpretation pass.\n\nAnother important consideration is that boards and committees within religious communities that play a critical role in setting policy and community direction could become lopsided due to atheists leaving. This could result in decisions and resolutions on these boards being made by a homogenous group without the diverse perspectives and insights that atheists and secular members might have brought to the table. The one-sidedness of these bodies could increase the likelihood that radical views would be advanced unimpeded in the absence of critical internal oversight.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nI don't really want to join back to any church or waste time with religion, so this is just a thought-experimant.",

  "selftext": "Science is edging closer to answering some critical questions for us. While on earth, the discovery of nothingness led to the detection of virtual particles, out in space the Hubble Space craft is voyaging and providing us with mesmerising images of galaxies and clusters that no religion has ever mentioned.\n\nMany believers are so entrenched with false claims and there is no point debating. Others are smart or young people seeking answers but find the language intimidating and overwhelming.\n\nLet us share our scientific knowledge of delusions busting facts, following simplified format if possible so we can create a list that’s easy to comprehend. \n\nStart with the religion / religions, name the myth and give its scientific counterpart.\n\nHere is my example:\nRabbinic Judaism, Christianity, Gnosticism, Islam, Bahai Faith. \n\nThe myth: Noah’s ark, nearly 8 thousand pairs of animals housed in ark built by Noah, his family and hired help.  God didn’t offer help in building the ship but angels helped gathering the animals.\n\nScience: first are fossils documenting nearly 8 million animals species and we are still discovering more. Second even with today’s ship building techniques it is impossible to build a floater that could house the animals and supplies lasting 40 days considering the claims that god didn’t offer help in building the ship. Finally despite the wide range of scanning technologies from submersibles, ROV, satellites, sonar and many more, discovered ship wrecks are nowhere near anything the size of the ark Noah is claimed to have built.\n\nPlease refrain from using abusive language. The idea is to offer bullet points to allow those interested in a certain myth to have enough tools to carry out their own research.\n\nRemember to hit the up arrow to make this noticeable for Redditors, and to recommend all knowledge you agree with.",

  "selftext": " I just finished Arnold on Netflix and it’s mind blowing the numbers of life lessons there is in this documentary. Rare for Netflix, usually focus on non essential crap propaganda. \n\nFirst episode focusing on the drive that Arnold develop in life. How he set his goal and push for it and never ever give up hence that’s why he became so successful. Priceless words from his (horrible father) “No matter what you do in life, keep busy and BE USEFUL” That part still resonate strongly. \nHowever, that very success is what makes him but also kill him. I will cover that later. \n\nOn the second episode they focus on his career in Hollywood and how he became a star. By doing the same applying this determination and having clear vision on his ending. This man is a prove that the fate of an individual is never set as long as you’ve got a strong mind. On his personal life too, life gave him a beautiful wife and kids. He said that he was one a rare who was happy professionally and in personal life. \n\nOn the 3rd episode they focus on his career in politics (the most interesting episode) This is where his drive, never enough always conquer for more gets him. Be being a governor he did not see his kids grow up. And that precise moment was key because children needs most attention and care. Also, later her wife learned he was cheated and had an hidden child with the maid. He fucked up on this one, not only for his family, but by not integrating Joseph with the family. Later on his best friend the Italian bodybuilder die. Arnold said that this man was so rare and was the only male he spend time with. \n\nAt the end of 3rd episode we see Arnold going out of gym of his bike. His body language breath kind of misery and sadness. Arnie don’t lie about that he shows everything, he is vulnerable and not fake. \n\nWhat I see is a man who made the wrong choice in his 50’s and now pay for it. From personal experience if you broke it family it’s broke forever. I dont think it’s due to the cheating, but the fact that he was absent toward his kids at wrong essential construction years. Once it’s done, cannot be undone. Same with his best friend, he could chill back and spend more time with him before he die. \nHis greed for more kill him by focusing on achieving he miss the most important unity, love and relationships.\n\nNow he’s 75 and really seems lonely despite his natural good harness. Even though he’s rich, live 3 different successful path having a family and all. But still now lonely, cannot fix something unfixable which is presence with family. All his millions and fame can’t do much to compensate that. You see him taking care of farm animals at his mansion. It’s a way to compensate the absence of his family. I really felt bad for the guy, and through this understood more that suffering is not about rich or poor.\n\nMoral of the story, life is only about choices. If you are aware now, make sure to seek the most important one. And treasure the essentials that life gives to us. Life is way to short to focus solely on success and goals in profits of relationship and love. \n\nI was amazed to see that Arnold was the way he are. Despite his attraction for the macho symbol and visible materialism. Big house, monster cars, big watches etc \nHe is spontaneous authentic and say what he thinks straight out the bat. He is very vulnerable in reality which contrasts with the big guy image that he spread. I can’t think of any celebrities that has authenticity like him. Maybe it’s due to his Austrian roots.",

Your Dharma changes as per the situation at hand, for example if you are a doctor you have a duty to your patient and to confidentiality, but if the said patient has a disease that is highly communicable, you also have a duty to report to the govt and as such save many lives at the cost of your patient's confidentially. Now Dharma would say that you will have to balance these duties and moral responsibilities and do the thing that is best for the situation, which here is to make the call to the authorities.\n\nNow, the fact that the concept is so vague, makes it very hard for people to understand what is moral.

Went for about 5 years then my youngest daughter got diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and a traumatic brain injury from the diabetes not being treated in time. One year later the oldest gets the type 1. Long story short started the Dawkins, Dennet and Hitchens train. Was an ardent atheist for a decade. Had a real rough patch with my family life went outside while at work feeling everything is falling apart and asked God \"bro what do you got for me?\". Totally was a believer from that point on. \n    Here is the rub. I thought for sure I would leave this community but I didn't. I found that actually following what Jesus said I was more like the people in this community than I was like the average American Christian. I love Bernie, I'm pro choice, I watch youth pastors like a hawk, know that the world is 4.5 billion years old and accept Darwin's theory of evolution. The people you can't stand are the same people I pray to change their ways. The no hate like Christian love saying is real. I think American Christianity is good for making atheists. \n     That's my two cents Jesus said don't judge least you be judged.

You will be vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss.”\n\n“Is trans woman a woman? Purely semantic. If you define by chromosomes, no.

It was also not my intent to ally in any way with Republican bigots in US now exploiting this issue.”\n\nI submit that none of this is 'transphobic'. It is a scientists stating facts which happen to be unpopular, and with much less vehemence than he uses to question Theism or Creationism.\n\nAnd for stating this, I'm sure that I will now be attacked as 'transphobic', whereas actually I don't give a shit one way or the other.

  "selftext": "This thought is sparked by the current affairs in the Middle East, which don't look much different that many other points in recent history, but are taking a front page today for obvious reasons. \n\nReligious people, politicians and especially conservative politicians in the West are out in force currently on tirades against Islam, the Muslim world, fretting about taking on refugees and what to do about Palestinians in Gaza, ranging from let Israel handle it, to Nuke them into glass.\n\nDue to the overlap between Atheism and Liberal voting (or more accurately probably the disconnect to Conservative thought and Atheism), Liberals and Atheists get lumped into being \"Supporters of Islam\" in conservative spaces.\n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth. I can't speak for other atheists, but I believe in treating all religions equally. \n\nChristian conservatives around the Western world are all over the place talking about how these religious refugees might be dangerous and how dangerous Islam is. I agree with that. The difference is that \"your\" (the royal you) religion is also dangerous. \n\nThis is not an approval of Islam. This is not a dismissal of the violence and terrorism done by Islamic extremists. But this is what being intellectual honest with the situation requires. The Middle East is a majority Muslim region and has been wracked by terrorism and violence for a very long time. The Islamic religion itself was not the cause of that, but certainly has become a primary vehicle for that violence.\n\nBut here's the thing. It's because the Religion tells it's followers to abandon all reason and logic and take things on faith. It's because it tells it's followers that this life on Earth doesn't matter and that there is another life, a better life, waiting for them when they are dead. It's because the followers give themselves over completely to their Religious leaders and have to hate the enemies that their religious leaders tell them to.\n\nSo yes, I agree. Muslim refugees from war-torn places are potentially dangerous. They may be likely to be more dangerous than the general population. People who are otherwise religious don't get, that they are also more likely dangerous, in my mind, for those same reasons. \n\nYes, there is more violence and terrorism in the Middle East. And yes, where I live (The US) there is far less terrorism and I'd like to keep it that way. But terrorism by the hands of Christians is more common than any other kind here, for the very same reasons that Muslims fall prey to it.\n\nIn my mind, it's splitting hairs and pointless to argue about which religion is worse. They are all bad for all of the exact same reasons. I don't want any of it here. I don't want any of it anywhere. It's a drag on human-kind. \n\nBut I also believe in being consistent and my moral compass (which I don't get out of a book, or from some grifter) tells me that we should help people that we can. My use of reason, rather than fear, tells me that the individuals that actually carry out terrorist attacks are a small part of the population, even among Muslims. \n\nSo I see no reason to single out one religion when accepting refugees or immigrants. We either take all religions or we take none. We could say \"sorry, magical religious thinking is simply incompatible with modern civilization\" but somehow Conservatives call that supporting Islam too.",

  "selftext": "So one christian girl just sent me a text where some christian author “explains” how god allows suffering and hard illnesses because he loves us and that in illness one’s soul purifies and we learn to be humble and patient. \n\nI of course understand that being ill changes one’s whole perspective of life, you totally understand the fragility of life and how little we are. Yeah, you become humble if you for example can’t even walk of have cancer. But there are so many illneses that literally destroy a human being making it ONLY immense suffering, not some lesson because lesson would be to become healthy after some period of being ill. But many people are terminally ill, or get paralyzed for life. So that is not just lesson, that is life long undeserved hard suffering.\n\nSo after that text in which there is a sentence “God sends you illness because he loves you” I literally got physically sick and told that girl that to say that is insane and that christians are fucking insane. And she replied yeah 80% of the world is insane. \n\nMy reply was that christianity spread by force, sword, fear mongering and hard childhood indoctrination. Mandatory belief and threathening with concepts like hell. Millions didn’t choose christianity. And I think by statistics I read that christianity is on the decline and that not 80 % of the world population are christians. What would you answer if by argument someone says “80% of the world is insane.”",

  "selftext": "**Long**  \n**Please choose one “reason” paragraph to read**\n\nMany of you remember fervent belief. Some of you never went through it.\n\nFor those of you dumbfounded that people could possibly believe this crap. Here is insight from my experience as a PhD seeking, science lover who was convinced for decades.\n\nI *really* believed it. Was preparing to be a missionary, and learned a whole extra language to do so level of believed it.\n\nYes, I was raised in the religion, but It wasn’t just indoctrination. My religious obsession was self-directed. My family saw me as the overly religious one.\n\nSo why did I believe it?\n\n**Sorted by reasons**  \n**If too long, pick a paragraph**\n\n**Reason 1** Many aspects of the religion are unfalsifiable. The general existence of some god can’t really be disproven. Prayers answered? Proof of God. Prayers not answered? “You must have had sinful intentions” or “God works in mysterious ways”. The belief is crafted so *every* experience you could encounter seems to confirm it.\n\n**Reason 2** I recognized my own fallibility. I would encounter contradictory topics in the Bible, and it would be concerning. But I would say “I’m only human. Just because I don’t understand, doesn’t mean there is something wrong”. Remember that this worldview includes a super-intelligent enemy (Satan) who is constantly trying to trick you into disbelief. If the Bible seemed wrong, it could be Satan or my own sinfulness tricking me.\n\n**Reason 3** So much of it sounds stupid and fairytale-like, but it only seems that way from the outside. As a comparison consider gravity. Having never learned it, it would sound stupid “things aren’t attracted to each other! Things just fall down!”. Growing up in the modern world though, it seems so clearly true. While religion is false, it is similar. While you believe it’s true, it seems obvious.\n\n**Reason 4** I had strong coincidences regarding important prayers (no details, sorry). I actually valued critical thinking heavily. I avoided defense mechanisms to protect my faith, because if it is true I don’t need to defend it. However, in some of my most emotional prayers, I experienced very, very big life events on the same day that seemed like answers to prayer (events I couldn’t orchestrate). Often we see “signs” that seem like amazing prayer answers, but are actually mundane. I think my coincidences were abnormally rare. For years, when I would have doubts, I would remember those events and think “that clearly proves God is real and in my life”\n\n**Reason 5** We are very capable of cognitive dissonance. I believed in evolution and Adam and Eve. I believed in basic geology, and Noah’s flood. It sounds so absurd, but the beliefs just didn’t clash often. I didn’t actually think about the creation stories often. They are like the poster-child for what Christians believe, but they weren’t part of daily Christian life. In studying the bible I much more frequently studied early Israel history portions (a lot regarding Babylon and Assyria conflicts with Israel). Those occasional times that science and religious history were in my brain at the same time I just excused it away. “Well I know evolution is real. Maybe God picked two of our ape ancestors, breathed a soul into them, and named them Adam and Eve”. I didn’t need to know the answer for how my beliefs meshed. I just needed to believe that it was possible for there to be an explanation.\n\n**Reason 6** Daily life didn’t involve all the contradictions. Slavery in the bible? Genocide? Conflicting gospel accounts? If something was a difficult topic, christians rarely mention it. If something causes you doubt, you mull over it privately so you don’t inspire doubt in others. It was like a weird unwritten rule. In a subreddit like this, you see a huge load of logical issues. As a Christian, you usually discover them one at a time on your own. It takes time and you approach those problems with a lot of bias. You miss a lot of the problems because they require connecting various concepts or far separated scripture verses. When you encounter one problem at a time, you don’t see the weight of all the logical flaws. You just see one issue. When there is just one problem, even a glaring problem, it is easy to make excuses to rationalize it away, or to simply say “I don’t understand, I’ll revisit this problem later”\n\n**Reason 7** I had people I respected who shared plausible stories. Friends and family experienced miracles! Some of them dramatic miracles. And I knew multiple people involved to corroborate their stories! It seemed like really good empirical evidence. It took a long time to realize just how much even the people trying to be honest would embellish. They would hide (or fail to call out) inconvenient facts. They would overstate the miraculous parts. And they would do it subconsciously. This came from people who cared about truth. People who I knew wouldn’t lie willingly. It took a long time to realize that it didn’t mean their stories were true.\n\n**Concluding remarks**  \nRealizing it was all wrong meant realizing I couldn’t believe the most honest people I knew, and couldn’t even trust my own experience. I had to accept much of what I had been through as delusion. It is really, really confusing to determine truth when you can’t even trust yourself.\n\nIt took a build up of many logical problems before I could say “Maybe I am just wrong about how I interpreted nearly every experience in my life ever”\n\nIf you made it here, thank you for reading! I poured a lot of myself into this, so your time means quite a lot to me!",

I think my issue is that I need to feel spiritual without of course being spiritual. And I know atheism isn't just a blanket term for naturalist but I'm pretty well a naturalist as well. So I suppose that is the lens in which I view reality. \n\nThat all said I wanted to ask, how do you maintain feeling spiritual in the natural world? Anyone else ever have trouble with this?

My wife isn't a complete atheist but she is agnostic, and she doesn't teach religion to my kid. \n\nBut, because of the place we live, and her entire family being Christian, (I live in TX, and don't start on about politics and all that because I don't care), all of my in-laws are weekly church going types. \n\nI make the concession of letting my kid go to family gatherings with the in-laws, because I dont want to alienate her from the rest of the family, and family is not all about religion, and Santa and the Easter Bunny are goofy and easy to dispel at this age, but she gets exposed to it at school too sometimes from schoolmates and she comes home to tell me about it. Talking about Cain and Abel and that crap. And I have to dispel all of that crap. But again, there's school X-mas shows and parties and I don't want to exclude her from it, even though to be honest, the Muslim kids don't participate and its okay. \n\nAlso, my kid has ***NEVER*** entered the doors of a church. ***EVER.***  And just last week my SIL asked if I wanted to let my kid go to \"Vacation Bible Camp\" with her cousins and I said no, and she gave me the side eye. And she asked me why, knowing that I'm an atheist, and I told her, \"If there was a god, he/it definitely doesn't give a shit about Black people.\" That shut her up.\n\nI just don't want my kid growing up to think that when they fall upon hard times that some magical sky daddy is going to come save them just because they wish hard enough, and I want them to know that they have to solve their own problems or rely on family.

  "selftext": "This is a thought I’ve had for a while, and I don’t know if it’s been expressed very often in atheist circles. It’s one of many arguments against the claim of an all-loving creator (although I realize the mere lack of evidence is enough of a reason not to believe.) But this is an argument in outright rejection of it. \n\nWe know for a fact that predatory animals/carnivores, such as lions, sharks, hawks, etc. DO exist. God? Not so much. \n\nFull transparency that I’m not a vegan myself, but sometimes I just think, in theory, it’s fucked up that some animals are obligate carnivores. The idea that an animal’s whole existence has to end, so that another animal can eat to survive for one more day, is cruel and unfair. For example, how many total gazelles and zebras have to get mauled for one lion to live it’s full lifespan? \n\nI do think they’re cool animals, and it’s totally not a predator’s fault that’s how they evolved. But it shows a lack of any compassionate or intelligent oversight in their supposed design. The universe is random and indifferent to the brutality of nature. \n\nFrom the scientific standpoint, yes, I understand that they’re necessary to balance the ecosystem and keep populations stable.

We've been through all the ups and downs with each other you can imagine and I'm truly fortunate that where I'm at, work isn't everything. I am definitely the \"crazy liberal\" of the office while everyone else is more right-leaning, in varying levels. My newest coworker is clearly a very devout Christian (stereotypical 'live, laugh, love southern belle... You know the type), but as someone who was raised in the Church of Christ I am familiar with it all and honestly I respected her because she made her faith known through her actions and words but never once has tried to force that on me. I don't believe all Christians are horrible people, but I do believe a lot of them are getting it wrong. I enjoy discussing religion from a philosophical standpoint and have no problem with people that choose to believe in a higher power. \n\nVery long story short, she comes in today just absolutely distraught because she has found out that her granddaughters are on the pill, her daughter is letting her oldest's boyfriend stay over. They're having sex. Her boyfriend is black and my coworker claims \"I'm not prejudiced, I love everyone, but every black man I have known in my life has been unfaithful.\" Her son in law's father who is the one filling her in on all this \"madness\" said that her daughter is part of the\"woke movement\" which my coworker didn't know what that meant and he said \"well she's a Democrat\" and blah blah blah. There's so much more to this craziness.  Basically she said she's going to tell her daughter \"you better get your household and family in order or I'm going to do it for you, and you're not going to like the outcome\".... What the hell does that even mean?? She claims to understand that on judgement day she will only answer for herself and that she just has to give this all to God, but that was a frightening statement to hear and unlike anything she's been preaching lately.\n\nOne of my faults is how non-confrontational I am. It's something I've been working on, but this morning I was almost shaking just because I knew that I couldnt have more opposite beliefs than this woman, but I didn't feel it was appropriate to disagree with her and point out all the ways I think she's wrong when she's literally crying to me. I didn't want to kick her while she was down. We work closely with each other and might for quite a while. I'm a sympathetic/empathetic person. I can understand how tough it must be to watch your kids going down a path you don't agree with, even if I don't share the same beliefs. However I don't agree at all with her reaction. And what bugs me the most is I clearly have given her the impression that I'm someone she can talk to about this stuff and she just assumes I would agree with her (again, that would be easy for her to assume considering our other coworkers aren't that far off). I was careful to not give an opinion either way. I just said I'm sorry you're frustrated with how things are going. I can't tell you how gross I felt tho just sitting there nodding and letting her vent, but on the other hand I feel like arguing with her would get me nowhere and just cause tension in the workplace. Just like I don't like when Christians force their options, I didn't want to do the same. I guess I was choosing my battle, but I can't help but feel guilty for what I chose. I almost feel like next time I should tell her \"Hey, I'm a friend and I'm willing to listen to you, but you should know that we do not share the same beliefs and ideals and I can't support some of what you tell me.\"",

For me personally, religion didn’t give anything and going to church made me feel left out but I’m curious if this faith factor still applies today.\n\nEdit: Now in our required reading, there is a bible verse as well as paragraphs telling readers to stay in touch with their spiritual self to stay happy.

Those people are being manipulated into turning to Christianity for help. Like where are homless shelters located? Next to churchs. The same people I am saying get them addicted then offer to cure them if they convert.\n\nIf you point out they are forcing people into conversion through manipulation common Christian tactics for thousands of years is to label you crazy, insane, or schizophrenic to silence and dismiss you. The scam of that being both Microsoft and Google AI say Christians use fake mental health diseases to convert people, and force compliance.\n\nIt's a giant scam Christian cause homelessness to convert people, if they are found out they try to drug and lock them up as being mentally sick even though you can print a physical history of Christians doing this to people.",

  "selftext": "I realize that this question may be out of season, but I just came across an argument that advocates the use of the phrase \"*Happy holidays*\" instead of the phrase \"*Merry Christmas*\". The argument goes like this:\n\n  \n1. Wishing a person \"*Merry Christmas*\" presupposes that this person conceives and celebrates Christmas the way Christians do.   \n2. Not everyone is a Christian.  \n∴  \n3. We should wish people \"*Happy Holidays*\" instead of \"*Merry Christmas*\".  \n\n\nPremise (1) is acceptable. In Western culture, the expression \"*Merry Christmas*\"  conveys a religious and historical meaning associated with the Christian tradition of celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. However, in a modern multicultural society, not all citizens share the Christian faith (2): some people may be Jewish, some may belong to other religious groups, some people may have no religion at all. Therefore, (3) if your audience is an individual whose beliefs you don't know, or whose beliefs diverge from the Christian understanding, adopting the expression \"*Happy Holidays*\" may be more appropriate and inclusive.    \n\n\nThat argument strikes me as plausible. Still, something feels off. Do you think the argument works? Would you feel offended, as an atheist, if another person wished you \"*Merry Christmas*\"? How would you react? Why does adopting this measure strike me as odd even though I'm an atheist? ",

  "selftext": "So I'd been wondering, given all the crap that's been going on in the world like religious nutjob Mike Johnson getting to be house speaker, would it be viable to have a country that was completely atheist and would you fine folks want to live there?\n\nFor me, I can see sort of three levels of this;\n\n1) Complete and total seperation of church/religion and state. If you are in public office/work for the government (federal, provincial, municipal or even just your workplace safety commitee) there is no outward expression of religion. No mention of \"gawd\" in your national anthem, no calling upon \"gawd\" to guide this council or what the hell ever. As a private citizen you are allowed whatever belief you want. There are also churches, mosques, temples and what the hell other buildings that THOSE PEOPLE pay for themselves, are fully taxed and no special treatment. I.E. when some youth pastor inevitably rapes a minor, they are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and not given some special treatment.\n\n2) Atheism is the official system of the country and is enforced publicly. You can believe what you want in the privacy of your own damn home. No churches, mosques or temples. Nil public displays of religiousness. Heavy fines and imprisonment for contradicting this policy.\n\n3) Atheism is actually enforced. Like if you are not an atheist, you face persecution and ridicule. Probably not viable given \"human rights\" and so on, but let's be honest, there are a whole bunch of countries where this is actively happening with **CERTAIN** religions. Might feel good to get a little bit back for once.\n\nI'm really interested in the opinion of the community here. And yes I know that certain countries like China dn North Korea aren't \"officially\" religious but the Communist Party in the former and the lard ass Kim Jong Un in the latter are held with near-religious fervour. I think maybe Singapore might come closest to a Type 1 that is not ruled over by **COMPLETE** asshats.",

Many of us had entirely religion-free upbringings, so it wasn't from any church. \n\nBut at some point, via media, teachers, or the schoolyard, we were all taught to reject cause and effect and pure random chance in favor of a dumb narrative built on \"luck\". \n\nThat's not to say \"luck\" as a word is not useful. One can say you've had \"good luck\" or \"bad luck\" to describe a *past* streak of negative/positive random outcomes. But what does not exist is a mystical \"luck field\" that influences *future* outcomes.\n\nWhether it is dice or wearing a particular hat to make your sports team win... this mass irrationality around luck is, in my opinion, too commonly accepted... and it deflects people away from critical thinking and leaves them susceptible to cult think.\n\nAnd yet even the hardest atheists I know still fall prey to it.",

  "title": "The story of all religions:",
  "selftext": "Humans are social creatures, that feel a need for belonging. The first religions were based on worshipping aspects of the world that cannot be explained through rationality. \n\nThis was the first step of the development of religions. Humans started worshipping the wind, the sun, the moon, and everything they felt was unnatural to them. This form of religion was not forced, it was honest. Based on the nature of our species, we would expect us to create explanations for the events that create our day to day life.\n\nAs time evolved, we started to worship gods, atributing the elements that we could not explain to them. This was the old form of worship, but delivered in a more fancy way. \n\nI do not believe the people that created those stories were necessarily hypocritical. The creation of those religions has been out of the need of humans to fit in with society, and the consumption of hallucinogenic drugs at that time was at its peak. There was a need to create stories, that other people then took as facts. The greek mythology is a great example for this.\n\nHowever, the religion that started all of this hypocrisy was Judaism. Here is how I believe it went: Because of the period of slavery that the hebrews faced in Egypt, the people that were responsible for the well being of the jews wanted to return to their native land. So the jews gathered togheter, striked the egyptian government and were granted the permission to leave the country. The people were most likely demoralized, so their leaders made them promises of a land that has everything they would need, creating a religion out of their promises. This created the first hypocrisy recorded in history. They later made up rules, a god, and a dogma, for it to work.\n\nThen this Jesus guy came along. Even if a lot of people consider him to be the ultimate example, a god, and someone that would never lie, those people should remember that it is in human nature to fight for things bigger than yourself. He was probably crazy, but not in a way that would make him an invalid individual. In a way that makes him follow objectives greater than himself, and have the audacity to not deny them even to his death.\n\nAfter his death there was obviously no destroying of the second temple, and no resurrection. The apostles gave their life to Jesus though. Just picture yourself in their position.\n\nYou were emotionally invested in an ideal, that never came true. You can't deny it now, because people would stone you to death, and you would make a fool out of yourself and your legacy. So you obviously fight for this dream, because if you didn't, you would go down in history as a coward, a schemer, and somebody that fooled people for nothing.\n\nIslam was an obvious one. \n\nDuring the period when it started, in the now muslim world there were various wars and conflicts. \n\nIslam is a religion that united people under one flag, and Muhammad was able to conquer all of the regions surrounding it. He lied about being illiterate, in the attempt of creating a perfect story, and wrote a book that would serve as the base of islam.\n\nUnlike Jesus, he did not leave place for ambiguity. He carefully crafted the religion he wanted to build, and wrote a convincing story, based on already existing religions that he \"fulfilled\", even if they all have different stories.",

For example, one of the common responses against \"why god sends atheists to hell\" is variations of:\n\n1. [No, they send themselves to hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvPO23_aW3g).\n2. God gave them free will. Therefore, they are freely choosing to go hell.\n3. If they are stupid enough to reject his salvation, then they must have wanted it!\n\nHow's this any different from a rape apology? Let me draw some parallels:\n\n1. No, you send yourself to be raped.\n2. You have a free will to choose what to wear to not provoke a rapist. Therefore, you are freely choosing to be raped.\n3. If you are horny enough to resist their advance, then you must have wanted it!\n\nEven if I were to be charitable and grant that \"yOu CHooSe tWo gO to hEll\" for the sake of argument, that doesn't change the fact that god also has a choice to ultimately send me to hell or not, given god's alleged \"omnipotence.\" It's really pathetic for Christians to pretend that god somehow have to let atheists go hell if they choose to, even though god has far great power in deciding outcomes than an atheist.\n\nLike, don't you think it's funny how they feel smug *how mighty and magnificent as their god is* when it's convenient to their narrative, and *remove as much agency from god*(just so that their god takes no accountability) **when it violates their narrative**?\n\n**ETA: We should call out anyone who use this line of argument that they are essentially being a rape  apologist, so that they wake up to the bs they are spewing.**",

Adolf Hitler also knows displaying himself as an animal loving vegan.\n\n**They tried their best to make sure the people they pretended to love and protect to suffer once they were disappointed.** Yahweh, the former identity of Jesus was too powerless to protect Jews, but didn't allow Jews to forge alliance with pagans. If king Ahab didn't marry Jezebel but solely relied on praying to Yahweh, his nation couldn't even be able to survive until Babylonian invasion. Then in Book of Ezekiel, Yahweh spoke as if he was the one who made Jews to suffer by the hand of pagans because of their lack of loyalty. When Nazi Germany was suffering defeat, Adolf Hiter also did his best to ensure Germans should die with his ambition by forcing civilians into war and destroying all the infrastructure and intellectual heritages of their nation, rather than having German people survive and benefit other nations. Also don't forget Jesus promised to make Jews suffer worse than Sodom and Gomorrah who weren't interested in his street magic.\n\n**They are annoyingly obsessed with micromanagement, and kept making things worse.** Adolf Hitler thinks no German officer knows strategy and tactic than himself. Yahweh never allowed the rulers of Israel to adopt matured diplomatic and racial policies to ensure their survivability. Jesus also didn't allow his disciples to preach religion to gentile sub-humans (such as non-Jewish MAGA cultists) during his lifetime, but it turns out gentile polytheists are way easier to be fooled than Jews.\n\n**They are all criminals.** Jesus was guilty of damaging people's property (by drowning pigs and destroying fig tree), coercing his follower to leave his father's corpse to rot in the house, inciting revolt with all the \"I come with sword\" and \"you have to hate your parents...carry cross for me\" speech, and most importantly falsely claiming that he is the king of Israel which got himself crucified. As for Yahweh and Trump, there is no need for further explanation.\n\n**They are all narcissists.** Jesus prays to himself yo!\n\n**They sexualize their close kin.** Mary is supposedly one of Yahweh's daughter, and Jesus's mother, also Jesus's sister (because they are both children of Yahweh).

The Romans used crucifixion as a form of execution for essentially serious crimes. Look at what happened to Spartacus' slaves who rebelled. So I fail to see how Jesus was crucified for merely teaching morality. At that time when Jesus is said to have lived the Romans were seen as occupiers by the Jewish population and in reality was Jesus therefore some sort of political agitator? I can understand that some governments have strict laws and punishments but lets be honest. The Christians are trying to be revisionists by claiming Jesus was crucified by the Romans just for being a peaceful moral teacher? How does that make any sense in an empire with reasonable laws? In my opinion the real Jesus must have been a political agitator looking to expel the Romans from Jewish soil, he was caught for his political crimes, tortured and crucified as an example to others. So ofcourse other than scamming people for money by the Church, Jesus cult of personality is based on a lie. Thoughts?",

Before, I didn't say anything but I had enough and told she is wrong. I told there are agnostic atheists and some atheists are not anti-religious. I even mention that there are atheistic religions (Buddhism and Jainism) and some atheists believe in the afterlife.\n\nShe screamed at me and we argued literally for two hours straight over the definition of atheist, what does it mean to be an atheist.\n\nShe maintain that you cannot be both agnostic and atheist, that religion means believing in god or gods (she even claim Dalai Lama himself said Buddhism is not a religion, \"just\" Eastern philosophy), and that she never met an atheist who can tolerate spiritual or theist people. \n\nI told her that she is wrong, especially that it is believe **in** god(s), as *knowing* differs from *believing,* Buddhism is a religion by definition, and there are plenty of atheists who think religion can be good thing to have and can be friends with, date, or even marry theists or spiritual people.\nI even mention agnostic theists.\n\nBefore and the weird part, she used identify herself as agnostic, regardless her personal opinions is similar what to agnostic atheists believes (something like \"I don't know if God is real but I don't really believe it\" and simply not believing in anything theistic, she expressed that she thinks it was part of early humans trying to make sense of the world). She's been a huge fan of Bertrand Russell but isn't that well familiar with New Atheism and other branches of secularism. She''s supportive of Harris (she's got his newest book, but is unfamiliar with him as an atheist), Shermer, and Pinker but isn't well-versed in their work. She has a few biology books by Darwkins but never told me her thoughts on *The God Delusion* directly, and seems to dislike Hitchens (I'm assuming that based on her opinions of Mother Teresa and Hitchens' known anti-theist points, but also not directly).\n\nShe now tells me that she refuses to identify anything to do with religion or secularism, as to why she no longer agnostic. She has no label and yelled at me for trying \"put her in a box\". I'm not. I told her that she is wrong about atheism. I am baffled though that she claims that she going to pretend that religion doesn't exist in her world, she thinks \"both sides are crazy\".\n\nThe weirder part is that she recently bought a bunch of books in Buddhism. She always to like Buddhism, but she has mixed feelings about reincarnation, like she wants to believe in it, yet she horribly mocked me (for **years**) for \"seriously\" believing in it. Not true, I was 15 when I admitted I *would like to* believe in another life I was born in Victorian era, after reading novels by Victorian writers. I wasn't truly sure. I also tried to defend myself as I said I fear death and had fun doing spiritual activities (I used to checked out Wicca around that time). She told me that I'm too gullible to think critically. She still doesn't like Wicca/Pagan, as she believes that's for \"morons who should have been Evangelical Protestants\". She makes faces or negative comments if I mention anything to do with Wicca, like how my favorite cafe gets crowded once a month due to a Wicca meeting.\n\nFor the record, I now don't believe in afterlife. I think reincarnation was a soothing idea to cope with death. \n\nWe don't get along, as I am very confident to say she's narcissistic, she won't admit anything she's wrong and gaslights.\n\nWhat are any thoughts on this?",

  "selftext": "Hello all. Ive been a redditor for a few years and have only commented on the subreddits that I've joined, but this is my first time ever posting something. That being said, I'm an active member in my smallish hometown's subreddit and I don't want anyone figuring out that it's me that's posting this (hence this throwaway account I just made 5 minutes ago) so I just wanted to preface all that.\n\nI work in the ER/ED of a catholic hospital that I live 5 Mins away from. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in biology just over 2 years ago and, having only worked in restaurants my entire life (Im in my 30s), thought it would be a good idea to work in a hospital setting to build my resume bc i want to go to med school/ PA school. So I've worked in this catholic hospital for almost 2 years as a tech since it was the only hospital that would even give me an interview. \n\nThat being said, in the interview I was assured they were inclusive of all religions etc. Since I'm a pretty outgoing person, most people know I'm extremely anti religion/ Christianity/ catholicism whatever. I even have a pin on my badge that says \"maybe today Satan\". \n\nFast forward to the event- one of the deacons/priests came to our unit about 10 mins after we had all gotten on the floor and said \"everybody huddle up I have some holy water I would like to say a prayer and bless everyone\". So I kind of snuck out of the area in order to not be around this witchcraft thing. I just went to the nutrition room, grabbed a coffee and waited about 2 mins for it to be done. I come out of the room and I'm walking to the area I need to be in and I see the priest walking down the hall towards me with his potion, spraying the area as he walks along. As I walk by him, he sprays me with it and I go \"are you serious? Why would you do that I didn't want that on me and frankly makes me uncomfortable\". To which he replied \"oh relax you're not going to sizzle up or catch on fire I know you're a good guy\" (he doesn't know I'm an atheist). And then proceeded to splash me AGAIN with this super sacred water. I legit was just in disbelief that it happened and I just stood there for a second and walked to my other coworkers and immediately starting saying what happened and that it bothered me that he didn't ask me for permission nor respect the boundaries I had quite explicitly laid out. My coworkers were like \"he's just trying to bless u blah blah holy water is a good thing\" etc.\n\nAm I overreacting? Probably. I feel like I am but it just seriously bothers me that I tried to avoid the situation and then he just disregarded me asking him to not do that. Yes, I'm aware of where I work and all that but this is a giant catholic hospital network in multiple states and they're accepting of all faiths (or lack of) and so my thought process is what if he did that to someone who was Muslim or Buddhist or something else? I really shouldn't be surprised I suppose though I mean it's not unheard of for a catholic priest to not care about consent with altar boys or anything.\n\nTldr: splashed by a priest with holy water while walking by him at the catholic hospital I work at, asked him to not do that and he proceeds to do it again.",

Just as we approached I saw a crowd in front and thought it was some sort of protest, maybe in response to sexual abuse of kids by priests. But it was people praying, something called the men’s rosary crusade and there were pictures of icons and a statue of Mary \n\nWouldn’t be surprised if these people are the same sort of Catholic thugs that counter protested against abuse survivors and LGBTQIA activists.

  "selftext": "Am I overreacting?\n\nSo today, I was scrolling through YouTube Shorts for some art inspiration. Then I came across this artist, and the short was titled \"This cured my anxiety\". \n\nShe was talking about how she always got anxiety when going to the lunch room back when she was in high school, so she went to the girls locker room (I think), and she prayed to God, asking for her anxiety to be cured. Then she said that \"It worked\". \n\nI looked through the comments, and many people applauded her and saying how \"prayers do work\". One person said how one day they hope that everyone believes in God, because he loves everyone.\n\nAs someone with social anxiety, it infuriates me. I feel like praying is some sort of coping mechanism. It produces some sort of dopamine after praying about your worries. Like praying my social anxiety away never worked, and made me feel even worse. I also felt like that YouTube short was to try and make everyone believe in God. I saw some of her other YouTube Shorts, and one of her shorts said that \"God spoke to her\".\n\nI used to watch her content, as it really helped to improve my art. Like I can't even enjoy YouTube Shorts without having some Christians content disgusied as something I like to watch (comedy skits, art, music, etc) then they talk about how praying to God works.\n\nAnyways, did I overreact?

I knew I was supposed to convince him otherwise with some magical speech, like Jesus would do, but nothing came out.  I always knew that believing in God just made sense, but I could never find any reason for it. That moment, combined with some struggles over the years seriously made me reconsider chirstianity and over time I began to hate those stupid stories in the Bible. It creeped me out how far people could take the act of doing anything for a mere picture.\n\n  Currently the only thing that is left of my beliefs is only the concept of a God, since I am terrified to think about a world without it. I hate christianity, but I still can't insult it because my baptism ties me to it. When I'm in danger or I'm nervous, the only thing that truly brings peace to my pessimistic mindset is praying.

  "title": "In the case of greater centralization in the Atheist community.",
  "selftext": "I. Introduction\n\nOne question that I always hear from Christians is \"so what do you believe in then, nothing huh,\" I usually respond with, \"Well, no, I believe in my own moral philosophy to live a good life,\" past that the debate, or rather one-sided screaming match continues. But Atheism isn't a religion by itself, instead Atheism is the lack of God(s) in a religion, it is a term to describe any religion. Atheism has taken on the role of no religion recently, yet I feel this has only caused pain for the community. Let us not forget that Buddhists and Confucianists, along with many others, are by definition Atheists. The way of no belief, or rather belief in morals is decentralization.\n\nII. The Goal\n\nOne reason I left belief in Christianity is to pursue my own moral and philosophical ideas. I've started collecting them and making a fun little document with all of them. But in this world you are expected to be able to say, \"I'm a Christian,\" or \"I'm a Muslim,\" or even \"I'm a Buddhist.\" Saying your Atheist brings connotations of disbelief or belief in nothing, Atheism therefor cannot be a religion in the public view. For a religion to exist it must have a set of beliefs, yet for each Atheist their views differ. My point here to establish the need for religions to exist in the Atheist community, separating the Atheist community in centralized parts instead of a blob of belief. The main goal is to elevate some religion(s) to the point where they'd be respected on the likes of Buddhism or Confucianism.\n\nIII. How?\n\nI call for a complete work of the Atheist belief system that most Atheists can work with. After that a system or morals and a rebranding of this new Atheistic religion. I'd take the beliefs straight from this sub and use them. My idea for a name would be Novism from the Latin word Novus. Novism would be the embodiment of the the ideals of people in the Atheist community, especially on this sub.\n\nIIII. \n\nConclusionTLDR; Atheism should centralize into one system of beliefs that has flexibility and no God(s). The idea would be to get this religion to a stage where it is accepted while keeping the freedom of its members. The reasoning behind this is due to the success of other centralized Atheistic religions like Buddhism and to give Atheists a centralized voice in the religious community. I highly doubt this would go anywhere, the planning of this would be insane, and most Atheists would laugh it off as \"I left religion to not have any, why would I go back?!\" Yet I do find the need for this idea to be somewhat brought out, maybe not as I envision it.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention this was made a while ago when I was still new into Atheism, I was looking back in my docs and found this I never used, and well, thought to put this up.",

There's no comfort to find in the fact that my atom will exist even after I die, no comfort that death wouldn't be black but simply nothing and unfeeling. I've read about some people talking about reincarnation and such but to me, it's something that seems almost so impossible.

I think that religion is used to comfort people so that they may live comfortably thinking that there's something after death, how I wish for it to be true but there is no solid evidence of god existing. I look at my religious family and friends with pity though a small part of me is envious, never saying anything even though knowing the harsh reality.

  "selftext": "There's a post on tumblr where the OP (who is jewish and was raised orthodox) states that wanting everyone to believe in evolution instead of creationism is *\"proselytizing\"*, stating that *\"your desire to have everyone believe in the same truth you do is a result of your cultural christian upbringing, because you haven't shed your moral obligation to proselytize\"*.\n\nThey also said *\"Judaism's rule against proselytizing for me extends against proselytizing about Western science. I don't do it\".*\n\nWhile they aren't a creationist, according to them \"truth is relative\" and since religious belief is true to those who believe in it, and they respect that. \n\nlink to screenshot showing posts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/14elrk5/this\\_was\\_in\\_response\\_to\\_a\\_question\\_about\\_their/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/14elrk5/this_was_in_response_to_a_question_about_their/) \n\nWhen I confronted them about their stance, asking them what they think of harmful beliefs such as belief in Qanon, antivaxxing and the belief that queer people are predators they said that there is a difference between inherently harmful beliefs such as them and belief in creationism and intelligent design; the latter causes no harm to anyone. \n\nThey say that there are hasidic Jews who are creationist yet still believe in global warming and that protecting nature is a sacred duty. Does that soften the potential harmful effects of believing in creationism? \n\nWould you say that belief in creationism isn't inherently harmful? Since OP is jewish and their beliefs are formed from judaism I would love to hear jewish and ex-religious jewish perspectives on this.\n\nWhile the OP never mentioned it in their posts, it can be safely assumed that they would be against Hasidic schools/yeshivas teaching children evolution. I don't know about other subjects such as history, geography and biology though (although evolution is part of biology). \n\nPersonally, I think that belief in creationism requires cognitive dissonance, especially if you are educated in other subjects: you would have to use mental gymnastics to justify a creationist view of the world if you know anything about geology and biology. That makes it way easier to fall for conspiracy theories such as Qanon or antivaxx. \n\nEdit:\nAlso, I wanna mention that he received an anon who brought up indigenous belief systems, saying \"theres a long history of western scientists dismissing indigenous creation stories only to find some truth in them, so saying all people who believe in creationism are stupid has Bad Vibes to me\". The OP agreed with the sentiment. \n\nBasically, they use indigenous people and their belief systems to justify their stance, implying that mocking and criticizing creationism is disrespectful of indigenous faith systems or colonialist.",

I asked her what makes her beliefs more legitimate than mine, her response was, and this is verbatim, \"it's written in the bible.\" My response was, this is also in the bible, my own bible that I wrote because I am the new Messiah. That sure as shit left speechless. I demonstrated to her that it doesn't matter what your religion is, how many followers it has, anyone can come up with any kind of nonsense and have people back it up, IT ISN'T ANY MORE TRUE THAN THE EARTH BEING FLAT.

I recently had a conversation with a friend who is atheist but believes in ghosts, spirits, etc. She is heavily dismissal of religion and uses terms that, in my language, are comparable to things like \"sky daddy\", and she is basically calling me ignorant for believing in god.\n\nI am not here to debate the existance of either god or spirits, but is it not weird to call christians ignorant while believing in ghosts? I at least think it's rude of her to call my belief system ignorant.\n\nI get that there are fundamental differences in what believing in god and believing in ghosts means, but they both have the same amount of scientific evidence. I also want to mention i am not a creationist, i believe in evolutionand the big bang and am persuing an education in engineering. In case you think i'm dismissal of science.\n\nSorry if this doesn't fit the sub, i just wanted the opinion of other atheists, spiritual or otherwise",

  "selftext": "Me (25 NB) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together for about a year. He's a Catholic and me - well, let's say I don't like religion as a whole and would rather just (not)believe what I want to believe.\nThe problem is, he admitted recently that he has been confessing about us having sex every time he goes to confession (because we're not married). Which is fine I guess, it is what he believes, so I shouldn't interfere.\nHowever, it affected me in ways I didn't expect. It made me feel like he thinks us together is wrong or dirty. I noticed I'm hesitant in doing anything with him since then and if I do, sometimes I feel sad. I also feel resentful towards him at times. Especially when he wants sex and I remember this.\nTo me, sex is a part of the relationship and it makes me feel close to him and it's an expression of my love. I feel like this has been kind of made ugly in a way. I don't get it, because how can expressing your love to someone be wrong? (I get it logically that it is a sin for catholics, but it just makes no sense to me personally)\nMaybe I'm more sensitive to this because of my past relationship with a girl, I dealt with a lot of fighting against feelings of other people thinking our relationship was wrong. I feel like maybe it is making this matter worse.\nWe did talk and he said that he is not sure where he stands on this aspect of catholism. He sounded like he wasn't 100% in agreement with it (it being such a big sin), but that he still confesses just in case. He told me he doesn't actually regret us having sex, but this did nothing to make me feel better.\n\nMy question is, even though feelings of everyone are valid, is this something that makes sense to get upset over? Am I being oversensitive? Should I come to terms with it somehow and get over it? If you have any advice, I'd be really thankful! :)",

  "title": "“Under god” needs to be removed from the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.",
  "selftext": "It was added by President Eisenhower in 1954 during the height of the red scare.\n\nLet me repeat that: “Under God” was not in the original pledge.\n\nWhat a joke??? We are essentially forcing children to pledge their allegiance to god every morning.\n\n**Edit: I did not expect this to hit the front page, if only briefly.**\n\nGiven that this post will likely be found in the future, I want to provide some resources relevant to this debate and discuss the pledge more broadly.\n\nResources:\n\n[This excellent article from Pew breaks down the pledge's history and the addition of \"Under God\" in 1954.](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2013/09/04/5-facts-about-the-pledge-of-allegiance/)\n\n\"**Congress added 'Under God' to the Pledge in 1954 – during the Cold War.** Many members of Congress reportedly wanted to emphasize the distinctions between the United States and the officially atheistic Soviet Union.\"\n\n**Relevant Supreme Court Rulings on the Pledge**\n\nThe Supreme Court case [**West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette**](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1940-1955/319us624) established that children may not be compelled to say the pledge at public schools. \n\n\"In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court overruled its decision in Minersville School District v. Gobitis and held that compelling public schoolchildren to salute the flag was unconstitutional. In an opinion written by Robert Houghwout Jackson, the Court found that the First Amendment cannot enforce a unanimity of opinion on any topic, and national symbols like the flag should not receive a level of deference that trumps constitutional protections. He argued that curtailing or eliminating dissent was an improper and ineffective way of generating unity.\" - Oyez\n\nIn 2004, the Supreme Court heard [**Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow**](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2003/02-1624)*,* a case brought by an atheist who said a California school’s pledge requirement violated his daughter’s rights under the First Amendment’s Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses.\n\nThe court did not rule on the legality of the words “Under God” in relation to the First Amendment, ultimately deciding that Newdow (the California plaintiff) did not have standing due to a lack of custody over his daughter. It was a really bad case and set future arguments against \"Under God\" up for failure.\n\nInterestingly, Justices William Rehnquist, Sandra Day O’Connor, and Clarence Thomas wrote separate concurrences, stating that it is constitutional to require teachers to lead the pledge. \n\n**Relevant Lower Court Cases:** \n\nIn 2014, the Massachusetts Supreme Court heard [**Jane Doe v. Acton-Boxborough Regional School District**](https://law.justia.com/cases/massachusetts/supreme-court/volumes/468/468mass64.html). The case involved a group of parents, teachers, and the American Humanist Association claiming that the Pledge requirement, including the use of the words “Under God,” violated the equal protection clause of the state’s constitution.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Court did not agree. \n\nFrom the decision: \"They argue that, because the daily recitation of the pledge violates art. 106, it also violates § 5. For the same reasons we hold that the pledge does not violate art. 106, however, we also hold that it does not violate the statute. Moreover, as we have stated, reciting the pledge is a voluntary patriotic exercise, but it is not a litmus test for defining who is or is not patriotic. The schools confer no \"privilege\" or \"advantage\" of patriotism within the meaning of the statute to those who recite the pledge in its entirety.\"\n\nDespite the setback, the American Humanist Association wasn't finished. \n\n[**American Humanist Association v. Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District**](https://casetext.com/case/am-humanist-assn-john-jane-doe-v-matawan-aberdeen-regl-sch-dist) was a New Jersey case from 2014 that sought to directly eliminate the use of the words “under God” from Pledges taken at public schools.\n\nThe New Jersey Supreme Court ultimately decided that the state law requiring schools to have a daily recitation of the Pledge did not violate the state's constitution.\n\nNot only did they reject the case, but the decision also uses language that would make any future attempt at challenging \"Under God\" in New Jersey fairly interesting. \n\nFrom the decision: \"Over and over, from the writings of the founders of the Constitutions of both the United States and the State of New Jersey, emerges a faith in, and a reliance and even dependency upon God to help secure the blessings of liberties and freedom attendant upon good governance.\" (*BARF*)\n\nIn 2019, Jabari Talbot, an 11-year-old student from Lakeland, Florida, was [arrested for \"causing a disturbance at school and resisting arrest.\"](https://www.theledger.com/story/news/education/2019/03/06/polk-student-at-center-of-pledge-flap-sees-case-closed/5777369007/)\n\nHer crime? Refusing to say the pledge. \n\nThe charges were ultimately dropped, but the incident reignited efforts to end the pledge entirely. \n\n[In 2020, two DNC caucuses intentionally omitted “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance, sparking a minor controversy.](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pledge-allegiance-dnc/fact-check-the-2020-dnc-did-not-omit-under-god-from-every-pledge-of-allegiance-idUSKBN25M1OO)\n\nAs far as I am aware, that is the entire history of \"Under God\" and the pledge. I hope this helps someone down the line!   \n",

  "selftext": "I started to doubt my original faith (Christianity, Pentacostal) about 2 years ago.  It took a move to another state, isolation, and a lot of thinking to really get that a higher power doesn't make sense.  The first 4 months where I realized he doesn't exist were probably one of the worst extended experiences of my life.  The only comfort was that hell probably didn't exist and that 100 billion people aren't in a pain amplifier for any amount of time (also that hell is actually an english mistranslation for oblivion rather than eternal suffering (go figure)).  Strangely enough, occasionally I find myself hoping God does exist and that he's got my back, just based on how okay my life has been going.  I'm confused, hurt, and still trying to adjust to the idea of a darwinistic and mechanical universe while trying to understand how undeservedly well I'm doing.  I was originally laid off due to covid and jobless for 2 years, survived an extremely bad car crash (someone drove face first into me going 50 mph) without a single permanent injury, and had someone magically swoop in and offer me a job when I stopped receiving unemployment checks and I'd given up, at almost double my original salary.  Despite all this, I've also been extremely emotionally unbalanced and constantly having bi-daily panic attacks since I realized how unlikely god is.  I've been fantasizing about my own oblivion and how great it would feel to stop feeling pain and constantly thinking about about how angry I am at god.  It used to be so easy to have a fantasy that I would be in a paradise in the clouds with my dog and family, but now I'm happy with not existing.  How do I fucking process this?",

Trying to do this mathematically and within the contraints of the outward world view of the Catholic Church. If anyone can take a look at my math below?omework first - this is really complex stuff.\n\n**Background**: Born, Baptised and Convent Educated. I'm almost 50. When I was born, there were about 4 billion people and about 34% were Christian and as is today, Roman Catholics make up the largest number and they are about 0.0001% from the Orthodox flavors.\n\nHypothesis: Catholics have the wrong universal prayer with regards to others - maybe we can solve it imperically?\n\nSo - let's asssume there have been at least 1 billion Catholics on earth every day since 1990. Lets say that at least 1 billion Cahtolics pray at least once a week for an end to war, starvation, human suffering and inequality anjd for Peace and the safe return of Jesus (wherever we lost him). sure how many prayers God answers vs rejects - is it 10%? 50%\n\nSo - lets asssume there have been at least 1 billion Catholics on earth every day since 1990. Lets say that at least 1 billion Cahtolics pray at least once a week for an end to war, starvation, human suffering and inequality anjd for Peace and the safe return of Jesus (wherever we lost him).\n\nSo, here's my rough math:\n\n    52 (sundays in a year) X 1 billion (adherent catholics doing their duty) X (2023-1980=) 43 = 2,236,000,000,000\n\nSo in just 43 years, God who promises a solution to all of the above, which % did he hit?\n\n1. 90%?\n2. 50%\n3. 0%?\n\nUnfortunately, the RC church doesn't keep success rates but the UN has some interesting, topical and up to date data we can potentially refer to:\n\n* Each day, 25,000 people, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related causes. Some 854 million people worldwide are estimated to be undernourished, and high food prices may drive another 100 million into poverty and hunger.\n* According to the World Inequality Report: The poorest 50% of the population own just 2% of total net wealth, an average of PPP $4,100 per adult in 2021. The middle 40% of people own 22% of total net wealth, an average of PPP $57,300 per adult in 2021.\n\nIn summary, God has flatly denied 100% of 2 trillion prayers 100% of the time. I think we have the elephant in the room - clearly God doesnt want us to pray for these things - we're violating the definition of insanity here.\n\nI know that God can't intervene in free will but these things seem more macro level and require some kind of macro level reset - like a world flood, just to bring everything back to basics - or - looking at the bible and punishment, revelations, floods, infanticide, wars, slavery, xenophobia and master race supremacy, maybe we just read the bible wrong?\n\nIn conclusion, if we prayed for more religious wars, more inequality, more starvation, and so on, we'd have a 100% win rate - doesn't it make more sense to just update our moral code and re-align it with the bible?\n\n2 Trillion isnt an accident, it isn't a scale, it isn't a do-over. Its a total rejecion. And thats just 40 years out of 2,000 years.\n\n&#x200B;",

What should be one's ultimate goal in life without belief in God or a higher power?\n\n**Response:**\r  \n\r  \nAs humans, we have EVOLVED to seek meaning and purpose in life through our natural physiological processes. Our hormones play a significant role in determining what gives us a sense of fulfilment and happiness. When we engage in acts of kindness, and altruism, or accomplish personal goals, our brains release chemicals such as endorphins, dopamine, and serotonin, which create feelings of pleasure and contentment.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, our brain's reward system is designed to reinforce behaviours that promote survival and well-being. For instance, when we eat food, exercise, or have sex, our body releases dopamine, which makes us feel good and motivates us to repeat those actions. Similarly, when we help others or achieve success in our endeavours, our brain associates those actions with positive outcomes, encouraging us to continue pursuing them.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, our emotional connections with others provide a sense of belonging and purpose. The love and support we receive from friends, family, and community can bring joy and fulfilment to our lives. The desire for social connection is deeply ingrained in human nature, and our relationships with others can give us a feeling of direction and meaning.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, many atheists find purpose in life through personal growth, learning, and self-improvement. Pursuing intellectual interests, developing new skills, and overcoming challenges can provide a sense of accomplishment and fulfilment. The drive for knowledge and self-betterment can serve as a powerful source of motivation and purpose.\r  \n\r  \nLastly, some atheists find meaning in life by contributing to the greater good. They may dedicate themselves to causes that benefit humanity, such as science, art, medicine, or social justice. By working towards the betterment of society, they can create a lasting legacy and leave a positive impact on the world.\r  \n\r  \nIn summary, atheists can find meaning and fulfilment in life through various natural, scientifically explainable means – from hormonal responses to emotional connections, personal growth, and contributions to society.\n\n&#x200B;",

They believe they are not alone and rely on \"god\".\n\nFor atheists they can't rely on this idea of \"god\", so what do you do to cope when times are tough? I'm sure many of you rely on family and friends (eg. relationships). But what if that was not there as well?\n\nOdd take, but I wish I could believe in god or rebirth, but I just can't bring myself to, I so deeply know that it is infactual. If we could believe in religion, even if it is a lie, wouldn't it improve our quality of life? That comfort and peace of knowing something is always there for us, and all we have to do is just follow some basic rules and pray?",

  "selftext": "I see most of the time people talking about prayer here examine it very one dimensionally. It nearly always gets talked about as making wishes to a sky daddy, which while maybe be funny in a \"I never left 2013\" sorta way, I feel it's massively reductionist.\n\nOfcourse, many prayers are wishes effectively. In some sense all are, but I think that completely ignores the benefit of some practice. We don't believe in a God, so ask \"why would someone pray when there seems to be no evidence of it doing anything?\" And you could answer \"dumb faith\" and while that's not wrong, it can't be the whole picture. People I know who are religious in any way and pray seemingly get more benefits than making wishes. \n\nI think the meditative power of prayer is ignored a lot, definitely by the religious (especially Christians in the West but that's not the world's only religion, or only Christians) sometimes, but especially by us. I think we too easily dismiss it. I think we don't consider the idea that thinking on your problems and saying \"I want a good outcome, but I will accept that there are things I don't control and will accept the world with love\" is actually and incredibly useful skill that any secular person can get behind, and yet because they use different language we discount it. There seems to be an assumption of literalism in their words. That religious people are stupid and couldn't possibly find multiple meanings or effects in things.\n\nWhat do you guys think about prayer and it's many forms? Do you think its worth re-examining? Do you think maybe you should pray in your own atheist way? I certainly imagine my meditation sessions as functioning as a prayer to myself and the world. As a self affirmation to be able to accept things.\n\nETA: I do want to make sure people are aware, I know there's a Christian/Abrahamic bias here in discussing and understanding these things. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about prayer practice across many kinds of religions.",

  "selftext": "IDK if you've never been an Evangelical Christian or a Fundamentalist Christian, but those people... _really_ believe that Mormons are not Christians.\n\nHere's the idea. Eveies and Fundies both adhere to the \"Nicene Creed,\" which affirms belief in the simultaneous equality and difference (I know, and they know, that it doesn't make sense, just go with it) between God the Father and God the Son (and to a lesser degree, God the Spirit). It's just total bullshit, but... It's what they repeat to themselves over and over again _until_ they believe it.\n\nMormons are a branch of Christianity that _doesn't_ adhere to the Nicene Creed. Mormons believe (much more rationally than the niceans) that \"God\" includes God the Father and God the Son as two separate beings. IDK about you, but to me, that's the WAY MORE RATIONAL interpretation. I mean, I can say that only because I am bound by no miserable preconceptions that \"there is one God,\" or something like that.\n\nAnyway, I think that, maybe I'm late to the party, and maybe y'all already think this already, but... for a former Evangelical, like me, this idea was seminal. Mormons are _just as much_ \"Christian\" as are Evies and Fundies.\n\nI guess y'all already knew all that :-p\n\n---\n\n_Edit:_\n\nI love the comments, they're all really thoughtful and I'm trying to reply when I have something to add. I wanted to edit this post to address some of the common ideas in some of the comments.\n\nWhen I was a believer, I was a Christian. And I had that arrogant opinion that Mormons were not Christians. Mormonism seemed absolutely bizarre and alien to me, moreso than, say Judaism or Islam or Buddhism or Hinduism did. That view of their beliefs colored my view of the people themselves.\n\nHere's my bigger fault, though. After failing to believe any longer, I still held onto my religious prejudices. Even after I had concluded that my Christian system was bizarre and ridiculous, I had a special extra helping of incredulity at Mormonism. That is a fallacy. Wrong is wrong. False is false. Mormons aren't particularly more deluded than other Christians. They're all deluded. None can be trusted with the nuclear codes or to fix climate change.\n\nRanking fairy tales is ridiculous, perhaps just as ridiculous as believing them. Yet it was a long time after deconverting before I was able to realize that. Just a piece of leftover baggage. I guess I had hoped that I could give some people a shortcut if they're still dealing with that.",

Sulpicius's contemporaries credited him with a skill in the 'antique' hand. He put it to good use and fantasy was his forte: his Life of St. Martin is replete with numerous 'miracles', including raising of the dead and personal appearances by Jesus and Satan.\n\nAnd also the word for Christian and Good seem to be overwritten in a photo of a critical word from the earliest known extant manuscript of Tacitus (second Medicean, Laurentian library, Italy). in Annals 15.44.\n\nHe also mentions about the James, Brother of Jesus account from Josephus, but I couldn't find any other rebuttal in the FAQ. I did ask some atheists I know and the primary complaint about this account is that there is much less that Josephus says about Jesus compared to other Messianic claiming Jews of that time.\n\n----\n\nThat aside, do you think Matt Baker did a good job in all the other characters? And what impact does this video have on young adults who might consume their historic content from him? \n\nUseful charts, and by extension Matt Baker, is generally regarded as a trustworthy source of many historical timelines, charts and Biblical Historicity. \n\nI won't be surprised if people in the future come quoting this exact video when we (atheists) challenge the Historicity of Jesus.",

Like, I was going to stop liking their music or something? \n\nI suppose I just wanted to hear what people thought about atheists and religious artists in general.\n\nEdit: In this instance, I was talking about a band of Christian people who write normal rock songs about relationships and life, like everyone else. Not like Hillsong Worship. \n\nBut now that I think about it I went to Catholic school and I love to sing, so I was doing school based Vocal  music lessons from when I was in Year 2 (3rd year of school in Australia) and I was even asked to join the Choir in Year 5, when it was just for the Year 6s and 7s. \n\nThen at High School I joined the Choir and then I had something interesting to do during School Masses, and I wouldn't get called up  to be one of the students who was saying a prayer infront of the whole school. I am not one of those people who likes a song because of the lyrics, I'm more into the melody and rhythm. My Singing teacher in high school would tell us not to worry about what the lyrics are when we were working on a song with him because it was just about the voice, and we could be singing \"la-la-la-la\" or make the lyrics up and it wouldn't matter. \n\nSo I didn't care that I was singing songs about something that I didn't believe in, just that I was singing. We were pretty good and we were performing at Weddings and the Credit Union Christmas Pageant, which is recognised as the biggest Christmas Parade of its kind. My singing teacher was the Pageant Organiser and his daughter went to St Dominic's with me. \n\nThe school would often ask Brian to sing at the end of year Mass where they had all the students from R to 12, and they would have a Year 12 goodbye for ceremony at the end. My singing teacher was the Pageant Organiser and h the Primary School and High School were on the same site, but the were separate schools and they had one class per year level of students in the Primary and 3, so 2/3rds of the students started there in High School, like me. \n\nSo the end of year mass was a literal production with a sound and light tech, rehearsals for the Choir, and they brought in metal seating like they have at sporting events for the Choir to stand on and as steps for the R the kids to sit on. So when I was in Year 12 Brian and I sang \"The Prayer\" infront of over two thousand students and parents. The song is actually an \"I wish you all the best song\" - and that's what it meant to me when I was singing it. I was just thinking about how nervous I was - I had never sung solo to a crowd that big before - or since then. 😳 😅 😬 \n\nAnyway, I know myself that I went to school Catholic and graduated as an Atheist ⚛️ despite the prayers, Mass and religious songs. \n\nMy mother lied to a Nun and said that we went to Church because she wanted me to get a good education and she couldn't afford to send me to Private School. My education and all the other experiences and opportunities that I had through that School just showed me that I could be friends with people who had different beliefs from myself, and how to get the most out of the situation you're in.",

  "selftext": "I have noticed this pattern where many of the people I know who are incredibly well adjusted and are able to cope with a lot of difficult things happen to be religious. I can see how having faith in something bigger than yourself would help guide you through life. I really have gone through several phases of trying to force myself to believe in god for this exact reason. Every time, it felt like I was faking it. I was raised in Catholicism and from the time I could remember I always felt like religion was a performance for me. I never really believed in what I was taught in catechism. I assumed it was all allegory and stories and something we did for the ritual of it all. I thought it was an open secret that nobody actually truly believed in God but we all just were faking it until we made it to heaven basically. I always wondered what would happen if heaven was actually real. I would picture being asked at the pearly gates whether I was a true believer my whole life, and wonder if I could lie convincingly enough to get in. I still compulsively prayed because I was told I needed to or else I would go to hell. I honestly feel like all the praying I did was just some glorified version of OCD. I stopped going to church when my mom stopped forcing me to and I pretty much dropped all my religious baggage as soon as that happened. It wasn’t a conscious decision, it just felt like a relief to get out of that situation so I did. As my life gets harder and I get older though I can’t help but feel like I need some sort of life raft to hang onto or else life is so hopeless. I don’t believe in a higher power who has my best interest at heart. So it feels like everything is unpredictable. It may sound really pretentious but I feel like I am too smart to be tricked into believing something that I have no evidence is real. I cannot operate on blind faith. I can’t just read the Bible and believe it is true. It’s not in my nature. And I think this is one of the reasons I’m so depressed and anxious. But when I tell people this, they either tell me to find peace in the nothingness, practice positive nihilism (I’m really trying) or to just force myself to be religious until I actually believe it (doesn’t seem possible and sounds quite unappealing). They’re like, just read the Bible maybe you’ll change your mind! Or my favorite one, just give yourself to Jesus and he’ll catch you! It’s almost like they miss the whole point. They hear me say “I wish I was religious” and think it’s as easy as snapping your fingers. It pisses me off that people just don’t get what I’m saying. I 100% mean it when I say I know myself and at least for now I can’t believe in a higher power even if I desperately want to. The closest I have come to being religious is referring to “the universe” during my Crystal tarot card phase, and used to think everything that is meant to be will be. I used to think I was agnostic and just couldn’t sort out what my beliefs actually were. But I don’t honestly think I believe in anything. I often wish I didn’t seek “truth” in everything. I wish I could just believe in something without question. I would be much happier. Does anyone else have this internal struggle?",

  "selftext": "I've written an article about the origins of Saint Christopher on my social media for my followers. Although I am an atheist, I am very passionate about history, culture, anthropology, and now more than ever, about religions and mythology.\n\nThis is the main part of the article that I'm putting in as a spoiler, just in case you want to read it to understand that I have not offended anybody or accused someone:\n\n>!\"In the world of art and religion, there exists a hidden connection between monotheism and paganism that may surprise you. Despite identifying as Christians, Muslims, or Jews, your traditions bear the influence of ancient pagan practices. Throughout history, monotheism has struggled to suppress paganism during its expansion. However, pagan religions held deep-rooted traditions intertwined with cultural and ethnic identities, akin to a modern passport. In ancient times, meeting someone new meant sharing not only your name and origin but also your chosen deity. Pagan gods represented specific cities, places, banners, and armies, reflecting personal and cultural identities. When monotheistic religions emerged, eradicating pagan customs proved challenging. Instead, Muslims, Jews, and Christians absorbed and reinterpreted pagan elements to align with their beliefs. Muslims incorporated local witchcraft through amulets like the Hamsa and Nazar, while Jews integrated ancient Mesopotamian deities into their practices. Christians transformed pagan deities into \"saints,\" reinterpreting worship of local gods and goddesses as devotion to martyrs who fought for Christ. This led to unique figures in Catholicism and Orthodoxy, such as Saint George replacing the god Mithras, or female goddesses finding representation in icons as Holy Mary. One intriguing figure is #SaintChristopher, venerated in Orthodox and early Christian traditions. His iconography originated from a story during ancient Rome. The tale revolves around Reprebus, a man captured by Romans and forced into military service. Depicted as a colossal figure with a dog's head, Reprebus embodied prevailing beliefs. He later embraced Christianity, became a martyr, and is portrayed as a dog-headed man who repented, received baptism, and devoted himself to Christian service as a soldier saint. \nObserving the iconography of Saint Christopher today leaves a better impression of the amalgamation of paganism and monotheism. It becomes evident that the figure of Saint Christopher is a reinterpretation of the ancient Egyptian dog-headed god Anubis.\"!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, here is the problem - an African guy wrote this aggressive comment. I took a look at his Facebook profile, and it's full of Muslim content. He's Nigerian, and in his bio, there's a mention of an Islamic orientation secondary school. I'm white European, but I have had many Nigerian friends in the past, and one of them warned me about people like him. He mentioned that they have many problems with Islamic terrorism, and many of these people look like \"normal people\" outside, but behind closed doors, they do crazy stuff. So, I don't know what to say or do. This is the complete comment:\n\n\"I read that you said when the monotheism emerged.  \nPoint of corrections, the original faith of humanity is pure monotheism(Islam), peganism and other religions were created after someone they follow as there hero or something they think it's God, see Judaism from Judah. Moses taught them Islam, Christianity from Christ, Jesus taught them Islam, and all other pegan religion alike, named after some heros and heros,. The first human according to the holy books worshiped only one god and did not part in witchcraft and the rest of magics , and when his descendants part with the devil and began to disbelief God keep sending prophets to them to guide them to his why and some believe and some refused to , and it continued like that when people disbelief God sent a Warner and a guider. And mind you Islam did not incorporate with any kind of magic, Islam a pure monotheism, and who ever incorporate with any type of witchcraft among the Muslims is not a believer he just answer name. Unlike the Jews who learned magic and even accused Solomon of using magic to rule , Solomon who was rightly guided by God and a prophet of god to humanity. Paganism have never been the belief of the first men , but people later come parting up with the devils and they teach them magic,. Don't write on what you don't know.\"\n\nI haven't included the offensive words, menaces or other stuff written to me to avoid creating other aggressive reactions or risking getting banned from Reddit.",

While all the anti-fascists supported me then, I could not help but notice that SOME, NOT ALL of those anti-fascists, pretending to be \"leftists\", \"Marxists\" and all that engaged in some form of preaching or GENTLE YET VISIBLE promoting of their religion. I did not like seeing this on my feed. \n\nAll these self-proclaimed pretentious \"leftists\" began clapping hands when I strongly opposed the majoritarian religion (my family belongs to the majoritarian religion and we have always been liberal-minded and against hate). But when I kept making generalized statements about religion, they went quiet each time. One word for such people? Bigots. \n\nToo many of these folks are liars. These bigots are no different from the bigots of the majoritarian religion. What offends me is that these people claim to be anti-fascist or left-leaning. What a joke! THE CONSCIOUS choice an adult makes when they CHOOSE not to see the dark side of their favourite religion ... Leftist? Really? \n\nSo what you are saying is that, as long as your religion does not oppress you and only oppresses someone else, you are okay with it? How are you different from a right-winger who openly engages in hate-speech? Maybe your volume is low because of the reputation you would like to maintain. Or because your religion is the minority religion here. It takes a hell lot of self-control to tolerate these liars! \n\nThe answer to my question, the answer I can think of: religious people will always be the way they are. Religion is extremely personal to the highly religious, no matter how quiet or loud they are about it. When you oppose a religion they are not attached to, they can use their critical thinking skills. But when you criticize the religion they favour, they would feel like it is a very personal attack aimed at them, like you are attacking them personally, like you are insulting and shaming them. That is how sentiments work in general, and religious sentiments are some of the strongest sentiments (given how many billions of minds religion has successfully manipulated and can still keep it going). \n\nYou can only control your actions, not others. As we all know, liars and bigots are not people you can find only in select communities. You can find such people everywhere. They are just doing what any religious person would do, their values might be left-leaning but they somehow can't see the ugly side of their own religion (just like any other religious person on the street) because they do not want to see the ugly side of what they love, of something that is very close to their hearts. \n\nYes, your anti-religion statements will offend them. Yes, your anti-religion remarks will be extremely hard to digest for them (just like their preaching is for you). Your atheism will disgust them (just like religion disgusts you). There is nothing you can do about that.\n\nBut if the only way to get them to stop displaying their bias because it disturbs you is to confront them, then do confront them. Yes, you might lose their friendship, but if it is a must for them that you tolerate their preaching or bigotry to keep the friendship alive, they are just like all the highly religious folks you have always stayed away from.

And yet, in the bible, the Old Testament condones it, sets out how to do it properly, and even Jesus, in the gospels, seems vaguely in favour of it (certainly not the righteous anger you might expect him to have)\n\nHe literally healed a Roman shoulders sex slave, so they could go home and engage in relations with him!

  "title": "Atheist Saving Souls?",
  "selftext": "Someone had asked me to post this here. This occurred in the early 2000s.\n\n(kinda long; stilted philosophy terminology usage)\r  \n\r  \nMy friend, K, had been seeing a psychologist for some time to work through her gender identity issues. That eventually led to her being diagnosed with “gender dysphoria” and the later decision to transition. In her mind, being able to give a name to what had caused her so much angst and anxiety in the past was a weight off her mind. She began to more fully explore her gender identity with the local LGBT support groups, which relieved her even further. She was accepted as a complete human being without precondition or expectations.\r  \n\r  \nShortly thereafter, she decided to inform her pastor about her gender dysphoria and plans to transition. At that point, all hell broke loose. She was expelled from the church. She was openly castigated as a “sinner.” Her and her wife were forbidden from ever attempting to return to the church. Their friends from the congregation shunned them entirely, refusing to talk to them or even acknowledge their existence. Phone calls went answered and they were disinvited from social activities. And they were suddenly alone.\r  \n\r  \nK was devastated and could not understand why her “friends” were reacting the way they were. In K’s view, informing her pastor about her gender dysphoria should have been no different than saying she had a heart problem. She was trans because of a medical diagnosis (there’s even a diagnostic code!), not one of those “depraved hedonists” or drag queens that she saw on Fox News.\r  \n\r  \nOne could stop here and point out that this is face-eating leopard territory, and you’d be right. But the sudden and dramatic shift in her entire social structure and employment status, her entire worldview—all at once—left her suicidal.\r  \nShe called me to meet for lunch and I invited her over to my house instead. When she arrived she was still having a hard time reconciling her situation and was quite despondent.\r  \n\r  \nMany years ago when talking with a friend of mine (philosophy professor) we would use the terms “god concept” and “god object” to separate statements about what people say their “God” thinks (the former) vs. the actual existence of “God” the entity (the latter). In time, “god concept” became the placeholder for all of the religious doctrines and dogmas, the rules and beliefs, and the ridiculous rituals—all the stuff necessary to please their “god object”. The “god concept” can even be completely disconnected from the “god object.” In the Judeo-Christian universe, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all have the same “god object” in mind, while each of the sects has a different “god concept” (complete with a set of dietary restrictions).\r  \n\r  \nI shared this with K and it made sense to her, so we went with it. The subsequent discussion with K focused on reconciling her reality with her “god object” and “god concept”. Leaving her hate-church for something more humane did not mean having to compromise her belief in “the loving God” she’s known all along. She discovered she had agency in deciding which “god concept” to associate with her “god object”. At the end of the day, everything had to reconcile: Her reality (her trans identity), her “god-object”, and her “god-concept”. If they don’t, then something isn’t right.\r  \n\r  \nShe began exploring other religious options and we continued to have many more far-ranging conversations. She eventually found a much more inclusive and accepting church and found a much more positive outlook on life. As far as I know, she is still happily married to her wife.\r  \n\r  \nIn subsequent discussions with religious adherents, I’ve found that the use of “god object” and “god concept” have been effective with understanding people’s positions on religion, especially those who really are struggling with questions about faith and belief. And this is true, even if I’m just using it in my head to track a conversation. As with my friend, it allows one to break down what it is that holds their world together without having to sort everything all at once. They can consider what is essential and what isn’t.\r  \n\r  \nReligious folks would likely refer to this as “moral relativism”. And it is to a degree. At the end of the day, the one person we always have to live with is ourselves. By my nature, even if I did believe in “God,” I could not subscribe to a sect that told me who to hate, who to persecute, and who to kill. And I at least have agency in what “god concept” I’m willing to adopt.\r  \n\r  \nFor K, it was never about turning her into an atheist. She never proselytized to me and I have little interest in the religious beliefs of others. It was always about treating her as a complete human being—as a friend—and showing there is a wider world to be had.\r  \n",

  "selftext": "This post is more of a quick, funny/cynical thought/opinion. No need for analysis or serious consideration. \n\nOut of all the atrocities of the Biblical God (and mostly the one from the Old Testament), I had Noah's ark pretty high on my list. Not too high, there are several things he did that are way more horrible, but, yk, I also had that one in mind, like, \"Damn, God killed everyone\". After reading the parts from Genesis though, I actually thought like \"oh, never mind, fuck em\" lol. Like, it says that evil spread everywhere and everything. Obviously that's an awful generalisation, with evil being based on what's right by religious standards, but if we look at the imperfect nature of humans, it's not that bad of a generalisation. Maybe they weren't too nice anyways, maybe they stinked. So, God created them in the first place, he did it, well, whiping them out isn't that bad, I mean \"oh fuck, I don't like what I made, let's erase it\". Don't blame him. \n\nI think this is partially related to my atheism anyways. In the end we're all just sperm habiting a rock. There is no right or wrong, fair or unfair, in reality. It's all made up. So it's not like us humans have any vital meaning outside our own interest. So, fuck it, God deleted them, kinda genocidal, but fine by me. \n\nObviously the whole story is bs + it really shows how the Old Testament God is more of an asshole with human characteristics rather than the all powerful perfect being, but yeah, it's just that as I read it, I'm like \"oh, well, not that tragic/crazy from one point of view\"",

  "selftext": "Following a very good recommendation, I must edit and  this\n\n I am not a psychiatrist, psychologist or addiction/substance use specialist, nor have I ever been diagnosed or treated as a substance use patient.\n\n What I am posting is all my opinion and observation, I'm sure many will disagree, and that's fine \n\n**Greetings,** I take the liberty of putting my first post here, it is about an idea that has always been bouncing in my head, and that I am considering analyzing and studying in more detail, I come to you to see what ideas you can contribute to what I think.\n\nThe human being is an entity that always seeks eternal satisfaction, unlike animals, who live their lives with what happens day by day, we seek to rationalize everything, we give a moral weight to everything, and we always end up focused on look for \"The Good and the Satisfactory\". It is difficult to explain to people that in order for you to understand that something is Good, you must know in contrast that there is something bad.\n\n**Can you imagine living in a world where there is only satisfaction and happiness?**\n\nMany of the addictions of the human being come from the need to look for a shot of pleasure or happiness that we once felt, and when we return to the sad reality, we do not accept the fact and we go desperately to seek to repeat this Satisfaction. It is a clear definition of **Addiction**.\n\nI firmly believe that religions manage this behavior of human beings to capture and hold their parishioners captive, based on a disastrous and empty promise, ***ETERNAL HAPPINESS***.\n\nHuman beings live a very difficult life, like any animal in this world, some suffer more than others, there is no justice or equity and this brings many frustrations to people. And this is where the ***Malevolent Machinery of Religion*** comes in. The offer is simple, you live a life of misery on earth honoring your God and behaving as we tell you to do, and when the inevitable moment of your death arrives, your Immortal Soul will be able to live in ***ETERNAL JOY AND SATISFACTION***; Fail in one of these things and you will have an Eternal Life of ***SUFFERING AND PAIN***.\n\nThe addiction to satisfaction and joy of people is so big that they end up smitten by the proposal of religion, what are 70 years of servility and dedication to a religion who does guarantee me an eternity of Satisfaction?\n\nAnd with this perverse premise, the religions of the world take advantage of that ***Human Addiction for Permanent Satisfaction***. Like any cocaine or meth addict, they will give up their wages and savings to get satisfaction, they will sell their conscience and their family for their drug, and if their closest loved ones stand between them and their promise, then they will walk over them without any hesitation.\n\nThis being so, in theory at least, those of us who face the misfortune of the world's religions must act towards them as we would act towards any drug dealer; of course there are no laws that favor us, but at least, we must take away the power they have over the ignorance and the Addicted Need of their parishioners, cutting off their supply of clients; and the best way is by promoting the education of all, the more educated the people are, the less likely they are to fall into the bigotry that these perverse religious institutions promote.\n\nAs I said, it's just a group of ideas that I had in my head for a long time and I express them here in a messy way, excuse me for that, I hope to hear your ideas on the subject, don't be afraid to express anything, I don't have delicate skin and I won´t feel offend by any comment, no matter how offensive it may be.

  "selftext": "The fact that I am an atheist made me believe that the afterlife does not exist. I know it seems logical, but it's important for the rest. I believe that when you die, there are no thoughts, no feelings, no nothing. Which for a lot of people seem impossible and absolutely scary, but not for me. \n\nEmptiness for eternity is a belief that I live by.  You know what? I think that the idea of an afterlife scares me more than the idea of nothingness. Paradise, hapiness forever? But can happiness exist without sadness? I do not want to have something perfect forever, I think it would make me, not really be me. The paradise, christian paradise, the bundle concept of eternal hapiness. However, wouldn't you have to have some kind of mind control on yourself for that to exist? You would have to forget those who haven't made it. You friends and family, that haven't been good enough. If you didn't, you would be sad, which would be paradoxical in Heaven. You would scrap the mood of those around you. So you can't remember them.\n\nHell, torture forever, no thank you. No more thoughts about it.\n\nReincarnation: Do you really want to start everything over again? All of the boredom of life, childhood, school, all of them. Without memories? Would it even be you? I mean, memories are what make of a human what they are. Memories shape you into what you are. Your traumas, your education, and experiences are what make you a person. If you hadn't been raised by the parents that you have, haven't been friends with \"those' people, would you be there today? The response is probably: no. At least I would not. So would you be you if you started everything over again? No afterlife seems correct.\n\nThen, there is the concept of forever. Forever? Forever is a hard concept to grasp for a human being's mind. 80 years is the average lifespan. Yet, it feels long. I am at 17 years into it, and I know that it feels long. But eternity.  It is scary. No human can fully imagine what it is like. Centuries, millennium, million of years! In Hell or paradise. It seems... horrible! \n\nAlso, I believe that the fact that our mortal life is doom to end is what makes it so meaningful.  It's because there is an end to it that you make the best of it. If you thought that it would last forever, it would become boredom. Why would you do something when you have eternity? Why would you bother when you have all the time in the world for it? It's like the concept of procrastination in some sense. It would become a litteral cycle of undying. \"I would do it later.\" Nothing would be accomplished forever. An afterlife would be scary because of its inevitable routine. Nothing would make sense.\n\nTo wrap everything up, that's kind of the meaning of the Ying and the Yang for the Chinese. The concept of dualism, the belief that the force of the universe is opposing themselves. It's like two pieces of the same coin.The bad and the good. The night and the day. The sadness and the happiness. They are all a part of a whole. They can not exist without each other. They balance each other. Humans want only the good part, the day, the light, and the happiness.  They want to leave behind the bad part, the night, the darkness, and the sadness. Without seeing that without the bad, you can not have happiness.  If there were only hapiness, you would have nothing to compare it. You would not understand what is even happiness. It would become a dull feeling. It's like when you are so much in a situation that you see no endpoint because you don't know life without it. \n\nSo this is why I am an atheist. The concept of forever and afterlife do not make sense to me. If someone agrees with me, manifest yourself, please!",

But then that just kicks the question further back. Maybe this was the region that had the most people when those progenitor religions were started?\n\nWith everything happening in Israel/Palestine, it reminded me of how Jerusalem and Bethlahem are important locations in Christianity. I'm immediately wondering why the 'authors' chose that location? Why not Rome? I think the roman empire was the biggest population on earth around 0AD (based on a quick google search). Would it have been too obvious? Like they wanted a place far enough way that nobody could check if the stories were true?\n\nBut then, that can't be it because we have a modern religion founded by an obvious con-man which millions of people believe (mormonism).\n\nAnyway, I'm wondering if someone more knowledgeable on this topic than me can cast some light.

  "selftext": "The core of my values I have a principle to not hate anyone who doesn't do anything bad to others, but if someone is stepping on someone else's choices or liberty for religious reasons, that's a hard pass and fuck people who do that. I basically just want everyone to live in peace, because I love humanity and individual people. I've been born orthodox christian but for a while I've been a religious sceptic, later an agnostic and both antitheism and radical religion (proselytizing, forcing worship on someone else, etc) have been against my values, but I was okay with religion itself as I know it gives some people comfort and purpose in life and all that jazz. However, while some modern religious leaders are behaving properly, modern religious people as a whole usually don't: religion was historically used to control people and make them obey their monarch, and it worked fine, but in the age of secularism the religious are carrying ideals of the past eras into the 21st century, feeling uncomfortable around, stigmatizing or even downright assaulting LGBT+ people (or sometimes even worse, women), and using hollow religious principles as reasons, as well as putting old people above morals and principles for no better reason that they're old. My mom personally told me that \"homosexual relationships don't have the same connection as natural ones\" and that homos are just incels who can't get normal relationships. I am bi and I know she's completely delusional, and her head is filled with superstitious bs she's using to explain everything in life, but this is just one person among billions. \n\nLately, I found myself questioning wherever religious people even deserved being respected, drawing the connection between cultural conservatism and religion, but religion is different and I am sure it's really not that simple. Which religions imply mysogony, queerphobia, and other unreasonable stigmas against people? I know muslim as a whole is definitely mysogonistic and doesn't deserve shit, but what else?",

  "title": "The Gospel of Afranius provides a retelling the New Testament without any miracles or supernatural events.",
  "selftext": "The Gospel of Afranius is a book by a Russian biologist who took up Josh McDowell's challenge that the New Testament story has to be historical fact and involves miraculous. The author, Kirill Eskov wrote a fictional story that incorporates all the elements and \"evidences\" from the Gospels into a compelling story that requires no miracles, extraordinary events and has fewer plot holes than the NT itself.\r  \n\r  \nThe novel gives a dramatic retelling, through a story of the character Afranius. In the story Afranius is the head of Pontius Pilate's \"secret service\" who successful manipulates Jesus Christ and the apostles to pacify the restless Jews through the creation of a new religion and messiah that is more friendly to the Romans and less likely to violently rebel.\r  \n\r  \nFrom the wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Gospel\\_of\\_Afranius\r  \n\r  \n*\"The Romans are concerned with the violent opposition to their rule from the factions associated with the religion of Judaism, and design a plan to create a new, more pacifist local religious movement that would weaken the dominant Judaism factions while being less antagonistic to the Roman rule. For that purpose, they choose a new sect organized around Jesus Christ as the most suitable to their goals, and infiltrate it with an undercover operative (Judas), tasked among other things with spreading miracle stories like Jesus' walking on water by pretending to have eyewitnesses them...*\r  \n\r  \n*Meanwhile, John the Baptist, seen as a competitor to Jesus, is executed. The Roman plot culminates with the Roman agents staging two fake resurrections (first of Lazarus of Bethany, second of Jesus). The plan succeeds at discrediting the rabbinical court and deceiving the apostles who became convinced they witnessed a series of supernatural miracles, while in fact what they have seen were staged events orchestrated by paid performers and Roman agents\"*\r  \n\r  \nSince there are no contemporary or adversarial sources to the Resurrection story the author uses only the NT itself as a source. The novel does a great job of incorporating all the \"facts\" given in the NT including why the women and apostles did not at first recognize the resurrected Jesus - because he was a body double! \n\n&#x200B;",

  "title": "Muslim Argument: If Muslim states enforce Hijab upon women, then Western countries also impose restrictions on public nudity.",
  "selftext": "Please help to provide Muslims with a better answer to this objection.\n\nWe (ex-Muslims) have to very often face this argument from Muslims. And we normally counter this argument as under:\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe issue with some Muslim preachers is their denial of the \"Evolution of Dress,\" which is a factual phenomenon. The evolution of dress began as a response to weather conditions, as our ancestors migrated to colder or hotter regions. They needed clothing for protection against extreme temperatures, while modern humans lost their body hair, leaving them vulnerable to the elements.\n\nOver time, the way people dressed became a symbol of status, with women from wealthy families covering themselves more, while women from poorer families or slaves often remained naked or partially clothed. This evolution eventually turned into a fashion trend.\n\nThe question arises: Why do Muslim preachers solely use Western countries as their example? They should also consider indigenous tribes (link) that have practiced Naturism (i.e. a lifestyle of practising non-sexual social nudity in private and in public)  for thousands of years. These tribes move naked in public without any dress, yet they maintain strong family systems without constant issues of molestation due to nudity.\n\nYes, the Muslim preachers first have to answer why it is not an issue in these tribes to move in public without a dress, and why their women were not molested and raped.\n\nWestern countries, too, have experienced a gradual evolution of dress. Influenced by the Christian religion for centuries, many Westerners still adhere to conservative dress codes. However, there is a growing movement of naturists in these countries, leading to the establishment of hundreds of nude beaches where nudity is completely normalized.\n\nIn Denmark, nudism is permitted along 4,500 kilometers of coastline, and the same applies to other Scandinavian countries.\n\n# Naturism in Western countries is totally different from the Islamic forced nakedness of slave women and their rape:\n\nNaturism is not about sex, but it is based upon respect for humans and their choices.\r  \n\r  \nNo one can force a woman to become topless or nude. And forget about rape, no one is allowed to even touch a woman without her consent. \r  \n\r  \nNaturism is associated with absolutely no evil. \r  \n\r  \nIslamic preachers who blame Naturism for the rise in divorce rates in Western countries are mistaken. Indigenous tribes have practiced Naturism for centuries and still maintain strong family systems and successful marriages.\r  \n\r  \nThe actual reasons behind the increasing divorce rates in Western countries differ. Advancements in technology and societal structures have made life more manageable for people, reducing their reliance on family support. This convenience has contributed to the higher divorce rates. If challenging times were to resurface and people once again required family support for survival, the family system would naturally strengthen once more.\r  \n\r  \nThis is evident in Gulf Muslim countries where the divorce rate has reached 50%, even surpassing some Western countries. Despite practicing no Naturism and adhering to full Hijab, the high divorce rate is attributed to the fact that people in these affluent Gulf countries do not necessarily rely on strong family systems to sustain themselves.\r  \n\r  \nThe tribal system, much like the family system, was robust in the past when people depended on their tribes for survival. However, in modern times, especially in cities, the tribal system has diminished as society no longer requires tribal support to survive.\r  \n\r\n\n# A Counter Attack upon Islam Regarding Public Nudity:\n\nIslamic preachers make the argument of public nudity against us, but they forget these realities:\n\n* It was Muhammad who made slave women move in public topless. There were thousands of slave women present in front of Muhammad with naked breasts.\n* It is 1300 year long history of Islam where slave women had to stay topless. Umar Ibn Khattab used to beat them with a stick for taking Hijab and told them not to resemble free Muslim women by taking Hijab.\n* And Islam turned poor slave women into sexual objects, and Muslim men were given licences to fulfil their sexual lusts by raping them. They were presented in that naked state in the Islamic Bazaars of Slavery, where Muslim customers were also allowed to touch their private parts (just like sheep and cattle are groped before purchase).\n* And Muslim men were molesting slave women, without any fear of physical punishment, while Muhammad/Allah didn't punish or even rebuked them for molesting slave women. Thus, Muslim men were even kidnapping slave women of others, and raping them, without any fear of punishment. Muslim men were raping slave girls in Temporary Sexual Relationships, and selling them, in order to buy new slave girls to rape them too. They were swapping their slave girls and raping them ... In short, Islamic Sharia turned Muslim men into serial rapists legally by giving them full control over the poor slave girls.\n\nYes, all these facts are correct and it is indeed the 1300 years long history of \"Islamic Slavery\", where thousands of slave women were present with naked breasts in Public. Unfortunately, 99% of Muslims don't know about it today.\n\n[Please read all proofs here](https://atheism-vs-islam.com/).\n\n&#x200B;",

Then all of a sudden on the third day I’m having trouble breathing, I’m hacking up a lung, and feeling super dizzy. My partner rushes me to the hospital and I’m c-rayed and told that while my lungs are congested the Doctor believes I’m on the tail end of things. Next day my temp is high (41.1) I have trouble breathing and dizzy. Rushed to hospital again. Same doctor x-rays me, says “well you look a little more congested but I still think you’re on the tail end of this”, sends me home. 6 hours later it’s 7 a.m and I’ve been watching Netflix on my phone while dangled over the edge of the bed so I can cough shit into the bucket there. I feel so dizzy i can’t see straight and then nothing. When I open my eyes again it’s 10 a.m and I feel like I can’t move my body, and can’t seem to call out. I call 911 and I’m trying to tell them what’s wrong but the only two words I can get out are “peanut and tuna” and they are very slow and slurred. It takes an hour on the phone before I can talk enough to tell this woman where I am and my words are still slurred and I still feel like I can’t move. When the paramedics arrive they get no physical response to poking things under my fingernails, so I’m carried out. I remember the E.M.T saying my oxygen rate is 64% before I black out again. When I come to in the hospital I still can’t move. It took me two days before I could walk again and due to hypoxia (oxygen loss) everything is hard to do including walking to the bathroom. It took 2 months to get all better (to the point where I was able to do things on my own again. I thought about that recently. During that time I was blacked out I was just barely above brain dead.

  "selftext": "The African Methodist Episcopal Zion (AMEZ) Church is a historically significant denomination within the broader African Methodist Episcopal tradition. While it is important to approach any analysis of religious institutions with fairness and respect, it is also crucial to recognize that no organization is immune to criticism or negative perceptions. In the case of the AMEZ Church, some individuals may hold certain views that cast the denomination in a negative light. It is important to note that these perspectives may not reflect the entirety of the church or its members, as opinions can vary widely.\r  \n\r  \nOne potential criticism of the AMEZ Church, as with any organized religion, is the possibility of financial mismanagement or corruption within its administrative structures. Large religious organizations often rely on the financial contributions of their members, and concerns may arise about how these resources are allocated and utilized. Instances of financial impropriety, such as embezzlement or misuse of funds, have been known to occur in various religious institutions, and the AMEZ Church may not be exempt from such concerns.\r  \n\r  \nAnother area of potential criticism lies in the theological or doctrinal stances of the AMEZ Church. Different individuals and communities may have differing interpretations of religious texts and beliefs, leading to disagreements or concerns. For example, some individuals may question certain aspects of the church's teachings on social issues, gender equality, or LGBTQ+ rights. These discrepancies can create tension between the denomination and those who hold opposing views, resulting in negative perceptions from those who feel marginalized or excluded.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, like any religious institution, the AMEZ Church may face criticism regarding its internal governance, leadership, and decision-making processes. Some individuals may perceive the church as hierarchical or autocratic, with power concentrated in the hands of a select few. This perception could lead to concerns about accountability, transparency, and inclusivity within the denomination.\r  \n\r  \nFurthermore, historical controversies or incidents involving individual members or leaders of the AMEZ Church may contribute to negative perceptions. While the actions of a few individuals should not be seen as representative of an entire denomination, instances of misconduct, scandals, or controversies can tarnish the reputation of an organization and cause public skepticism.\r  \n\r  \nIt is essential to remember that these negative perceptions or criticisms are not universally held and do not define the entire AMEZ Church or its members. Many individuals find great solace, support, and community within the denomination, and it has played a significant role in African American history and culture. Understanding and acknowledging both the positive contributions and areas of concern within any religious institution can lead to a more comprehensive and balanced assessment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - Black churches hurt our society.

Again, if you read my last post, you'll know that having to go to church always fills me with high anxiety for the entire day.

  "selftext": "Hello! I was just curious, in the atheist community, how widespread is awareness of Atheopaganism and similar concepts. I’m unsure whether they’re something many atheist people have often encountered online, or if they’re fairly unknown. I’m an atheist myself, have been since 11 when I realized what I was taught in Catholic school made no sense in the real world. Now I’m at the beginning of a masters of science in developmental biology, and a strong advocate for the power and importance of science and rationality. \n\nHowever, quietly and unaware to my social circle, I’m also an atheopagan and a practitioner of naturalistic witchcraft. That means I have no supernatural belief at all, don’t believe in any kind of magic or divination. And yet, I read tarot cards all the time as a tool for reflection and introspection.  I ‘pray’ over candles and burning herbs, even though I’m fully aware I’m not praying to anyone. I even make charms and tokens for success and good luck to carry around, and other such things normally associated with supernatural belief. And they work! -but only in as much as they affect my own mindset and remind me to keep on track when I touch them. \n\nThere are a lot of us! And a way higher ratio of scientists and other academics than in the general population, which I find interesting. We tend to hold reverence for the sun and moon and for natural life processes such as evolution, ecosystem interconnection and the cycle of life, death, decomposition and the return of chemical materials into new life. \n\nFor me, I love doing these things. I envied, as an atheist, the connection and meaning provided by spirituality, ritual, and ceremony for those who had it. For example, I always felt very moved during indigenous smudging ceremonies I took part in. It seemed enviable to have a spirituality that connected you to land, culture, etc., which I saw no way to have as an atheist, since in Western society those things are mostly captured by religion. It was a really nice thing for me to learn that I could have those things without compromising my values of rationality and evidence. I think it’s good for atheists to know that they can do these irrational things if they want to, for their own meaning and personal benefit, and not somehow lose their atheist badge.\n\nOf course I’m not here to ‘proselytize’. The great thing about being an Atheopagan is that I have zero stake in whether anyone else is one. We’re just different flavours of atheist in a big delicious skeptical soup. But I admit, I would like for people to know that these things exist! So I’d like to know what your experience with these ideas is.",

  "selftext": "FINAL FINAL EDIT: I tried finding some common ground and did receive some very supportive comments. I did not promote my religion, convince anyone to accept it, and stood against dogmatism. I only wanted to express my absolute fear of religious dogmatism and how to combat it. You don't understand how lost and vulnerable I am right now in life and I don't know who to turn to.\n\n I'm sorry for suggesting religious and atheists folk could work together, many commenters made it clear that this idea is preposterous. Clearly I posted in the wrong place and I respect that this space is not for me. I certainly don't want to bring up religious trauma in those who have read my post here. Thank you to those who were supportive. That support means a LOT, and gives me hope. \n\nGiven the hostility, I'm going to be deleting my account because I'm no longer comfortable with people knowing any personal details about me or my partner, which apartently people found out and deduced certain other details as well from my history. I also need to avoid all this for a while to focus on my mental health and sort  out my own fears.\n\nI will continue fighting against religious dogmatism to protect my partner and to let people live freely. \n\n\n-------\n\nEDIT (FINAL): OK it looks like I clearly posted in the wrong sub. I did not do so out of malice, just didn't know. To those who were supportive, and explained where I went wrong, thank you. To those who are more interested in posting hate comments (one that was truly shocking and removed by the mods), sorry for being in your space. Let me clarify some points raised. Y'all also need to understand that religious beliefs can be quite nuanced and people can have them for many reasons including as a means of getting out of severe depression. I thought we could find common ground against dogmatism - because that is the biggest threat to people's freedom. I am not trying to preach to anyone, I want to find allies against the common enemy. Again, I guess I posted on the wrong sub, I didn't know. \n\nOne commenter apparently saw my history and found out I have a trans gf. Yes I am FKING scared about her safety in the midst of rising fundamentalism and if I had to choose, I would choose her over anything, any day. I feel like I'm gonna drown in a sea of anxiety over this shit. The point of my post was NOT to discuss the validity of religion but to find out how we can end the craziness that's religious fundamentalism. The answer is not as simple as making people leave religion because they're just NOT gonna do that, at least in the near future. Meanwhile there are evil people doing everything they can to take away people's right. I'm sorry but we can't do this alone, we just can't. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am very religious and I LOVE this sub. Let me explain.\n\nI don't want to force my religious beliefs on others and I don't want others to force their beliefs on me. \n\nUnfortunately I feel like a lot of religious people I know don't agree with that simple concept. Now maybe I just got unlucky that I know such people, but tbh I feel like religious fascism is once again on the rise around the world and I'm genuinely concerned. \n\nWhen we have so many different religions, we cannot create laws based on any one belief system because how can we say which one is correct?? Just because we believe that ours is \"correct,\" we can't impose that on others because where is the evidence for this? I follow my religious beliefs because I find them helpful for me. All I can ever do is tell others about that, but what I cannot do is vote for laws that would trample their freedom to NOT follow my belief system. \n\nSo when you have all these varying beliefs systems, what is the most logical course of action? I think it's to use empathy and common sense. If something doesn't hurt anyone, it should be allowed even if it goes against someone's religious belief. Cry about it. Ironically, this is also the best way to preserve religious freedom around the world because no one imposes their beliefs on others. \n\nI love the idea of atheism because at least we can START thinking about these ideas, whereas with religious bigots I can't even explain this simple concept because they can't get their head out of whatever doctrine that was written centuries ago.  And there are hundreds of these, and they can never be questioned, and they all claim to be the true and final word of God. Oh, and you MUST follow it or they'll come after you. I'm so sick of it.\n\nThat being said, there are religious people I've met who do agree with me. I really wish there was a way for atheists and other religious people around the world, who agree with what I've said, to unite against the bigots. What do you guys think...\n\n\n\nPS \nIf science says something else (simple thing like evolution), and there is proof of it, I would rather believe science instead of a religious text. And I should be free to do that even if I'm religious.\n\n\nEDIT: Ok I seem to have annoyed a lot of people so mods, if you think the post should be deleted, it's fine. I feel like I relate to atheism in the way that I don't want a society that creates and enforces laws based on religion because it's nothing more than a belief system. \n\nAnd yes, you don't \"BELIEVE\" in science - apologies for the wrong choice of words. It's based on empirical evidence, so if it's true, it's true. That is what I meant, I should have thought about how it sounded before posting.  \n\nI have faced a lot of turmoil because of this whole thing and I feel really lost, I thought I could find common ground, and I'm sorry",

Here’s the full paragraph (emphasis mine):  \n“And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, a girl sitting on her own in a small café in Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything.”  \nI guess what Adams was trying to say, and the reason why I find this quote so close to my heart, is that it is possible to appreciate the goodness that is attributed to Jesus without buying into the religion bit.  \nIf only some Christians (especially so-called Christians who advocate war, violence, xenophobia, nationalism, racism, distrust or hate) took some time out to contemplate what Jesus actually said, we might be living in a better world today.\"\n\nI completely agree with this.

  "selftext": "Last night, while struggling to fall asleep, I found myself pondering the idea of a world without a god. As a M20 theist, I believe that nothingness might not truly exist. When you close your eyes, you might see darkness, black, some colors, or even TV static. But what if none of those things existed? It's difficult for me to fathom, and I wonder if it's even possible.\r  \n\r  \nInterestingly, I thought about individuals who have been blind since birth. They wouldn't know what \"black\" looks like, or even the concept of colors. Does this mean \"nothing\" exists in their world because we have defined \"colors\" as a \"thing\"?\r  \n\r  \nThis led me to question whether nothingness actually exists when there is a complete absence of anything. When we consider what happens before birth and after death, could it all be just nothingness? And if so, does this concept of nothingness only come into existence because of our presence? If we, as well as the entire universe, did not exist, would nothingness still be a valid concept?",

  "selftext": "I considered myself an atheist for a few years after losing my faith, and I took part in the atheist community itself during a lot of that time. At some point, though, I started to feel like I didn’t relate to the majority of atheists in my circles. It really wasn’t the lack of belief in God that turned me away, but rather the lack of imagination.\n\nI’m not saying all atheists lack imagination, so if you do have imagination then I hope it’s obvious that this isn’t about you, and I apologize if this sounds insulting to you or any of your atheist friends. To be clear, I’m saying that I started to find a LOT of people on the atheist community that were just as particular about logic as religious people can be about their religion. To be fair, I get it, and I think it makes sense for people to leave religion with sort of a rubber band effect, escaping it with an amount of force relative to the degree to which it was slammed down our throats, so I don’t think it’s unreasonable to be so hyper-focused on logic if you feel like the irrational was shoved onto you for so long. However, I do feel like true recovery is really being able to eventually let go of extremes in all forms. Sometimes I feel like atheism is like the guy watching the fast and the furious commenting on the fact that it isn’t realistic. Yes, dude, it’s unrealistic but it isn’t really supposed to be, so if you don’t like it that’s fine but if you think it’s trying to be realistic then you’re missing the point.\n\nAfter years of identifying as an atheist, and eventually finding myself questioning my lack of belief due to the particularities of atheists putting me off just as much as those of the religious, I’ve found animism and this feels like truth to me. Maybe I never felt like I fit in the atheist community because I never truly was one, and that’s ok. I’m fine with accepting that now just as much as I’m ok with accepting that I may never have been a Christian.\n\nI’m curious if anyone else feels this way.

I would appreciate if the members of this community could help me understand some specific cases that I don't really know how to explain. I present these cases below:\n\n\\- I have read in several forums that there are people who affirm that they listened to a relative or acquaintance speak another language while sleeping and by recording it they actually managed to translate phrases that this person spoke in languages that they supposedly did not know.\n\n\\- I recently had to live through an experience like this personally and my boyfriend woke me up at dawn talking in my sleep but it seemed that he was babbling nonsense things. I didn't start recording anything because it seemed like he was having a nightmare and I just rushed to wake him up. Just before waking up he said a phrase that I did understand in our language and said \"someone protect me\". He told me that he had a nightmare but he didn't remember saying anything. This freaked me out a bit and I haven't been able to find much information on why this happens.\n\n\\- Lastly, I want to cite a comment that I have read in a reddit forum and I have not found an explanation for it. His comment is as follows: \"He was very much involved in charismatic circles when he was 20 years old and he was completely and totally dedicated to God. I can't explain this. So, I can't completely say that I'm totally ex-Christian, but I'm not a Christian anymore either. I guess I always have room for it. I prayed for the gift of tongues after being saved. At 15, I started speaking in them. I couldn't even pretend to pray like that before, I would have been speechless. Later that night in my room I asked God and then I opened my mouth and a different language was coming out. In college, I was praying only in tongues and I noticed this very phrase at the beginning of many sentences. I didn't know how to write it because it had a sound that we don't have in English, but I wrote it as “Isa Khouda”. I did a Google search and the words \"Isa Khoda\" mean \"Jesus is Lord\" in Farsi, the language of Iran. I don't speak a single word of this language.\"\n\nI await his comment and thanks to whoever is willing to investigate.",

While the Old Testament does command things that we would consider immoral by modern standards, it was probably progressive for that time, or at least similar in values to other communities of that time (eg. OT law similar to Code of Hammurabi). The war and conquest of old testament was directed mostly towards other hostile nations that probably would have done the same.

  "selftext": "I have always understood atheism to mean \"without theism\", ie disbelief in a certain kind of god. Theoretically one could be a deist and still be an atheist.\n\nListening to an old debate (Craig vs Hitchens) he defined atheism as belief in no god (countering Hichens' argument that even if you prove the universe had a divine creator, you haven't proven theism). [Webster.com](https://Webster.com) defines theism as \"belief in a god or gods\" then has a secondary definition saying \"Specifically...\" and citing the theist god.\n\nI'm big on definitions (you can thank my time working with a crew of Scientologists for that). So what's correct? Is atheism really just a-theism as I think, or is it properly defined as a disbelief in all gods?",

  "selftext": "Ancient India had many philosophies, some of them rejected to believe in God.\nThey were termed as Nastika Darshanas (Nihilistic philosophies) by Vedic Brahmins.\n   \n   1. Jains: Rejects Gods. Believes in Heaven and Hell but rejects to go to heaven due to paradox of Hedonism. Practices asceticism. Believes in Karma and reincarnation.\n   \n  2. Buddhism- Rejects God, rejects soul. Believes in Karma and reincarnation. It is the mind that is reincarnated and not the soul. Practices the middle path between asceticism and hedonism. Believes that Life is Suffering, birth is suffering etc. Goal is to end suffering and attain Nirvana.\n \n    3. Charvakas:- Rejects Gods, rejects soul, rejects karma and reincarnation. Approves Hedonism even if you need to take a loan to drink Ghee (an Indian luxurious milk product). Complete atheists.\n    \n  4. Ajjivikas- Don't know much but they reject, God. Not sure about soul but believes in Fate. They said, everything is pre-destined and no point in  praying to a God. Still practices asceticism and meditation. I think they were also lazy and didn't believe in karma (action).\n\n   Out of all these Buddhism dominated at one time but later they (Mahayana Buddhism) started accepting Hindu Gods and Goddesses in their system and turned theistic. Theravada still doesn't give attention to Gods.\n \n  Beside these Nastika schools. An Astika  Vedic school believed in Devas but rejected to believe in Creator Force since suffering exists in this world so Creator must be an evil force. They were Samkhya philosophers.\n\nWhat's your opinion on these atheistic schools? Which one is better?\nMy opinion, Charvakas are completely atheists like modern atheists except they didn't had science to debunk religious claims.\nBuddhists gave a good solution to sufferings of world and now we have secular Buddhism which is free from dogmas and traditional beliefs.",

  "selftext": "I get that Lil Nas X or Doja Cat et all think that tweaking the Christo-fascists is just trolling them to draw into the open how prejudiced and intolerant and stupid the average American right winger is these days. I also like that they fight the legal battles that the First Amendment actually does affirm (based on unalienable rights). Aesthetically it may be kind of cool in a Iron Maiden cover art kind of way, sure. But, tactically it's poor.  When you consider that satanism is using Christian iconography, that's strike one. When you consider that satan is universally known as the embodiment of evil in terms of several milennia of cultural shorthand, then surely now you're playing with fire. The point is that (universally in the Western world) Satan embodies evil. What is evil? It's shorthand for callous disregard for others, delight in causing suffering, anti-social mayhem, the triumph of the beastial animal human fear based selfishness in our nature, etc.  Are you going to take that side of the argument? It's stupid, really. Sam Harris would probably not hold it's the best approach based on evolutionary forces which produced social cohesion as a basis for day to day moral action.\n\nConsider: if someone offered you Satan Candy, would you eat it? Sure, there's no such thing as Satan. If you want to blame Milton or Dante, fine, though the Bible does at least say Jesus was sent someone to tempt him in the desert. But the point is, it might taste sweet but what are the chances it's poisoned or has razors in it. If Satan did exist and offered you food, he'd laugh if you cut your tounge because that's the kind of hurtful wacky prank someone who was sociopathic or psychopathic would enjoy. So, you know, why offer it to others with a smirk and blame them when they recoil?\n\nTo that degree, by posing as the worst fears of a Christian and adopting the guise of someone known to be irredeemably anti-social, you're just confirming their beliefs to them, not challenging them in any meaningful way. You're just pushing them to dig deeper into their hole. It may be amusing to watch and you get to feel morally superior, but you're not really since all you do is increase the rancor. Who here has played with fire? Do tell how that didn't burn you too.  Hell, I even just cut my hand open doing the 4th of July sparkle cones on the street shit for my kids after a few beers (it didn't light, go check it, it explodes), and I bet most of us have a story in that regard (to stretch the metaphor to its limits). \n\nTelling them you believe in the Spaghetti Monster allows you to reducto absurd on them. It's a three pointer rather than a dunk, which is worth one more point that a apparently threatening culture war offensive.\n\nSo, I say: let the Stones dabble with the idea to explore concepts that revolve around the embodiment of evil, fine. They're smirky but not directly confrontational. But *they* didn't dress up as Satan or claim explicitly to subscribe to Satanism, even in jest. Did LaVey act like a gentleman to women and I missed it? But the noodle appendages of the FSM bring sauce and cheese to the world, and if you can get a Christian or other religious person to start trying to parse your absurd analogy, they might get so off topic that they can't wheel out their standard irrational defense mechanisms and fallback positions as well. And, if you really want to reduce the Christo-fascist grip on American culture, and you don't want to exacerbate the rancor (which would really be healthy for our culture), then consider the FSM your first choice.\n\nThat's my take and I'm sticking to it.  Now I'm hungery for pasta, but I'll be back for the two people who might respond to this before the internet buries my brilliant take in a sea of sensationalism and misguided perpetual rancor due to the algos reiterating the worst in human nature instead of elevating me to the position of persuasive champion for rational thought.",

I honestly think humanity has a misplaced sense of self importance. \n\nThey asked my opinion and I basically stated I don't believe there is any moral reason against the death penalty. The only reason to be anti death penalty is democratic. If enough people vote to ban it then so be it.\n\nMy children were kind of shocked. I cannot say I am pro death penalty nor am I anti it.

Depends on who you ask. \n\nTL:DR- Im sure god understands the difference between a drawing of you idolizing something vs a drawing of an animal/person in every context.\n\nI went on a rant about the topic and wanted to share it cause why not.\nTo those who are islamic, i mean no disrespect in this, but does your god not realize your not worshipping a drawing or the depiction in the drawing?\n\nIf your worried about one upping god’s creations, do you really think god doesn’t understand that your drawing/realistic drawing isnt trying to create a better version of the animal? If anyone would have to choose to see an otter in person vs a drawing of it, i think everyone would agree that the real deal is infinite times better than a drawing.\nIts like your a well renowned artist and see your kid try to replicate your drawing of a wolf with a stick figure, do you really think god would get pissed and think his own kid is trying to one up him?\n\nFor the argument of Idolatry, for those who dont know Idolatry, its to worship/praise/idolize something as a god other than the true god.\n \nNow i can understand if your literally making a drawing of a different god in worship or animal if your worshipping animals, that makes sense. \nFor drawing an animal for practice or an adt project, do you really think god cant tell that you’re not idolizing a drawing of a fuckin wolf?\nLike seriously, your intent isnt to praise it or see it as a god, can your god not see that? \n\nIf your talking about Religious art specifically, same thing. Can god not tell that the animals on noahs ark isnt you just adding details to the ark? I think god can understand that the religious depictions of places in the Quran isnt you worshipping the denizens of that religious place from the book god comes from.\n\nSrry for the pointless rant, im just baffled by this. Again, i mean no disrespect to the religious out there, i just dont see the logic of drawings being considered idolizing.

  "selftext": "Both of these guys are incredibly smart and generally logical thinkers. I have known one of my friends for over 12 years. He is 32 and has never been a theist in his entire life. He would constantly describe religion as \"the biggest lie in history\". He has always been lazy, spending most of his life getting drunk and high and doing basically nothing but playing video games all the time. At some point, he disappeared and didn't talk to me or my other friend for about 8 months, during which time he became religious. He alleges that visiting Bible study groups completely resolved these issues for him. He argues that following the Bible is good, regardless of whether it is true or not. He further claims that it's possible that all of science is actually a massive conspiracy and none of it is actually true and all of the results proving, for example, evolution is all false. I will call this guy Christian.\n\nThe other friend I've known for about 4 years, and I've been working with him as a business partner (we are both professional gamblers) since about right when my other friend vanished. He's just 20 years old, and was actually a devout Christian when I first met him, but changed his mind and became a full-on atheist after I and some of his college classes convinced him it was all false. I'll call this guy Logan.\n\nExactly one day after Christian returned from essentially ghosting us for 8 months and told Logan he was religious, Logan vanished. We thought he was dead, actually. We tried contacting the police and after three days learned he was in jail. Apparently, the police pulled him over, and for some ungodly reason, he agreed to allow them to search his car while he was carrying $105,000 cash. The police arrested him for possession of drug proceeds, stole all of his possessions (including his driver's license), and I had to have Christian, who lived closer to the jail, drive up, bail him out, and babysit him for a couple weeks while we tried to get a judge to agree to give his license back (which he couldn't get a copy of because he was very far from his state of residence). We later learned that the police also planted a small amount of cocaine in his bag to try to more easily be able to steal his money (if you want to learn more about police racketeering, google \"civil asset forfeiture\").\n\nClearly, my friend was shaken up by this whole process. He explained that he pretty much immediately became religious after this. Why this would turn someone religious I don't quite understand, but that's the effect it had on him. He all of a sudden started to believe in an \"objective morality\" based upon the Bible's insanity, as well as that the universe must have been created by Yahweh because of \"a hunch\" he has. I've tried explaining to Logan why his religious beliefs are unreasonable, using the following line of reasoning:\n\nHe verified that he believes all of the following are true: The Bible is accurate. The Bible contains historical accounts of various things. The Adam and Eve story contained within Genesis is an accurate historical account. The Adam and Eve story contained within Genesis states that Adam and Eve were created 6 days after the origin of the universe as the only two existing humans with no ancestors. The theory of evolution is accurate science. The theory of evolution states that life began billions of years ago, and after billion of years of evolution, humans as we know them began to appear, as a large population of animals, just like all species, without any specific two individuals that could be said to be the \"first humans\". Adam and Eve were not created 6 days after the creation of the universe because God's definition of the word \"day\" differs from our modern usage of the word \"day\". Adam and Eve evolved as normal animals who became human by being infused with a soul by God, which contradicts the Biblical account.\n\nAfter affirming all of these things to be what he believes, I explained that many of his beliefs contradict one another. He affirmed that he does not hold any contradictory beliefs. He then said exactly this to me in a text message: \"i believe that perceived  discrepancy or incompatibility between what is contained in the Bible and the findings of modern science are either a misinterpretation of the Bible, a mistake in scientific findings or both\"\n\nSo he has essentially defined his beliefs as being correct, as per his own definition, any evidence that contradicts God existing is in some way flawed despite that he is completely unable to actually point out the flaws in that evidence.\n\nClearly, logical argumentation is not effective. How do I convince someone who is willing to believe completely contradictory things and pre-define his own beliefs as correct in spite of any evidence to the contrary? A person who, just a single month ago, was staunchly atheist, and used to make fun of theists for being so stupid?",

This is meant to just be an introduction to my thoughts on the topic, and I tried to very carefully express myself to make it a polite contribution to a very heated debate. Some of the points that I make about atheism: 1) The atheist community should devote more resources not only towards healing for those who leave religions, but also towards providing community, cultural, and connection resources in general. Most studies show that religious participation contributes to health, and atheist communities should align resources towards creating culture, community, and opportunities for social connection. 2) Some atheist thinkers sort of set up a straw man fallacy by attacking specific religious traditions, rather than addressing spiritual notions more broadly. There are some other considerations. Please be polite, since we're a new channel. Thanks!",

  "selftext": "So, to preface I'll just say I've been an atheist for over 20 years, and when I was younger I grew up in a reform Jewish household and would say I was only nominally religious then.  I never really truly felt the presence of God back then.\n\nBut recently, I feel like maybe, I possibly did.\n\nA couple weeks back, I went to see the Tudeschi Trucks band at MSG.  Derek Trucks is a phenomenal guitar player, and I just love great guitar playing.  He did things that got me completely amped up, full of excitement, full of joy, full of just pure bliss.\n\nAnd I realized this feeling I was having... why, this seems like it's just got to be the same thing I've seen deeply religious people experience.  Like, they're in the church, the music is going, it's a big celebratory atmosphere, and the people are really just feeling their faith, feeling their belief, and that hope of eternal bliss in the kingdom of heaven.  And I'm standing there, in the Garden, listening to Derek Trucks just wailing, and I'm feeling that.  That feeling.\n\nNow, I'm a little bit drunk, I'm a little bit stoned... and my thoughts and feelings are wandering, and I start to get this sense like God himself is trying to reach out to me through this music.  Trying to show me that this bliss is THE bliss, the reward of Heaven ever after.  \n\nI'm kind of zoning in and out of the music, I mean, the band is really great, the songs are really good, but the reason I'm there is to hear Derek do that thing on guitar, and in between that, I'm not as completely locked into the music.  So, I'm standing there, with that thought swirling around in my head, and I suddenly notice, Susan Tudeschi is singing this song, and refrain keeps going:  \"Have a little faith in me, have a little faith in me\"\n\nand at that point, I immediately square off, face-to-face with that little voice, that little feeling I was having about God and I'm now thinking directly to that feeling:  \"Oh, come the fuck on!  Isn't that a little *too* on the nose!\"\n\nI wasn't even sure what to think about it.  Coincidence?  Serendipity?  I dunno.  That feeling really did have some weight, some gravity deep into the core of my consciousness.  I couldn't just completely put it aside and forget about it.  So I guess that's why I'm sharing about it now.\n\nDo I really believe in God now?  I don't know...  Not really.  But I feel like the door opened up just a crack.  The one thing I can say is whoever this was trying to show me something, I didn't sense that this was connected to any particular religion which I suppose would be pointing me towards Deism if anything.\n\nOr maybe Madison Square Garden is my church, and Derek Trucks' guitar playing is my religion\n\n&#x200B;",

When I got up there I started immediately crying and this huge wave of something washed over my body, I fell over, my entire body went numb I was having trouble catching my breath. I really don't know what it was besides something supernatural, but I really don't want to believe anymore.It’s things like this that keep me believing.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea of a natural explanation for any of this?",

  "selftext": "Longtime atheist with an interest in theological history. I've been reading about how early Christians (and apocalyptic Jews) believed that instead of going to heaven or hell when you died, you'd just stay in the ground until the Last Judgment when God (presumably) would judge you as righteous or not and punish/reward accordingly. And I can see how that made a certain kind of sense to first century believers. But by now there have been \\*how many\\* billions of people who've lived and died? How does one (albeit perfect, all-knowing) entity examine every action taken over the course of a lifetime by every one of those trillions(?)/quadrillions(?) to make a reasoned judgment about whether they deserve eternal life or punishment? \n\nI mean, one way might be to make the criteria extremely narrow: (1) they accepted Jesus, they get rewarded, they didn't they suffer eternally. But surely He (if it's a \"he\") must realize that people's essential goodness or evil is more nuanced than that, right? If He's wise and just and all that. Presumably you'd want to know how they treated others but I suspect for most of us that's a mixed bag (mostly good people sometimes do bad things; mostly selfish/unkind people may have some mitigating factors). Does He do all the weighing or does he depend on underlings to do the research? What if they make a mistake?\n\nAlso, how could one (superior) being know all the nuances of how billions upon billions of individuals living across countless historical eras conducted each and every day of their lives?

I understand that the Bible was written soo many thousands of years ago and that anyone can write something down, and eventually, it'll happen at some point in some way.

  "selftext": "I’ve always harbored a lingering question about religion. Born in a secular country but raised in a relatively religious family, I’ve been exposed to various religious beliefs and practices. My grandparents are religious, and to some extent, so are my parents. As I grew up, I found myself entangled in thoughts and discussions about religion, always stumbling upon questions and contradictions that seemed insurmountable.\r  \n\r  \nMost major religions share common elements:\r  \n1. The existence of a mighty, if not all-powerful, god.\r  \n2. A propensity to convert others, often boundlessly.\r  \n\r  \nLet’s delve into the second point: religions invariably encourage conversion, urging people to believe in the existence of a deity or deities. This seems to stem from the assumption that God desires belief from humans, as evidenced by the existence of preachers.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if God desires belief, there seem to be simpler ways to cultivate it:\r  \n1. An omnipotent God could instill belief in everyone (if humans’ thoughts aren’t controlled by god, then we cannot say such god is omnipotent).\r  \n2. A powerful, though not omnipotent, God could use manifest signs, like writing in the clouds, to persuade humanity of His existence.\r  \n3. A God, more powerful than humans but not overwhelmingly so, could reveal Himself and perform undeniable miracles, compelling belief. (this can be as simple as moving objects by mind. However, if such god does exist, why do humans have to worship an entity who can only do simple tasks.)\r  \n\r  \nIf none of these are the case, does it imply that God doesn’t desire universal belief? Some argue that God’s reluctance to prove His existence unequivocally is a test of faith, a divine selection process. However, this perspective raises further questions:\r  \n1. Do preachers, by propagating faith, undermine God’s test by guiding people on how to \"pass\"?\r  \n2. If this is a test, what characteristics is God selecting for? It seems like gullibility might be a trait being selected in this scenario. If so, why would God value gullibility?",

Religion has always rubbed me the wrong, but after coming to terms with my bisexuality and after my brother's coming out, I've come to hate it, especially Christianity. In recent years with Christian politicians trying to ban abortion and BC it's only gotten worse.\n\nFast forward to now, last year I got my heart broken in a pretty brutal way and it took me months to get back on my feet and move on. In the process of moving on I met a wonderful guy via a mutual friend, we have a lot in common and instantly hit it off. I've been thinking about pursuing him and even started begging my friend to set us up. Today I found out that he's Christian and I don't know what to do. I don't think I can ever see myself dating someone religious, it's always been a deal breaker for me. \n\nMy reasoning is that it seems impossible to overcome such a huge difference in how we perceive the world. This combined with the bigotry accompanying a majority of Christians is putting a huge damper on my initial feelings for him. Like I don't know if he's bi/homophobic but past experiences don't lie. \n\nNow for my dilemma, usually a situation like this might seem cut and dry but a close friend who's also an atheist is telling me that this doesn't have to matter. She says that if everything else fits than something like this shouldn't stop me but I'm still unsure. I genuinely like him a lot but I don't think I can get over this.\n\nSo, my question is: Have any of you experience with dating a Christian and how did it turn out? Is it worth or will this eventually break us apart? \n\nI'm not a native speaker by the way, so I apologize if any of this is confusing or incomprehensible!\n\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your help and advice! I know now what I need to do, I know it might hurt and it isn't what I expected when I went into this but better now than later. Once again, thank you to each and every one of you, I really appreciate that you took a second out of your day to help a lost girl.",

  "selftext": "My lovely, wonderful, amazing girlfriend has basically fundamentalist Christians for family and her mom is the most fervent in \"The Bible is The Truth\". I am respectful of their beliefs, but they definitely want me to convert. My partner believes in a higher power, but her skin crawls with the idea of reading the Bible and praying every day.  \n\nI will admit that I am not completely sold on the idea that there is absolutely nothing, but based on the evidence provided, I am 99.9% sure that there's nothing after the lights turn off and we just need to live the most kind, most caring, and best life we see fit. To me, if there is such a divine thing, it isn't some old dude with a beard.  \n\nA little duplicitous, but I told her mom that I am open to \"trying\" to understand God, but that she shouldn't expect a change. This was designed to extend an olive branch because her daughter and I are talking marriage and that we both would prefer to get a blessing (not permission) from her folks. So for the holidays, I was gifted a Bible that has annotation that provides context to the passages (which to me, doesn't sound like \"Truth\" if it needs to be put into context, but whatever).  \n\nI'm going to read that doorstop front to back. That's not here nor there. I guess my question for my fellow \"heathens\" is \"is there an order I should read this all, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that makes sense?\"  \nThanks all!\n\nEdit: I think I need to be more clear about something.\n\nMy girlfriend is super happy with me and while she is uncomfortable with going to the mat with her family about religion, it's not about me, it's about her family's faith and her own. She acknowledges that while it would be easier for her family if I was Christian, she would still have a very hard time with her folks and her own faith. She is prepared to defend me and our relationship viciously and when I've mentioned this annotated Bible and needing to read it, she has said \"you don't have to do that for me.\" She also had said that I am not perfect, but I'm perfect for her and my lack of faith isn't an issue for her. \n\nThe other aspect is that I am starting as I intend to continue with her folks. I have said point blank \"I am subject to change. There are things in this world that science can't explain yet and one of the most brilliant minds of humankind said you get closer to God the further you go into science. With that being said, preaching is not going to change me; I am going to change me.\" Her mom has only asked that I try, so to keep the waters calm, I am happy to try, knowing that I might gain some academic knowledge only.\n\nLastly, her folks, in spite of my atheistism, are rooting for us. The last time I spoke to her mom, she said to my gf, \"he is such a good man, I love him and see why you do, too. Do not fuck this up.\" I think they hope that I will find their salvation, but in the end, even with an \"I love you, but...\", they are supportive. ",

  "title": "Atheist theory that has been bugging me for a while",
  "selftext": "I am an atheist, but I don't really like taking a moral stance on Christianity or any other religion, because I think that anyone can be an absolute asshole regardless of religion. The reason I'm an atheist is because I just think the idea of there existing anything spiritual or supernatural is just absurd, and I have a theory why. \n\nThe reason that this theory bugs me is that I haven't been able to poke any holes in it, and it just makes complete sense to me, which seems paradoxical but I personally don't think I'm the kind of person to be able to come up with a perfect theory for everything? So atheist or not, I'd love for someone to try to dispute me on this, which is why I'm posting here in the first place. I might also just be parroting the lines of people that have spoken before, it's just that I'm not well read enough to know that. \n\nI've also split this into two parts to make it easier to read so it's not just mindless rambling, even if it is.\n\n1.\n\nThe idea of a conscious \"creator\" means that of course, there has to be the creation process. But why create in the first place? Isn't the idea of creation, of a piece of art or a tool or invention, inherently human, because creating new things is simply just another way of surviving? Why would we assume something so inherently human to be fundamental to the universe around us? And why does God have emotions; anger, happiness, sadness, that are also inherent to human survival, if God doesn't need to do anything to survive? \n\nIf the Christian God is ultimate perfection, then it should not be human in the slightest or even conscious, because the reason that we are living the way we are is that every single feature on a human being is there to reflect our evolutionary adaptations through time. We are intelligent so that we can think our way out escaping predators or catching or own prey. We see, think and feel so that we can scan the world around us for potential threats or food. For what reason does God \"think\"?\n\nWhy is it then, that spirits and Gods, who not only created the beings but also created everything else in the universe completely separately from humans that function even without human knowledge, are so life-like, and so much like us, if they don't need to survive? \n\n2. \n\nA lot of Christians and theists would probably say that there's no proof for those things being our survival function. However, even things that may seem useless in the animal world, like a sense of morality or feelings of grief, provide humans with a deep social bond and sense of cohesion that enables survival, but when they fail they can be a heavy evolutionary disadvantage -- but why is that? The Christian might say, why are we still not perfect, if we formed over millions and billions of years?\n\nChristians might say that it's because we're not meant to be perfect, and that we will be perfect when we go to heaven etc., but they fail to realise that they are putting a false standard of perfection in place. Humanity exists because we have adapted to solving problems. Every single feature on humans exists to overcome a barrier to survival -- for example, complex communication exists because we cannot read each other's minds, and communication exists so we have social cohesion and that exists because we're strong as many.  If our earliest ancestors were placed in an environment without any of these barriers to survival, they surely would not have become as we are today, particularly not as intelligent, or fast, or strong. \n\nWith perfection and no need for survival, with all necessary needs met -- the creature becomes nothing more than something non-living. Why then, is God so human?\n\nThe answer to me, of course, is that the people that came up with this idea didn't know that their features came from evolution. The knowledge of our past isn't hardwired into our brains, though the evidence for it is everywhere in our bodies. They saw the result and tried to reverse engineer it to trace it back to the only thing they were familiar with -- some form of Creator or God that was us, but greater, in some way. Any thoughts?",

  "selftext": "I'm actually not an atheist (I reject all religion but I do still feel like some kind of \"god\" exists -- maybe I'm agnostic?) but I'd like to acknowledge as someone who grew up in an Islamic environment, mainstream Islam claims to be the only religion that only worships one God but actually idolizes many. God is just an empty name they say in prayer. Virtually every other faucet of Islam glorifies Muhummad. To be a Muslim, you must say a sentence in Arabic that puts God's name next to Muhummad. The Adhan call mentions only the names of God and Muhummad. The Kaaba in Saudi Arabia has the name God and Muhummad next to each other on the same level. Several mosques do this as well. Mosques are supposed to be \"houses of God alone\" but are designed green because it was Muhummad's favorite color. Muslims take a majority of their beliefs from Hadith and only use the Quran to recite because the Hadith tells them to. Otherwise they never use the Quran other than preach why it's so important. They don't mind you calling God by only Allah but gasp in horror if you don't follow Muhummad with \"peace be upon him\" or \"Prophet Muhummad\" or the other 6 billion ways to praise him that they would never do with God.  \nThis is quite ironic coming from the religion that asserts its authority on monotheism yet is so hellbent on praising Muhummad that I often see the most quoted Quran verses involve Muhummad despite the fact he's nearly never mentioned by name in it. Muslims even liked it when a Muslim rapper made a song called \"Muhummad Walks\" in response to \"Jesus Walks\" by Kanye West which shows how they compare Muhummad to Jesus in the Bible.  \nThe icing on the cake to all of this is, I've read the Quran and studied Islam and the Quran itself says all prophets, Muhummad included, are equal. I've mentioned this to several Muslims and they get furious and tell me I'm disrespecting their Holy Prophet. I remind them that God wrote the Quran, not me, so if they take issue with it, they argue with God, not me. But being as thin faced as they are, they blame me anyway.  \nA religion that focuses so hard on the idea of worshipping one God but left this huge hole in its ideology is living proof it's false and can't stand to reason.  \nThis was mainly intended towards Sunni Islam, which is the vast majority of Muslims.

As though my knowledge is minimal of Christianity and Christian history, (due to being an ex-Muslim atheist), it seems Protestant Reformation  was the primary reason why the authority of the Catholic Church was shaken so that the European Enlightenment, modernity, and secularism came out as a thing...\n\nI mean, look at it. Without Protestant Reformation, secularisation would not occur too. Protestant Reformation led to the weakening of the Catholic Church and its central authority all over Europe either this way or that. Lots of new denominations arose from this conflict (Anglicanism, Calvinism, Puritanism, Presbytarynism), and the abundance of these new denominations also resulted in a more pluralistic and tolerant Europe. Moreover, the general claims and motivations behind Protestantism could have also inspired Europe (and Christendom in general) to the idea of secularism. You know, like the ones that...\n\n\\-Everybody should be able to read Bible in their own language (it was dictated to be read in Latin by Catholic Church up until that time) \n\n\\-Every single baptised Christian happens to be his/her own priest and can interprete his/her understanding of Christianity just by reading the Bible\n\n\\-Printing press should be used as an agent for printing and distributing Bible in easier and cheaper ways to the Christians so that they won't need to be stuck under the ignorance Catholic Church itself rests upon\n\nThis might seem irrelevant at first but when you notice that the first countries which embraced secularism were also the first countries that have a remarkable population or heritage of Protestantism (or at least the ones that were gone through the Protestant Reformation): Britian, Denmark, Iceland, Netherlands, Finland, USA, Switzerland, Norway, South African Republic, Australia... \n\nThoughts?",

Humans, and kids, do this all the time: to understand a rock, it's actually useful to imagine a \"Mr. Rock\", that has all the attributes of that object. Another example is the 'Mr. Men' children's books, where the same thing is done to embody human characteristics – Mr. Clumsy, Mr. Grumpy, and so on.\n\nNow, although I don't directly believe that \"God, the creator of the universe\" is real, I *still* find it useful to have this conception of a \"Mr. Reality\" in my head. This might sound crazy, but you can also imagine that I can talk to this thing. I might ask it scientific questions such as \"Please; tell me how a car works? How exactly is that thing moving?\", and it might respond \"Well, why don't you take it apart and see for yourself?\". A fairly intense kind of conversation then ensues as I work out how the wheels move forward due to friction, how the wheels are connected to the axle/drive shaft, and how exactly the drive shaft is driven into spinning by the engine.\n\nPsychologically, I know this whole activity would obviously be labelled an \"**internal monologue**\". I am aware and conscious of the liklihood that no \"God\" of any sort exists outside of my own head. Yet, I feel strongly that such an imagined entity is almost essential for me to reason, for me to think about the world. I can't imagine thinking itself without it.\n\nSo, while it seems I am an atheist due to my lack of belief in some creator being, I do have this mickey-mouse, \"psychological God\" as the primary foundation of my understanding of the universe, as well as my personal life.

Here in France we have a state which has laïcité at the centre, which is a particular kind of secularism which actively prohibits religion from public life. In the past conservatives hated this, but since there are very few traditional Catholics left this principle has been adopted into French nationalism, and primarily effects Muslims because Muslims tend to be more religious and have outward sighs of religion such as hijab. Since the majority of Arabs and black people in this country are religious Muslims and religious Muslim women always wear visible religious garments, this means about 1/5 or 1/6 of all French women are basically excluded from public life, this proportion is even larger in cities and among the young, so perhaps 1/4 or nearly 1/3 of young women in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and elsewhere are excluded. This, all progressive people should agree, is not an acceptable situation, that none of these women can become teachers, lawyers and judges, civil servants or politicians, but some people justify this by saying that they are not banned for their race or religion but their clothing, however this is ridiculous because in this case race, religion and clothing are all connected. To give an example for American or British people, imagine if people with braids in their hair were not allowed to be teachers, even though this would not technically be a ban on black people being teachers but it would practically be that way, you demand that they have to give up a part of themselves to be part of their own country and most would not do that and they shouldn’t. This situation is made worse because the older generation, and even conservatives and liberals in the younger generation, like to deny that race exists in France.\n\nAs a feminist and anti-racist it is not acceptable to me that any woman or person of colour is excluded from public life, but especially not such a large minority of women and the large majority of women of colour, but as an atheist who believes that religion does cause oppression of women I feel not so comfortable arguing for the hijab.",

Is it worth it purely from a curiosity point of view?\n\nEdit: So I started reading. I’m on Chapter 6 of Genesis and I’ve had to wiki several times already. Questions like where tf did Cain’s wife come from? Is that not incest? And who was Lilith and why isn’t she mentioned? And why does Lamech get two wives..? I’m so confused already. ",

  "selftext": "So if you’re confused about Americas undying support for Israel no matter what they do let me explain what I was taught growing up. Now I’m sure having a good ally in the area was a factor to but I’m sure Christians mixed with the persecution the Jewish people helped the Israel state get to a place that the state couldn’t be questioned about how it treats the Palestinians. \n\nSo we were taught that the Jews were gods chosen people. We were taught that Israel was the land god gave the Jews. We were told stories about how god helped the Jews conquer the land and kill all the evil people inhabiting the land of gods people. We were taught the Jews would one day return and take there land. We were the most powerful voting base in America. How do you think this affected the policy towards Israel. The government of Israel knows this and thinks it can get away with anything. The government of Israel will wage an endless war as long as it thinks it will gain power.",

It just doesn’t seems to make sense that God would create humans and hold them accountable if he knew they would sin already. God created humans the way they are so he should know their limitations. If I create a turtle without legs I should not punish it for not being able to walk surely in the same way God shouldn’t punish a human for not being able to not sin. Additionally why are there so many religions. How come if I’m born in Dubai or Thailand I’m much less likely to accept “the true way to heaven”. Should god not judge us on what is given to us?? Additionally it seems Jesus contradicts himself being god over and over saying “father why have you forsaken me”, not knowing the hour, and even saying the father is greater than I. It doesn’t make sense but I sincerely want it to be true. It would truly be amazing if God watched over you and offered protection and support through life, and that even when you betray him (sin) you repent and he will take the burden. I just don’t know if it’s true. It feels like there is evidence against but little evidence for. If god created me the way he created me, doubtful and wishing for a rational explanation of why Jesus is the way. Then why would he punish me for the very thing he instilled within me.",

I was raised in a fairly religious family, but later when i became more skeptical, i became an atheist. And naturally, i do not believe there is any god or afterlife in sense that they are described,\n\n But here is the reason of my worry: the claim, i've seen many people make: that we can't know for sure what happens after we die. Even despite all evidence that consciousness is tied to brain, that it's fragile to damage, and that there is no evidence that it will emerge in the future, the thought about lack of our knowledge about universe, upsets me a lot. \n\nWhen i talk to people about it, they say: \"So what? Even if it's true, just don't worry about it\", but for some reason this just doesn't work for me. What does work, is the evidence that we are our brains and that we cease to exist with death. But then again, the question emerges: \"But what we don't know everything, how can we be sure?\" My mental rebuttal is usually something like: \"We have no evidence for it neither\" , \"the lack of our general knowledge , but it idoes not mean we can't cocnclude something based on observetions.\", \"If we assume there is no afterlife, we still would have no idea about it because we can't measure something that does not exist\", or \"if there was something resembling a soul or something that can exist after death there would probably be evidence\", but it is still tortures me. \n\nDespite everything, I still feel anxious and confused. I want and will seek therapy, but i am really scared that the therapist would choose the \"Eh, just don't think much about it and live in present day\" approach, which is reasonable, but is still not very good for me, in the sense of my mental state. Sometimes i try to assume that there is afterlife after all, and try to imagine how would that impact my life, and.. honestly, it makes me scared for some reason. I don't want to experience eternity. Even if the experience will not be painful by itself, like, for example, in concept of hell. \n\nCan my fear be debunked somehow? Is ot really reasonable to assume that \"we don't know for sure what happens after\"? I really want to enjoy my life to the fullest, but this thing just doesn't let me relax until i at least get reassurance that afterlife or some kind of consciousness after death is highly highly unlikely.  \n\n\nEdit: added paragraphs ",

I’ve got a number of questions below, and if you could answer any number of them, I’d find that a massive help!\n\n\r  \nTIA :)\n\n\r  \nWhat was it like to lose your previous religious worldview? \n\n\r  \nWas there a period of disorientation? Depression? (I suspect that there was relief for some, but I also imagine that giving up something like religion brings other feelings as well?)\n\n\r  \nWas there a search for meaning afterward? What did that look like?\r  \n",

  "title": "Do you have any thoughts about a specific parable about a vineyard?",
  "selftext": "The parable is in Matthew 20. Spoilers for that section in the Bible (/s). It’s about a vineyard owner who hires people to work throughout the day, then later goes to hire workers in the afternoon, and then late at night only one hour before the working day is over. The owner then proceeds to pay the workers all the same amount, regardless of how long they worked. The owner justified his actions by how the daily wage was what they all agreed on, and he was allowed to be generous to those who otherwise wouldn’t have gotten enough money to feed their families for the day.\n\nSomething about it doesn’t feel quite right to me, but I can’t put it into words just yet. Mostly because the church my family goes to (still closeted so I have to go with them) explained the parable as part of their homily. I don’t trust anything the church says in the Bible as good to be an actual good thing, so I thought I’d ask the subreddit here.",

The only reason why it’s still active is because people want to believe that there is something more to life and they want to believe that they’re loved ones go to beautiful resting place and that they’re hated ones go somewhere where they are punished for they’re actions. There is also the fact that almost all religions have a story of someone quitting and then something horrible happens to them and they’re family, thereby scaring people into staying\nTruly an horrible and vicious scam.",

  "title": "Neo-Pagans and Neo-Folk Religion?",
  "selftext": "Hello, I am not a athetist personally but I am curious about the subs opinion on these more disorganised and less popular religions. \n\nI would assume it would be a mixed bag and generally it’s safe to assume many folk faiths and beliefs are less popular and as a result get less media attention as a result. Do you feel any negatively towards these on the same scale as Christianity, more or less? \n\nThe reason I ask is that I see the majority of atheism in opposition to the key major religions, which is understandable since they control governments, make up sizeable chunks of the population ect, so maybe Paganism, Neo-Paganism ect is less offensive and therefore more passable / less easily criticised\n\nI would imagine it would be something split between practical and pragmatic and ideological?  I can see arguments from both. I would imagine on the one hand it’s damaging since in many ways it’s a new religion and some variants (especially ones co-opted by Nazi’s) can be dangerous (I acknowledge all faiths can be) however on the many hand they lack many of the flaws of traditional organised religions and often are more ironically modernist in their outlook (some aren’t, but as a generalisation) \n\nI would also like to hear thoughts about mythology such as Native American beliefs, just out of curiosity so that I can see the sort of opinions people have on the topic.",

  "title": "Opinions on liberal/progressive Christians?",
  "selftext": "I just discovered a sub r/OpenChristian to understand Christianity from the perspective of religious liberals who don't think that they're obligated to hate LGBTQ people and women.\n\nI have odd feeling regarding religion and especially Christianity. I've been an atheist all my life and always associated Christianity with bigotry, judgement, violence and authority. But at the same time, I craved for seeing some bright side of it.\n\nTo explain myself, I identify as militant anti theist atheist who sees religion as nothing but utter nonsense that has no bearing on life in 21st century and a grift to grab money from naive people. But in spite of that, there's some hidden part of me that wants to see Christianity as a force of good. So I visited the aforementioned sub and there's been a few interesting perspectives. Like it appears that all those archaic purity rules are actually outdated and have no bearing on living righteous life in 2023 and that things like condemning homosexuality and abortion are out of context. And if I understand correctly, religion is all in all about Jesus Christ's desire for his followers to love their neighbor and to treat others as they want to be treated and from some other source, I heard a sentiment that it's straight up insulting to read the Bible and the only takeaway is that gay people and women are evil.\n\nThey definitely make it sound like an appealing religion of love and co-existence that would fit my values. Of course, at the same time, no version of Christianity can really appeal to me to convince me to join it, because I don't think that there's anything sentient that passes judgement on anyone on this tiny planet and I don't think that forgiveness from aforementioned hypothetical entity is something to strive for. I'm an imperfect man who makes mistakes AND understands emotion to feel the urge to do good from within. I don't need to wrap my basic humanity into superstition and the idea that I'm inherently evil, for reasons. I definitely don't need to sound like fruitcake explaining my kindness. My brain has developed immune system to fight off the notion that my conscience is of supernatural origin.\n\nAll in all, how do you perceive liberal Christianity? Most Democratic politicians in America identify as such and I'm wondering if it's genuine feeling or just soulless pandering. Once again, even though I'm a militant anti-theist, I'm also eternal optimist hoping to see the good side of religion winning over religious bigotry and oppression and enlighten the world before religion in general goes away.\n\nSo from your own experience and judgement, do you see some future in the good side of Christianity and see liberal Christians as allies or do you think that Christianity is pure evil that some people find able to escape with the help of liberal mental gymnastics?",

There's one lingering issue though. I'm still terrified of the end of the world happening and being \"Judged\" and being sent to hell now I've never done anything horrible in my lifetime but you can do the most mundane things according to religious text that are considered \"sins\" and be sent to hell now I don't believe in this stuff but for some reason whenever somebody brings it up I still fear it and I just am Terrified and I just can't figure out why.
