  "selftext": "I live in America. I own 1 gun for protection, and if I had to give it up tomorrow due to an outright gun ban, I wouldn't give a shit. Ignoring the fact that the US government would never in a million years even attempt this in the first place, even if they did, there are millions of unregistered guns that would just stay in the owner's possession and we'd never know.\n\nThen you end up in a situation where all the registered gun owners have now given up their guns, but also know that most of the people they wanted to protect themselves from are still in possession of their unregistered guns, so the now gunless people will just find a gun via illegal means, and just keep it hidden at home. Millions of people will wanna do this, and now there is just a much larger black market for guns, and anyone can get one if they really want one (which they will) and we will be back where we started, where everyone still has a gun that wanted one in the first place.\n\nI also think \"fixing the mental health crisis\" is maybe even a more impossible task. That relies on these people willingly getting help for their problems, which completely flies in the face of the macho \"suck it up or i'll give you something to cry about\" culture that every male has instilled in them growing up, and many have not grown out of as an adult. \n\nI really see no solution to this, and even if there was one, I think we have too many lunatics that would rather let the problem continue than give up their guns, which is absolutely insane to me.",

  "title": "CMV: the incidence of people’s drinks being spiked is greatly exaggerated online",
  "selftext": "In particular, if someone on the Internet claims that they were roofied, my assumption is that they are mistaken, unless their story has evidence external to their own feeling, e.g. the following:\n\n* an actual positive drug test\n\n* somebody seeing someone put something in their drink, or seeing something in their drink\n\n* someone getting caught in the vicinity with a drink-spiking drug on their person\n\nOftentimes, the story amounts to “I felt way more drunk/out of it than I normally do based on how many drinks I remember having”, which I don’t find very convincing.\n\nAs for why:\n\n**First**, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug-facilitated_sexual_assault) cites various studies all of which show a huge rate of negatives when suspected cases are actually tested:\n\n> One study of 1,179 urine specimens from victims of suspected DFSAs in 49 American states found six (0.5%) positive for Rohypnol, 97 (8%) positive for other benzodiazepines, 451 (38%) positive for alcohol and 468 (40%) negative for any of the drugs tested for. A similar study of 2,003 urine samples of victims of suspected DFSAs found less than 2% tested positive for Rohypnol or GHB. A three-year study in the UK found two percent of 1,014 rape victims had sedatives detected in their urine 12 hours after the assault. A 2009 Australian study found that of 97 instances of patients admitted to hospital believing their drinks might have been spiked, tests were unable to identify a single case where a sedative drug was likely to have been illegally placed in a drink in a pub or nightclub, with 9 plausible cases from within the study. In contrast, the mean blood ethanol concentration (BAC) of patients at the time of presentation was 0.096%. One study (Ham & Burton, 2005), found out of 1014 cases of claimed drug-facilitated sexual assault over a three-year period in the UK, only 2% (21 cases) showed evidence of possible deliberate spiking.\n\n> A UK study concluded that there was \"no evidence to suggest widespread date rape drug use\" in the UK and that no cases in 120 examined involved rohypnol and just two involved GHB.\n\nAnd more broadly the lack of other evidence.  Do you ever hear about people caught bringing roofies into bars or clubs?  Are there ever roofie drug busts?  I’ve heard several times about people inventing date rape drug detecting straws - how often do they produce a positive?  These drugs seem like the sort of thing that could easily lead to an overdose, if being maliciously drugged by a random person, especially when mixed with alcohol and/or other drugs - do you ever hear about deaths from roofies?  I bet if one girl died from roofie OD at a frat party it would be national news!\n\n**Second**, the main evidence that being roofied is common, is that a lot of people think it happened to them - but most of the stories I see are “I felt way drunker than I should have been”, and people only assume that it was a drink spiking because of the perception that it’s common.\n\nIt’s circular!\n\nAnd most habitual drinkers will admit to having gotten drunker than they intended, in situations where being roofied wasn’t a possibility.\n\n**Third**, people are famously bad at assessing risk, and overestimate the danger from exotic, unusual risks relative to more mundane ones.  So e.g. overestimate the danger from a plane crash, relative to a car crash.  Given this bias, people will fear being roofied more than they fear drinking too much alcohol. \n\nThis wouldn’t be the first time a fear like that was overblown due to media coverage and word of mouth - razor blades in Halloween candy, satanic ritual abuse in daycare centers, kids becoming murderers due to backwards messages in rock songs. And, I suspect, the recent epidemic of claimed \"[needle spiking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_spiking)\", including the case of a concert [security guard](https://nypost.com/2021/11/06/astroworld-security-guard-pricked-in-neck-with-needle-houston-police-say/) whose [case](https://www.wfla.com/news/national/needle-spiking-astroworld-attendees-may-have-been-injected-with-drugs-during-crowd-surge-police-say/) was [widely](https://www.newsweek.com/what-needle-spiking-astroworld-drugging-reports-investigated-after-tragic-event-1646944) [reported](https://allnurses.com/confirmed-needle-spiking-astroworld-festival-t739290/) in the [US](https://www.the-sun.com/news/4040629/astroworld-what-is-needle-spiking/), the [retraction](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/astroworld-security-guard-needle-police-corrected-9658070/), not so much.\n\n**Final point** - to be clear I am **not** talking about the following:\n\n* spiking drinks with alcohol\n\n* pressuring people into taking drugs or alcohol\n\n* taking advantage of someone who is un- or semi-conscious from drugs or alcohol\n\n* Countries other than the US, I would guess similar countries are similar but don’t really know enough about them",

  "title": "CMV: Military age should be 21, not 18",
  "selftext": "Raise the military enlistment age to 21, too.\n\nWhether it's because of personal or parental failure, 18 year old \"adults\" who don't know how to take care of themselves don't belong in a career field where they need to know how to take care of each-other in turn. Someone who doesn't know how or has no real experience governing their own wellbeing or behavior is not only a hindrance to themselves, but to every other soldier in their unit. Maybe instead of throwing together a bunch of people who've barely set foot out their parents' doorstep into situations where people may die, maybe the military will be far better off drawing from a recruiting pool of actual adults who are more likely to at least know SOMETHING of stability and self control. \n\nObviously, this doesn't apply to every single young person in that age range, there are always going to be exceptions. But at 18, you should absolutely know how to wash your own clothes and track your own finances, in other words how to do the absolute bare minimum to be functional. From the web - I served with entirely too many \"adults\" who apparently needed their hands held through even the most basic functions of otherwise normal adult life, and I'm supposed to trust them with a loaded firearm in a combat situation? These kids couldn't be trusted with so much as a butter-knife! Also, no one wants to share a bunker or barracks with someone who doesn't know how to clean up after themselves, or clean THEMSELVES. Poor hygiene is a pest & disease hazard, which can devastate an otherwise functional unit. And guess which age range tends to not understand this very basic life skill? \n\nAlso, I'm sure there are A LOT of NCO's out there who'd love nothing more than not having to deal with disciplining a soldier getting busted for underage drinking: If you lack the discipline to not break the law out of personal selfishness, be it with alcohol or (especially) sexual assault, then you straight-up lack the discipline to be a soldier.\n\nPeople have long criticized the US military for \"recruiting kids,\" and after having been a part of that system myself I'm inclined to agree that these criticisms are absolutely valid. The military can be a fulfilling career with unique opportunities for anyone willing and able to work hard and push themselves, but it is first and foremost a job for adults who can do adult things to an adult capacity. \n\nTo add onto this, as mentioned, the drinking age is 21, you have to be 21 to smoke cigarettes, and 21 to even get into a nightclub, and they say that adolescence can still be occurring up to the age of 25, so I don’t think an 18-year-old really has the wherewithal to make such a decision to enter into a career that could end their lives.\n\nAnother story -\n\nI was 18 years old when I signed a four year contract with the US Army. By 19 I had the first shots taken at me.\n\nYet, I was unable to buy a beer. Somehow that requires more maturity than getting shot at or carrying around a machine gun with lots of live ammunition. And before someone (who never served) tries to say that “you’ll be under supervision from higher ups as lower enlisted” I can assure you that there were countless times in the military when I was under 21 that I was left alone with a lot of firepower. You think a 24 year old sergeant is pulling a 1 AM guard shift in the tower next to the machine gun? Think again. They’re sleeping homey.\n\nNow we are at the point in this country where in most places the age to buy a pack of cigarettes is 21 too. \n\nPeople overwhelmingly support this because of the “smoking and drinking problem with kids” and “concern for their health.” There are likely many who while didn’t support it outright said jack shit about it when these laws were passed, so they supported it through apathy. The public outcry was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.\n\nYou know what is really bad for your health? War. But wait a minute ago you were arguing about the health of kids…I never heard myself called a kid when they handed me an M240b and had me jump out of an airplane. \n\nYeah, smoking isn’t a bright idea. And neither is excessive drinking. But if I am an adult enough to go die in some undeclared war, I should be able to make my own choices in the matter. If I am not an adult, then I should be nowhere near a military formation.\n\nTherefore age to join the military should be raised to 21 to coincide with the alcohol and tobacco laws. Most people join the military straight out of high school when they’re 18, or going to college for a year or two and dropping out due to a lack of discipline. The majority of people in my basic training were 18-20 years old.\n\nIf the age to join the military was raised to 21, the ranks would dwindle down. High school graduates would end up going to trade schools or community colleges instead of enlisting. Our military is already struggling because too many people are too fat or have too many criminal charges to join. And the political wokeness of the current military is turning off a lot of potential recruits too (like it or not it’s the truth.) This change would be the nail in the coffin for our numbers. Then our masters…erm I mean elected representatives would have only one choice: Start treating 18 year olds as adults.\n\nIf you think an 18 year old should be able to join our military and die, but can’t have a cigarette and a beer after coming home from war (assuming they actually come home at all,) then you are wrong. Any argument to the contrary is bullshit. \n\nYou’re either a kid or an adult. You can’t be one or the other depending on when it serves the system’s interests. So pick one standard and stick with it.\n\nAlso thank you to all the shopkeepers out there that broke these laws because they knew they were immoral and sold us booze anyway back then. You were hard to find but when we did we really appreciated it. I hope you never got caught. Thank you for supporting the troops!",

  "title": "CMV: The 2005 film “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” is NOT any closer to Roald Dahl’s book than the 1971 film “Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory”, and is a worse film that Dahl probably would’ve hated",
  "selftext": "Any time discussion of any kind, particularly criticism, about the Tim Burton/Johnny Depp 2005 film adaptation “Charlie & the Chocolate Factory” is brought up, one of the first things fans of that movie tend to say is that “it was closer to the book” and “Roald Dahl hated the 1971 movie”. I’m going to argue the points that no it was not closer to the book, and that Roald Dahl would’ve hated the 2005 movie as much, or perhaps more, than the 1971 original.\n\nSome of the main arguments I’ve heard for why the 1971 film is not as close to the book are that it is essentially a musical unlike the book, it didn’t contain as many references to the book, Johnny Depp’s Wonka is closer to the book than Gene Wilder’s, and that it added a non-book subplot about a Wonka operative posing as Slugworth who tested all the winning ticket holders to ensure they wouldn’t give away Wonka’s secret Everlasting Gobstopper formula. Here are my points countering those arguments:\n\n- The original book (and the 2005 film) are no less “musicals” than the 1971 film, as they feature four musical numbers sung by Oompa Loompas. The 1971 film does add additional songs, but this is no different than the 2005 film which *also* adds an additional musical piece to the narrative (that isn’t in the book), “Wonka’s Welcome Song”. Burton’s film also removes Book Wonka’s terrifying poetic narrative sing-song “*There’s no earthly way of knowing, which direction they are going. There’s no knowing where they’re rowing, or which way the river’s flowing*”… which IS in the 1971 film.\n\n- In terms of references to the book, two examples often used are Prince Pondicherry’s chocolate mansion and the squirrel nut room where Veruca Salt meets her demise. I’d argue that these are unfair points because the prospect of filming those two things in a low-budget 1971 movie were almost impossible. Creating a real practical melting chocolate mansion is virtually impossible, and it was of course all CGI in the 2005 film. They changed the squirrel nut room to a golden goose room in 1971 because CGI didn’t exist to create squirrels, and real trained squirrels wouldn’t have been able to interact safety with Veruca’s actress. In the 2005 film they did use real trained squirrels for some scenes, but NOT for the scenes where the squirrels interact with Veruca. That was all CGI, for obvious reasons. Two counterexamples are (1) the book’s Boat Ride poem Wonka recites, which was removed from the 2005 film but remained in the 1971 film, and (2) the book’s Wonka coming out to greet the guests at the gate with a cane and speaking to each of them asking for the Golden Tickets, which was nerfed in the 2005 film in favor of the “Wonka Welcome Song” puppet show. The 2005 film also did many more things which subtracted from the book, such as Charlie wanting to sell his Golden Ticket for cash (something a kid, especially one as excited for the Ticket as Charlie, would NEVER do), and Wonka initially telling Charlie he couldn’t bring his family to the factory. None of these things “couldn’t feasibly be done in 2005” like can be said about 1971.\n\n- Johnny Depp’s Wonka. Jesus, where to begin. If people really believe his performance was closer to Book Wonka than Gene Wilder, I don’t know where to begin to address how wrong I think that is. Depp’s performance with its social ineptness and Michael Jackson vibes is NOTHING like the Book Wonka, who definitely has a way with words and isn’t at all awkward in speaking with the guests like Depp’s Wonka is. Gene Wilder’s Wonka has the same characteristics as Book Wonka, where he speaks in a socially competent way and always has lots to say, none of which is ridiculously impossible to understand like Depp’s Wonka. The sinister undertones of Book Wonka is seen in spades with Wilder’s performance, such as the boat poem scene (itself in the book), but is pretty much nonexistent in Depp’s Wonka who is nothing more than a vacuous manchild with Daddy Issues who no one in their right mind could imagine as running an entire factory by himself. I can believe the Book Wonka & Gene Wilder’s Wonka own and run a factory and make chocolate, I can NOT believe Depp’s Wonka does. Wilder’s Wonka uses many more quotes direct from the book than Depp’s Wonka, and pulls them off perfectly.\n\n- Regarding the Slugworth subplot, the 2005 film also added a significant subplot that wasn’t in the book at all, regarding Wonka’s Dentist Father. Both of these added subplots change the course of the story, and I would argue that the 2005 subplot shifts the entire focus of the narrative onto Wonka and his issues instead of Charlie, whereas the 1971 subplot ENHANCES the story’s focus on Charlie’s character. We don’t see Wonka at all until halfway through the 1971 movie, so the entire first half of the film focuses exclusively on Charlie. One of the main reasons Roald Dahl said he disliked the 1971 film is because it “focused too much on Wonka instead of Charlie”, which the 2005 film did in a FAR GREATER capacity. So logically, Dahl would’ve *disliked the 2005 movie more* for this point alone. \n\nIn terms of why I think the 1971 movie is a better overall movie as well… many have said that the 1971 Fizzy Lifting Drinks scene “compromises” Charlie’s character, but it was actually Grandpa Joe’s idea to drink, and Wonka’s rant at the end is aimed almost entirely at Joe instead of Charlie who essentially was peer-pressured into doing something any kid would jump at the chance to do. This allows Charlie’s character to really shine through at the end when he returns the Everlasting Gobstopper despite all temptation not to, instead of having him just be a goody-two-shoes the whole time, and making him feel more like a real kid and a fully rounded character. The music is also timeless and classic, including “The Candy Man” and “Pure Imagination” which have been covered dozens of times by many artists and the latter of which is so solidly associated with the brand that it was reprised in the 2023 prequel film “Wonka”. Wilder’s performance is also not only excellent, but does as I argued more closely resemble the Wonka of the book when compared to Depp’s performance. This is not to say Wilder’s Wonka is identical to the Book Wonka, but it’s a lot closer than Depp’s.\n\nI know there are many more intricacies involved in these two films and the book, so it’s nearly impossible to include every argument and counterargument here without writing ANOTHER book, and I’m not out here to compete with Roald Dahl. But I know others may have many more arguments and counterarguments which I would love to entertain, and I am certainly open to Changing My View!",

  "selftext": "I see the panspermia hypothesis floated *very* frequently as an alternative to abiogenesis having taken place on Earth.  Panspermia, as I understand it, is the idea that life, in its early stages originated elsewhere and was kicked up by cosmic dust or meteoroid impacts from another location either inside or outside the Solar System.  \n\n*While I do not believe panspermia is impossible*, I do not understand why this idea gets so much airtime as an explanation for the presence of life on Earth.  I believe that panspermia is not a well-supported scientific idea and is not especially useful.  Here's why:\n\n1. Occam's Razor.  It multiplies entities beyond explanatory necessity.  It doesn't solve the problem of the difficulty of abiogenesis; it just moves it somewhere else.  Now you need abiogenesis AND hardy microbes capable of surviving in space WHICH ALSO were able to survive on Earth.\n2. It's borderline unfalsifiable.  How would it be falsified?\n3. As far as I know, we have no positive evidence that this is how life reached Earth.\n\nFrom what I can gather, the appeal of the idea has to do more with vibes than science.  People like the idea, but there's little to no affirmative evidence to support it.\n\nThe idea of directed panspermia sounds even less plausible to me.  Evolution of life on Earth was such a complex and contingent phenomenon.  What result would a civilization about four billion years ago be hoping to get?  Nothing about the biosphere Earth got was inevitable.\n\nIs there a scientific rather than a merely emotive reason this idea is taken so seriously?  Is there any actual scientific evidence supporting the idea that panspermia is more likely than not how life reached Earth of which I am not aware that might change my mind?\n\nTwo caveats.  One, I am NOT claiming that panspermia is impossible.  Two, I am not talking about some softer version of it by which chemicals from outside of Earth, hit Earth and aided in abiogenesis here.  I am talking about abiogenesis happening elsewhere INSTEAD OF on Earth and being the origin of life on this planet.\n\nEDIT:U apologize if the tone of the original post was excessively confrontational.

When the media needs to chase an audience they are no longer reporting the news and trying to minimize the bias in their reporting.\n\nThe BBC News has beat reporters and doesn't need to chase money.  They can be run like an old school news agency.  They could have access by law.

This is the best way I've come up with to put that influence back into the world.

If the employer/landlord is thinking about rescinding the conditional offer, they give the applicant a limited time to respond to either show that the background check is inaccurate or show mitigating evidence to show let them know that they're making efforts to become a productive member of society.\n\nWhile these laws are a step in the right direction to make it easier for formerly incarcerated individuals to get a job and/or house. I think that it's going to take more than just a law and an idea for the formerly incarcerated individual to reintegrate back into society because of the following points:\n\n1. Laws don't really change the behavior of the Employers/Landlords. They will always find some way to use the criminal record against the applicant and often cite liability and risk to the public which, from what I've seen, is virtually nonexistent.\n\n2. Employers/Landlords don't seem to have a laid-out criteria of which type of crimes to weed out. Without this, the formerly incarcerated individual is left with uncertainty on whether or not people would be willing to give a chance and which kind of careers to invest time in.\n\n3. There's little to no punitive measures (i.e. fines, criminal charges) against this type of discrimination. Sure they may be sentenced to training, but will the offending landlord/employer comply with the laws to ensure no violations happen again? This type of deterrence without any punitive consequence seems like a slap on the wrist quite frankly.\n\n4. There's little to no statistics or research that shows that these laws are working. This also goes hand-in-hand with the point number 2. Often times they aren't transparent of whether or not employers/landlords are willing to follow through with their promises.\n\nIt's still a relatively new idea, and it's going to take decades for other counties, cities, and states to follow. While society seems open to the idea of reintegration, there's a lot more barriers that is being placed onto formerly incarcerated individuals than may be commonly believed. I don't have a particularly positive outlook on these type of laws having a significantly positive effect overall, but maybe I'm being too negative here.\n\nI do hope to hear encouragement here.\n\nCMV Reddit!",

  "title": "cmv:The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education is better than the Central Board of Secondary Education.",
  "selftext": "The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education is a better board than the Central Board of Secondary Education.\n\nThe 1st reason is that the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education has a denser and more stressful syllabus than the Central Board of Secondary Education. This makes students of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education more knowledgable than students in the Central Board of Secondary Education. Students who study in the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education learn how to handle pressure and to elucubrate, due to studying for long hours. This is a life skill important in real life. Additionally, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education splits up into 11 subjects in Class 7 rather than Class 11 for the Central Board of Secondary Education, students who study in the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education know how to focus on multiple priorities easily.\n\nMy 2nd reason is the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education leaves its students with impressive elocution skills, comprehension skills, and writing skills in English, their mother-tongue, and a 3rd-language! Being fluent in one's mother-tongue is useful, since mother-tongues connect a person to their roots! Moreso, English is the lingua-franca of the world, which results in being well-versed in English pivotal for surviving currently! Additionally, learning a 3rd-language of one's choice is also important if they want to move outside of India, and go to a country that is located outside of the Anglosphere, such as Deustchland or France! Meanwhile, students studying in the Central Board of Secondary Education are only well-versed in their mother-tongue, and have limited capabilities in English!\n\nMy 3rd reason is the a graduate of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education had more opportunities than a graduate of the Central Board of Secondary Education. While a graduate of the Central Board of Secondary Education can only study in India via participating in the Joint Entrance Examinations, the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, etc, and then finally going to the Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, etc. Meanwhile, a graduate of the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education can not only do all of the above, but also go to prestigious colleges in other countries, such as Oxford, Harvard, Yales, etc. This means that they have a greater chance of success, since going to a college like Oxford is easier than going to a college like the Indian Institute of Technology or the Indian Institute of Management.",

  "selftext": "Of course there are some schools which still fail students, however there is also many articles written about the difficulty of failing students. How it's become far less prevelant throughout the years, and thy that's a bad thing. If you peruse the teachers sub you'll also see there tons of anecdotal stories to support this. \n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2017/dec/16/secret-teacher-pupils-fail-targets-missed-revision-workload-pressure\n\n\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/90252729/kids-arent-failing-school-school-is-failing-kids\n\nThere's also a racial aspect to this. With the naacp launching a lawsuit against one school district who kept passing a student, all the way through getting a diploma, while the student was functionally illiterate. The case claimed his civil rights were denied because he was not given an education.\n\nhttps://edsource.org/2022/the-right-to-read-it-took-a-lawsuit-against-california/678069\n\nWorth noting, students in predominantly white districts are often held to very different standards in the same state. Certain behaviors are tolerated and worse yet, actually getting worse grades is considered passing. This creates two tiers of an education system that's also based on race to a degree. \n\nBut it gets worse. Because these students then come out of high school knowing less, but they go on to college, often going into debt, and then they quit after realizing they're nowhere near the level which it takes to pass a college level course. This sets up these students for even worse prospects in life. Worth noting, this is also why California quietly ended affirmative action admissions years ago  at many state universities. It was having negative repercussions for students of color. \n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2023/06/30/1185226895/heres-what-happened-when-affirmative-action-ended-at-california-public-colleges\n\nStudents who have learning disabilities or need special help can also request it in this system. It's called an IEP and this allows for accommodations for their disability. So a student can get extra time, or individual tutoring should they fall behind. If they really want to, they're going to pass. \n\nAnd this isn't even touching on the grade inflation we've seen on the last couple decades. C level work is now considered A level. Curriculums have been dumbed down to the point where showing up and doing the bare minimum is enough. Well, fsr less than the bare minimum. The numbers themselves are pretty shocking. Whereas it's common for predominantly white school districts to have around 85% on grade level, in many cities across the us this drops to just 25% of black students in cities like Philadelphia and Cleveland. \n\nhttps://www.realcleareducation.com/articles/2022/11/24/large_racial_reading_and_math_performance_gaps_persist_as_children_age_110794.html\n\nThe answer isn't to continue to just pass everyone with a heartbeat, but have actual repercussions for students. Of course some accommodations should be made and in some instances students should be able to retake certain tests, but overall as it currently stands, there's not much a school will do to a student who is far below grade level, and also having multiple absences. The approach now is just to push them along. This creates a situation that's worse for everyone. The student, the other kids in the class, the teacher, and the district.",

  "title": "CMV: News reports of small, individual incidents should not be covered by national/international news sources.",
  "selftext": "If you look at the front page of /r/news , more often than not you'll see a lot of local, isolated incidents. [Here's what it looks like right now](https://imgur.com/a/ZDl1UE5) - at least 4 of the top 20 posts are one-off clickbait articles (marked in red) and maybe another 3 that have questionable value to a non-local audience (marked in yellow). \"Parents fuming after Montreal-area teacher allegedly lists students' art for sale online\" is #3. \"Warrant: 12-year-old boy found cold, stiff at NC wilderness camp\" is #7. Is there any actual value in reporting these incidents to a national or even international audience?\n\nThe world seems to be more and more afraid - afraid of other people, afraid of scary group X, afraid of diseases that might not even exist. People feel like violent crime is on the rise, even when statistics show the opposite. I think this fear comes from the constant exposure to the entire world's terrible events, even the small stuff that happens thousands of miles away. This type of news reporting fills us with a constant feeling of dread and allows us to be easily manipulated into false beliefs about the world. Covering these small news stories leads to a lot of problems:\n\n- It's easy to push a specific narrative through selective coverage. Want to push islamophobia? Publish every random incident of a Muslim immigrant attacking someone, but don't cover the violence committed by other groups. Want to make people think that trans people are a huge problem? Report on every time that a trans athlete wins something (and ignore all of the times that they don't). These stories almost always ignore context and don't report actual statistics, and they're usually emotionally charged in some way. \n\n- We have a finite amount of attention to give to news, these stories overwhelm our attention and allow more important news to slip by. \n\n- Excessive coverage of terrible things happening in the world erode our faith in humanity and promote an unhealthy sense of nihilism. If you're only shown terrible examples of human behavior (without mentioning the actual statistics and/or context of that behavior), why bother trying to improve things or help people?\n\n- These problems are even more exaggerated with news sharing/aggregation on sites like Reddit or Facebook, as they encourage people to only read headlines and to overlook news sources.\n\nI believe that these one-off incidences should really only be covered by local news, and they shouldn't be shoved into headlines read by far away readers unless they actually have some significance to that audience. I'm aware that this is where things get murky - how do you define \"significance\"? At a bare minimum, if a national news organization is showing me an article about a random incident between a few people across the country, they need to provide a wider context and address why it's an important event that non-locals should care about. \n\nThere's one place where my view gets tripped up, and it's why I'm posting this CMV. There have been small, isolated incidents whose coverage becomes symbolic of actual, larger issues. The murder of George Floyd is an example - without the horrific coverage of his death, we might not be having a national conversation about justice reform. Obviously we had had plenty of articles and evidence of police brutality before George Floyd, but the first hand videos of the event forced America face to face with a major issue. We do need to be aware of issues in order to face them, and this type of coverage did help us get more aware.\n\nIt's not useful for anyone to read an article about a random mom killing her children 2000 miles away. Instead, publish an article that looks at the statistics of parent-child killings, common warning signs, and places where resources for parents could be improved to address possible causes.",

  "selftext": "This is my first CMV post but I've always been fascinated by this sub, so I hope I do it right. Okay. So I won't make it too long, but I've held this position for years and it has recently been crystallized into a more clear and communicable idea, after Robert Sapolsky's new book came out (and he has done a whirlwind tour of podcast interviews that I have consumed).\n\nI want to start with what this CMV is NOT:\n\n* It's not an attempt to argue that free will does not exist,\n* It's not a discussion about the deterministic universe\n* It's not an argument that not believing in free will makes you inherently more moral or a better person.\n\nI also want to generally exclude discussions of 'compatibilism', as the idea that free will is a descriptor of behaviour, while interesting,  is not the kind of free will I am talking about. I am talking about Libertarian Free Will (that we have some ability to act outside of the influence of the natural, material world).\n\nWhat it IS, is a post where I make the argument that to be a person who holds moral beliefs that I think the majority of human (or maybe specifically western) society aligns with, discarding the belief in Free Will is incredibly helpful. Further, it aligns with many of the ideas that we increasingly share about empathy, compassion, and justice.\n\nBelieving we lack 'free will' allows us to approach harmful behaviors with more understanding and focus on solutions, thus creating a more compassionate and just society.  Let me give an example...\n\nWhen we think of people as products of their environments and genetics, then we are more capable of navigating their behavior in a way that does not blame them when something goes 'awry'. For this example, let's say a 40-year-old man was arrested for a violent outburst in a shopping center. People think he is disgusting and maybe say all kinds of not-nice things about his character. Then you find out that he suffers from CTE from a life of playing football. Ah well... okay we know more about CTE and how it impacts you, so maybe he's not a monster, but still, that's what you get for playing football. Ah then you found out he grew up in a very poor neighborhood with poor schooling, but genetically was predisposed to being quite large and this was a way for him to provide for himself and his family. Hmmm... okay maybe less of a monster. And we can go on and over and find that often, these people that we think are terrible or who are doing terrible things, are products (like we all are).\n\nThis view doesn't negate or ignore the need for consequences. The CTE example illustrates the difference. We  understand he might require intervention or restrictions, not necessarily out of blame, but out of necessity to protect both himself and others. Our responses might include things like treatment, restrictions, or reintegration programs. Additionally we should look at the situations that caused him to get there in the first place, like football protective gear, or the incentivization structure in and of itself – the point isn't to ignore bad acts, but to focus on solutions that go beyond simplistic retribution.\n\nThis view aligns with society's growing focus on empathy and understanding root causes of problems. However,  people struggle with applying it to extremists like Nazis or terrorists. I argue that it's most essential in these cases. Understanding complex circumstances leading to harmful ideologies helps us dismantle them without demonizing individuals. This isn't about excusing actions, but about more effective societal and rehabilitative responses that actually prevent future harm.\n\nLots of people I know find this view uncomfortable, and I want to understand why. It often feels like people agree with me on one level, but don't want to fully accept the implications. Thank you for reading this and please, feel free to change my view.",

  "selftext": "a long time ago, voting rights in the u.s. were very limited, often restricted to male landowners. this remained true until the jacksonian era when white males began to gain suffrage regardless of land ownership. coincidentally, this is also when most explicitly racial laws prohibiting blacks from voting originated. with limited exceptions, before then, anyone who wasn't a slave could have voted regardless of race, provided they met the same standards as other men. with almost no exceptions, women were always excluded until 1920.\n\nso, what do i want? well, i'm not sure. i appreciate some aspects of democracy, but i believe that universal suffrage has led to a lack of accountability for voters. when their chosen policies or politicians fail, individual voters who made poor choices suffer the same consequences as everyone else. they rarely change their political beliefs to compensate for their errors; instead, they often double down on their choices, displaying false confidence. i abhor racial laws, and while i am more tolerant of sexist laws, i generally think they are a bad idea too. i strongly believe that those who vote should have a stake in the outcome. voting should be limited to individual land ownership, which would exclude anyone who isn't the sole owner of a piece of land. this would include women and men of any genetic or cultural heritage.\n\nthis brings me to democracy in general. while i think that some level of democracy is beneficial, i believe that strict democracy has proven itself insufficient. our politicians, whom we elect, have no sense of ownership of our cities, states, or nation, which has led them to abuse the system, the land, and the people. like walmart stockboys, they couldn't care less about the customer or the long-term health of the company; they simply collect their paycheck and move on. this is in stark contrast to an entrepreneur of a sole proprietorship, who has everything invested. unlike the stockboy, the entrepreneur needs the business to succeed and will work long, hard hours to prevent failure. they persist into old age so they can pass it on to their children and prepare them for the responsibility, passing on their wisdom to ensure they are prepared to take over when the time comes.\n\nthe benefits of this model should be clear from that analogy, but there are downsides as well. choosing a successor based on heritage is foolish, even if it has its advantages. this is evident in how often businesses passed down to children fail miserably. perhaps there is a way to prevent this from happening, which is, i think, where voting plays a crucial role. what if we had a royal family where the next monarch wasn't appointed but elected from among that extended family and among the governors of the various states? i believe this could give landowners some input and still imbue leaders with a sense of ownership over the nation's well-being.\n\nfinally, the rulers need to be checked, regardless of how they are appointed to office, and the people need to be checked, regardless of how well they agree. no supermajority should be allowed to impose slavery, and no dictator should be allowed to limit speech. this brings us to the rule of law. there should be a constitution that legally grants people basic rights that no laws or regulations can contradict. such a constitution can be violated in practice but should at least provide people with some protection and might even develop into a moral standard.\n\nthe system i have described admittedly resembles pre-colonial british government, though with crucial differences.\n\nthe only things i am certain of are these:\n\n1. universal suffrage has failed us. \n2. the people we elect are never our best and brightest \n3. our politicians are, in a manner of speaking, lawless rapists—they gain power by deceit or force, abuse their power, and then move on with little to no consequence.",

People are given the work load of 1.5 people and its steadily getting worse. \n\nI get that things don't have to be \"fair\" but having everyone under 35 not be able to afford housing ever in their lives and people just shrugging their shoulders and saying \"Meh, what are ya gonna do, this is the new normal\" while simultaneously raising rent prices so high that landowners can sit on their ass and retire comfortably at 50 making passive income while wanting to raise the retirement age for workers to 100 is nothing short of comical.",

  "selftext": "Browsing reddit has made more aware of how prevalent misandry is, both online and in real life. Looking back I'm noticing it's always been there but it's never been called out and was largely presented as acceptable.

In the show 'The King of Queens\", Carrie is extremely misandrist and abusive to Doug, who is scared of his wife, and it's played as a funny thing.

  "selftext": "We all know that AI usage has exploded in the last few years. While there is an undercurrent of fear regarding the eventual sentience of AI, the more practical and current concern is how AI will eventually change the job market.\n\nCompanies are now laying off employees and replacing them with AI, like [Google firing 30,000 employees](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/google-plans-layoff-30000-employees-fight-between-ai-humans-nath-esj8c/). While some have speculated that AI won't take over the majority of jobs, only improving workflow, I find this thought to be naive.\n\nAI is not the printer press, the cotton gin, or the automobile. While those innovations did replace certain industries (the automobile made blacksmiths and ferriers unnecessary since everyone eventually stopped riding around in horse and buggy), they also created new industries that increased production within the overall job market.\n\nThis is not what AI does. AI does not simply make one or two industries obsolete; it has the potential to make the *majority* of human workers in most industries obsolete. It does not have the means to increase production beyond what it takes away from the job market.\n\nThis isn't simply, \"Oh you lost your job due to innovation? You should find new skills.\" Because beyond labor workers (construction, trade skills, military, etc.), *all* skills can eventually be done by AI and done better.\n\nAnd people are skeptical saying, \"Well, it can't write code write now.\" or \"The blogs it writes are terrible.\" or \"Did you see that AI art with the three arms?\" While that may be so, the exponential growth means that AI will eventually be good enough to replace the majority of white collar and creative jobs. It's already good enough to replicate writer and painter styles, sext with humans, and remove the majority of low skill computer jobs, like transcription.\n\nIt's not simply a new innovation. It will eventually be (and I presume very quickly) an entire restructuring of work. Why should companies pay actual humans that are falable when they can hire however many workers to run the AI and produce whatever the organization needs for exponentially cheaper?\n\nEventually, and I'm guessing within 15 years, AI will reshape the job market to the point where universal basic income will become a necessity for people to simply get money and survive.\n\nI'm hopeful that someone can change my view on this because I certainly don't want this to happen. I would like the majority of people to keep their jobs, but I currently don't see a future where one of three things don't happen:\n\n1. UBI is mandated.\n2. Laws are passed that require companies to have X% of human workers.\n3. A combination of the two.",

This is true because all people are capable of speaking down to others.  There's a whole host of reasons for one person to patronise another person. \n\nStating that there are specifically men-to-women scenarios alone doesn't make an argument for needing divisive terms.

  "selftext": "One incredibly concerning sentiment that I have seen on Reddit recently is “I know Biden is in serious mental decline, but I’m still voting for him anyway.”\n\nIt’s one thing to say in passing “I’d vote for a sack of potatoes before I would vote for Trump.” but it’s another thing entirely to let your fear of Trump drive you to vote for someone on death’s doorstep plus Kamala Harris.\n\nWhy is Kamala Harris so bad? Let’s talk about it.\n\n“Harris's record on wrongful conviction cases as attorney general has engendered criticism from academics and activists.[150] Law professor Lara Bazelon contends Harris \"weaponized technicalities to keep wrongfully convicted people behind bars rather than allow them new trials\".[150] After the 2011 United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Plata declared California's prisons so overcrowded they inflicted cruel and unusual punishment, Harris fought federal supervision, explaining \"I have a client, and I don't get to choose my client.\"[151]”\n\nHarris criticized Biden for his opposition to bus students to enforce desegregation during the 2020 primary debates and was criticized during the debate for blocking DNA testing for a death row inmate, her defense of California’s death penalty in 2014 as attorney general.\n\nBut then Biden took Harris on as his VP because his campaign wanted a diversity hire \n\n“During her time in office, Harris has had one of the lowest approval ratings of any vice president in recorded history.”\n\nI dunno about you but it takes skill to get the worst approval ratings for a vice president.\n\n“Harris's term in office has seen high staff turnovers that included the departures of her chief of staff, deputy chief of staff, press secretary, deputy press secretary, communications director, and chief speechwriter. An anonymous source said that they resigned because they and other staffers \"often feel mistreated\" by senior staffers.[340] \"Symone Sanders, senior advisor and chief spokesperson for Harris, pushed back against the complaints\" and defended their management style, especially for giving opportunities to black women.[340][341][342] Sanders herself resigned from her position in December 2021.[343]”\n\nWhen you listen to her speeches, she gives off a dumb blonde vibe and arguably has just as many if not more gaffes than Biden.\n\nI’ve had the theory that one of the reasons Harris was hired was a protection against impeachment for Biden. Because, if Biden is convicted by the Senate, then Harris will be president.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris",

  "selftext": "There are millions and millions and millions of people out there who have cancer, live in chronic pain, have been depressed or anxious for decades, or who have other issues that make life unbearable. Why do we force many of these people to suffer in pain versus giving them a humane way out of life?\n\nIf you have cancer, then they put you in Hospice, and they make you suffer and suffer and suffer until they give you the final dose. There is no death with dignity in this scenario. It’s the only model we have right now for people who are terminally ill.\n\nThe only option for people with severe anxiety or depression is just a bunch of pills that can make life even more unbearable from many. Sometimes there are treatment resistant problems. \n\nMany people live with chronic pain from something extremely serious, that is resistant to pain management, or any type of surgery, so is someone just supposed to lay around and scream and yell until they kill themselves? Doesn’t seem humane. \n\nSo right now I think we have about 7 to 12 states that allow death with dignity, but I hear it’s extremely difficult, but at least those states allow it. Switzerland and a few other countries allow it as well, but I know it can cost up to $50,000 or more, I’m not really sure. \n\nIf we had euthanasia clinics or death with dignity clinics in every state, and made death with dignity federally legal, then qualified people, could feel at rest and possibly be surrounded by their family and not carry around the stigma of suicide or have a painful death or have their family members be traumatized. \n\nWhy do we make it so difficult? Well one would think that the doctors are just so, so nice and they just really want to make sure that you can get cared for. Primarily this is bullshit. The reason they have hospice patients is because they can make a lot of money from hospice patients. Why do they have clinics for people who have depression and anxiety, because there’s a lot of money in pills. Why do we have opioids and surgeries that never even work? Because there’s a lot of money in surgery and pills. \n\nIf people have tried these things for a certain number of years, and they are done with life, why not help them out and give them that dignity?\n\nThere would be a cost associated with it, and obviously a screaming, so that the healthcare providers that would not be held responsible, but it shouldn’t cost so much money, and it shouldn’t take so much time.\n\nNo, this would not be for some young guy who’s lost his girlfriend or someone who’s even had a loss in the family, but for very extreme issues, like terminal illness, unresolved, depression, and anxiety or unrelenting pain. \n\nThanks, everyone for your answers, and I appreciate anyone to whom I issue Delta. It is a very controversial issue, and there are a lot of things I think of. Although I learned a lot of things regarding this euthanasia, and I agree with a lot of people on here, I still believe in euthanasia. But now I do understand some of the points that people made. It is impossible for me to get to all of these things, as I am brutally disabled. It is very hard for me to even type, so I’ve done the best that I could. Thanks.",

  "title": "CMV: Depression isn't \"real\" (in the way people think it is)",
  "selftext": "Okay, so there are a couple of common arguments that I hear when this topic is brought up, and for the sake of presenting the other side fairly, I'm going to try and steel-man them.\n\n1. Depression is a biologically real illness: There's a subset of people who, by virtue of some combination of genetics and environment, are unable to properly regulate their mood. We know that these people exist for a couple of reasons: we're able to scan their brains and find that there are significant differences in their brains, both in chemicals like neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine) and stress hormones, as well as changes in the structure itself, like grey matter and the like. We also can infer that these people are unique because, in more severe kinds of depression, they exhibit remarkable symptoms that go beyond a normal bout of sadness, like psychosis and psychomotor retardation (that's the name of the symptom, don't kill me). These symptoms imply that there's some kind of dysregulation going on with the chemicals in the brain because you typically wouldn't see those things in a normal person who's sad, even if they've experienced horrible a tragedy.  Furthermore, we can logically figure out that these people exist because they seem to come to therapists presenting with similar symptoms and respond to the same treatment --- so, even if we don't know the exact cause, and by extension, exactly why the treatment works, we can still identify that there's an illness.\n2. If depression isn't real, and it's some kind of choice that you're making, why does it provide no benefits? People generally don't like being depressed, so obviously it's something they can't control, because if they could control it, wouldn't they stop just stop? Since they can't \"just stop\", it doesn't take a genius to realize they probably can't control it. Furthermore, you don't get to just choose your mindset, your subconscious does, and your subconscious is ruled by the chemicals in your brain, so someone who exhibits such abnormal symptoms is probably experiencing some kind of syndrome or disease related to those chemicals.\n\nHopefully, I've argued these points satisfactorily - if not, take the post down or destroy me in the comments. I prefer the ladder, because I get to be proven wrong, and being wrong is generally bad so I'd like to eliminate the wrong ideas I have.\n\nNow here's my argument\n\n1. I don't think there's any compelling evidence that depression is biologically real in the sense that it is a disease acting on you, like diabetes or cancer, that can only be controlled or cured externally. The only thing that the brain scans tell us is that depressed people have different brains from non-depressed people --- we don't know why. As it turns out, Criminals tend to have higher levels of dopamine and smaller behavior-regulating parts of the brain. Does that mean criminality is a disease, and their actions aren't a choice? Now, I'm no doctor. I don't know to what level criminal minds differ from average, and I don't know if depression differs more. I also don't know if there's a level of difference from the average brain that would qualify you as \"having a disease\" However, it does seem to be the case that, because of neuroplasticity, your actions, thoughts, and experiences can cause chemical and structural differences in the brain. Now, the question is: can patterns of behavior change your brain to such an extent that depression does? We know a couple of things that can point to an answer, I think.\n2. Cognitive behavioral therapy has been associated with changes in brain structure and chemicals, including neurotransmitter receptors for dopamine and serotonin. Furthermore, and this is really important: chronic stress and negative experiences can lower serotonin levels. This raises the question: do low serotonin levels create negative thought patterns, or do negative thought patterns lower serotonin levels? I don't think there's an answer to that question in the current research, though I bet the answer is that they compound each other. So, is it possible that negative thought and behavioral patterns could cause symptoms as serious as severe depression? maybe.  But the beauty is, even if they can't cause depression, correcting negative thought and behavior patterns will definitively help, and we know that. (we haven't even gotten into vitamin deficiencies ex: a severe vitamin b12 deficiency can present exactly like schizophrenia)\n3. The real point is is that I doubt any of you know the answers to these questions unless I've missed something serious. Assuming I haven't, you can't make the argument that depression is definitively biologically real because we don't know that and we can't know that.\n\nThe rest is assuming everything I said above is true, and before I get into it, this has to be said:  If you're thinking of killing yourself, you should take antidepressants --- nobody can help you if you're dead\n\n1. Okay, so why would someone be depressed, assuming that it isn't just biological? Well, maybe you have a horrible life (no relationship, no job, don't care about college, etc. No friends.) If that's the case, and that's often the case, the solution shouldn't be just to diagnose you with depression and put you on antidepressants. That might help, but it's just allowing you to put off the real problem: your life is horrible and you should probably fix it. Furthermore, if there are obvious actionable solutions that will make your life better, and you're not taking them because they are hard (and believe me, they can be hard: I know that from experience. Obvious does not mean easy), then I don't think you ought to believe that you're depressed, because the only possible result of labeling yourself that way would be pathologizing the behavior (it's not my fault I don't have a girlfriend, it's that I'm depressed and I can't go out in public, and I'm a piece of shit and nobody loves me (but all that's just the depression and anxiety)). Maybe just accept that life is hard, and everyone's figuring out a way to deal with it. Find a goal --- something you know you can do (If you can't move you're so depressed, maybe the goal is as easy is wiggling a pinkie), and get the reward systems activated. You can only benefit from believing you aren't depressed in this situation.\n2. Now, if you're depressed and you have a good life, and you're still suffering, you can choose to believe that you're suffering from an illness. Maybe that helps you in the short term. But, now what? Well, you can take antidepressants for the rest of your life and hope they keep working. However, maybe, just maybe, depression isn't a real illness. Consider the possibility --- if depression isn't real, then there's something you're doing that's wrong, and you don't know what it is. It could be as simple as diet, but maybe not. Maybe you have some deep need that you haven't fulfilled. If you simply view depression as an illness that you have to manage, you'll never seek out that root cause, because the cause is just Biological.\n3. This is just an afterthought, but oftentimes, depressed thinking comes across as very self-centered. If you're always thinking about yourself, how you're worthless, etc. and you're always judging yourself for things nobody else cares about --- maybe ego problems could be one of the sources of depression. It's just a thought, but the only way to know for sure would be to stop believing depression is something intrinsic about yourself, and a symptom --- your subconscious telling you something's not right.\n\nThis goes without saying, but none of this is easy. Change isn't easy, and if your baseline is low, you're gonna have to change more than other people. Getting addicted to drugs is a result of choices, but that doesn't make it any easier to get out of it once you're there.",

Swipe apps just give you the chance to start off with that initial physical attraction, which can make things more exciting.\n\nIf you're into finding someone you're attracted to (and who’s also attracted to you) and want a convenient way to do it, swipe apps are the strongest option to date. Just remember to keep an open mind and look for more than just looks. It's about finding that where physical attraction meets real compatibility.\n\n\nEdit (Add In): \n\nI wanted to add that some people criticize dating apps are horrible and shallow and bad for society, but I believe that some of that criticism comes from a fear of rejection. Let's face it, putting yourself out there can be intimidating.\n\nWith dating apps, there's a certain level of vulnerability involved. You're opening yourself up to potential rejection with every swipe. And that can be scary. So, it's understandable that some folks might prefer to stick to more traditional methods of dating where the risk of rejection feels lower.\n\nBut here's the thing: rejection is a part of dating, no matter how you meet people. It's not exclusive to dating apps. Sure, you might face a few more rejections on apps because there are more options and people can be pickier. But that doesn't mean it's a reason to write off the whole idea.\n\nIn fact, dating apps can actually help you develop thicker skin when it comes to rejection. You'll realize that not everyone is going to be interested, and that's okay. It's a learning experience that can build your resilience and help you grow.",

  "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that, of course, a certain base level of intrinsic motivation is always required for learning and mental development. \n\nHowever, I see that while in (Western) education there is a general consensus that, while individual student’s intrinsic motivation and openness to learning is crucial, partially it is also the responsibility of the educational establishment and educators to keep students motivated on their journey. I am not talking about gamifying everything - but about improving the material, improving teacher-student interactions, helping establish student (study-related) communities, trying to make learning - no, not a 24/7 fun ride, of course - but pleasant and rewarding, etc. This can be done in various ways depending on the type of establishment. \n\nWith therapy, however, it seems like the expectation is that the client should come motivated to change. If they are not, then the therapist can just shrug and say “well… they were not ready! What a bummer! Tough luck indeed”. But that is insane. While keeping yourself motivated and interested in academic materials can be difficult, keeping yourself motivated to work on your mentality is even more difficult. It is very normal that a client does not feel intrinsically motivated to do that. Of course a therapist is never fully responsible for their client’s motivation, and it is impossible to ensure every client stays motivated (and that is very normal, no teacher has a 100% success rate either), but it sure as hell must be their job to help the client stay motivated, find out what motivates their brain to be more receptive to the techniques they are applying, helping to make sessions feel rewarding, etc. It is insane that one professional that directly works with one’s psyche can just sit back and exhume a deep thought(tm) that some people are not motivated to change. No shit Sherlock! You should be motivating them! That must be part of your job!",

  "selftext": "As much as I could post something regarding Valentine's day, given that it's one of my most hated days of the year, I think I'm going to try to be a little more general and productive this time around by trying to express and maybe even dispel this admittedly long-entrenched view that has been in my mind ever since I realized how utterly and pathetically behind I was most of my peers. So I'll be 25 in 2 months, and sufficed to say, even without my generalized anxiety disorder, I feel like this anxiety of what the future holds has been creeping up on me because I was never able to collect the \"pieces of the puzzle\" needed to build a good life before I cross the point of no return, that being the age of 25. To elaborate on why I believe the \"good life\" ends after 25, here's some reasons listed in no particular order. Although this seems to be a very \"American\" view of things, I would once again like to clarify that I live in Toronto, Canada (which tbh is the most American city you can get in Canada)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Dating/finding love/getting married becomes practically impossible (though in my case, it was probably impossible from the very beginning due to my ASD) outside of dating apps, which are pretty much useless for most people seeking true love anyways\n2. People become truly solidified in their cliques/\"busyness\" (though again, in my case, it seems to be that way even when I entered university)\n3. No real chances for \"repeated, unplanned proximity\" that \"experts\" preach about, even with organizations/clubs/hobby groups given that people show up sporadically \n4. You become a slave to work/responsibilities unless you own a business/are a CEO that makes others lives miserable\n5. Your body starts to break down\n\nIt seems like the only people who won't suffer this fate are those who were able to find their people (both platonic and romantic) and their niche well before turning 25, though the body breaking down is admittedly more of a unanimous thing. \n\nStill, doesn't change the underlying feeling of being a total disgrace that has been suffocating me mentally for the past 8 years of my life, even after 9.5 years of therapy with 12 different therapists. \n\nRegardless, I am interested to hear some perspectives. Who knows, maybe I'll actually start looking forward to the future rather than dreading it. ",

  "title": "CMV: DNA is akin to a \"soul\", and therefore, having kids is the only way for that soul to survive for the majority of people",
  "selftext": " My CMV is as follows- \n\n* DNA is akin to common religious interpretations of a \"soul\".\n* Having biological children is the only way for your \"soul\" to continue to exist, for the vast majority of the population. \n\nThe definition of a \"soul\", according to most religions, is some ethereal entity outside of your physical body, which is a part of your body, **continues to exist after your death**, and encapsulates your **identity**, **personality**, and **memories**.\n\nWe have no scientific evidence for the existence of spiritual entities in general, let alone human souls. However, DNA in many ways represents most of the same attributes we would assign to human souls.\n\n**Continues to exist after death**\\-\n\nUnless your ancestors were famous or influential in some disproportionate way, its likely that whoever your ancestors were thousands of years ago has been completely forgotten. The only remnant of them today is their descendants (you), and the small amount of their DNA that you now carry as part of your own DNA. \n\n**Personality**\\-\n\n33% of human DNA governs brain development and function, the highest proportion of gene expression in any part of the body. This is a contributing factor to 30-60% of human personality being attributable to genetics-\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0263-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-018-0263-6)\n\nIn this way, a small amount of the personality of your ancestors continues to propagate in your conscious and subconscious minds.   \n\n**Identity**\\-\n\nObviously, you physical appearance is predominantly governed by your genetics, and you will carry at least some small part of your ancestors physical appearance i.e. eye color, hair color, race, etc. \n\n**Memories-** \n\nYou don't need to train a border collie to herd, it is an instinct encoded in their DNA. Likewise, humans have many instincts, i.e. infants instinctively hold their breath underwater, some humans have a natural fear of spiders and snakes, etc. Important aspects of our personalities i.e. our desire to congregate, collaborate, and invent, are likewise traits given to us by our DNA. \n\nSo DNA encapsulates many of the concepts we would normally attribute to a human \"soul\", and is perhaps the only equivalent we have (assuming there is no God, or that there is a God, but one that does not care about our continued ethereal existence after death). \n\nHowever, this \"soul\" is biological, and can die with us. If you do not propagate your DNA through having children, and you do not have some major impact on the world in other ways, then **any evidence of your existence will wash away over time, and it'll be as if you never existed in this universe.** \n\nCounter arguments I can foresee- \n\n1. It is possible to leave a lasting impact on humanity outside of having kids- Yes, but this is unachievable for the majority of the population. Most people will not make scientific discoveries like Einstein, invent the wheel, found fortune 500 companies, etc. 99% of the population is destined to be born, eat, maintain the status quo via some 9 to 5, procreate, and then die. Their contribution to whatever corporation they worked for does not imbue a lasting aspect of their personality or essence on the universe. 10,000 years from now, will anyone remember all the accountants at some random company? Unlikely. \n2. Humanity is doomed in the long term anyway, and we will all collectively be forgotten after we die out, so its not really impossible to transcend death long term- Probably, but the existential problems humans face in the long run (interstellar travel, the heat death of the universe, etc.) are problems that our descendants will be the ones tackling, not us. This is a slippery slope argument that could likewise be used to argue against all human progress i.e. not addressing climate change. ",

  "selftext": "On reddit, and online especially I often see people make the claim that 'Loli hentai' (Drawn porn featuring child characters) ought to be banned online. To many this seems like an attractive position, after all child porn is disgusting, is it not? Yet most of the time someone points out that Loli Hentai is not actually real porn, no person or child was harmed in its making, and thus it isn't the same as supporting child porn, which causes actual harm to children. Typically, after this point a opponent of Loli argues that even if no child is harmed in loli it is still bad because it contributes to the sexualizing of children, which can lead to further harm.\n\nThat last argument leads me to this post, in a generalized form it states that even if consuming something doesn't create harm in and of itself (i.e. directly supporting child rape) it can still be immoral or deserving of being banned if it promotes things that actually cause harm. If this is the argument then this equally applies to almost all porn.  Take for example consensual non-consent. No one is harmed in the making of it, yet according to the logic of this argument it ought to be banned because it normalizes and promotes rape. Additionally this argument should support banning porn entirely, as many many many studies have shown how porn consumption contributes to the development of negative views regarding women. Even if the porn was produced ethically, according to this logic the narratives it creates about women still make it immoral. So if someone opposes Loli content on these grounds they should admit to opposing all porn entirely.   \n\n\nAnd just a disclaimer. I do not enjoy or watch Loli content. I don't believe it is morally wrong, but it isn't up my alley.

  "selftext": "The US, and NATO in general, have not played particularly fair in regards to Russia. I am only stating the facts I am aware of, as best I know them -- I would love to learn more that makes me rationalize the US/NATO's position. \r  \n\r  \nFor starters -- a large majority of individuals in Crimea (almost 75%) want to be part of Russia. A majority of those in the Donbas want to be Russian as well. This is not true of Western Ukraine -- who pretty much unilaterally wants to remain a sovereign nation (about 95% i think). Russia taking claim to these areas, which largely would prefer to be under Russian control, doesn't seem like an issue we should be involved in.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the dissolve of the USSR, there was largely an expectation that Russia and the west could productively exist, and that the west would be more proactive in opening their arms to Russia. The West hasn't been particularly interested in this thus far, and far as I can tell, hasn't operated in particularly good faith.\r  \n\r  \nNATO always agreed they would not move further East towards Russia. Nato has reneged on that promise several times. In 1999 Nato added Czechia, Poland and Hungary. In 2004, NATO added Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. In 2009, NATO added Albania and Croatia. In 2017 they added Montenegro, in 2020 NATO added Macedonia, and in 2023 NATO added Finland and Norway.\r  \n\r  \nRussia has a legitimate reason to be weary of the democracies of the West. After all -- Hitler came to power legally under a Democratic Constitution. The cold war also went on for 44 years, and didn't end until 1991. Russia has a reason to be skeptical of the west.\r  \n\r  \nNATO has developed and deployed a massive missile arsenal surrounding the western and southwestern border of Russia. Though the proposed reasoning for developing said missile system was to defend against Iran, a basic map of the locations of said missiles makes this statement questionable. Furthermore, Russia initially requested to be part of the development of said missile defense system, and NATO rejected them.\r  \n\r  \nThe US is already facing an absolutely insurmountable national debt. We have many crises we are facing at home. The debt we accrued fighting wars that weren't ours to fight in the middle east still hasn't been paid. We have had 20 years to see how the \"war on terror,\" turned out. The resulting loss of life, the expense, and the absolutely abysmal withdrawal. Why are we getting involved in another conflict?\r  \n\r  \nThe current regime in Ukraine was largely influenced by the west. The US sunk nearly $5 billion into democracy education in Ukraine between 1991 and 2014. When the Ukrainian government was overthrown there in 2014, it was a move that was largely supported, and even funded, by the West. This new government was far less Russia friendly than the government of the past. Russia, somewhat rightfully, saw this as further action by the west to alienate them.\r  \n\r  \nWhy have we spent $75 billion protecting another countries borders when we fail to protect our own? A wall at the southern border would cost +/- $20 billion. We have spent almost 4 times that in Ukraine already. FWIW, I am firmly pro immigration. But I am pro legal immigration. Far too many criminals are being let in unvetted, and the southern border is allowing massive amounts of fentanyl into the country.\r  \n\r  \nI'm sure there is situation is far more nuanced that what I've outlined above. And furthermore, I am well aware that Putin is a terrible human. From murdering his political opponents, to his treatment of marginalized groups, Putin is nobody I am trying to shower with praise in any way shape or form. That being said, I do think Russia has been somewhat provoked to take the steps they have. Furthermore, I am not in favor of sending American dollars, and certainly not in favor of sending american boys/men, to die on the front lines of Ukraine. And finally -- Putin's approval rating in Russia is nearly 80% -- meaning his people must generally support the direction he's taken their country. \r  \n\r  \nOnce again -- I am no supporter of the regime in Russia -- it is essentially a dictatorship at this point. Politically, I am about as libertarian as it gets. But as far as I can tell -- the US and Nato have in may ways been throwing shit at Russia since the USSR dissolved. ",

When I moved to Seattle during the COVID, I bought a house and invited my coworkers over for dinner. they all said thanks and said they would invite me the next time. it's been 3 years and since then I moved to a different job, and I never hear from them.\r  \n\r  \n4. I used to organize group activities for my previous team at my new job. creating a group chat, organizing dinners and such. It turns out I was the only one. nobody else bothered to reciprocate or made an active effort to organize group activites for others.\r  \n\r  \n5. I have a habit of saying hi to other people in the office and or striking up random conversations with strangers. it turns out vast majority of them don't reciprocate.\r  \n\r  \nSo I conclude that the vast majortiy of people are inherently selfish and only care about their self interests and not capable of showing kindness to the others, so therefore not worthy of my kindness.\r  \n\r  \nI will still help those that are disadvantaged, such as the homeless, disabled, and those that are in the nursing homes, but for the ordinary people who don't have to struggle to meet their basic needs, I realized that they are inherently selfish for some reason whether we were preprogrammed by evolution or by our alien creators to be this way I will never know but one thing I know from here on out is that I will never show kindness to other ordinary people that have their basic needs met.",

  "selftext": "It seems only obvious who are the antagonists if you look at history post-WW2. Practically almost ALL the Cold War conflicts were started due to communist vs democracy ideals, the former largely fuelled and supported by the Soviet Union back then. Now imagine if you removed communism from the equation.\n\n* No Korean War and North Korea.\n* No Vietnam War and prob a much more developed Vietnam today.\n* No dictatorships in half of Europe (eastern bloc) and millions suffering under oppressive regimes.\n* No East/West Germany, no Berlin wall.\n* No Chenchya conflict, no Yugoslavia conflict, and no civil conflicts in a whole bunch of other East European countries I cant be bothered to list and name...\n* No Cuban missile crisis.\n* No Iran nuclear crisis.\n* No Soviet Afghanistan invasion, resulting in no Al Qaeda, resulting in no 9/11, resulting in Americans never intervening in the Middle East to begin with and making USA the number one hated country among Arabs.\n* And also a ton of civil wars propping all over Asia betw. communist rebels and governments wouldn't have occured.\n\nNow of course, all this is assuming the Soviets collapsed after WW2 for various reasons. This one is rather unclear but I'll just play out scenarios like the Allies just letting the Nazis and Soviets battle it out till the Soviets lost and then the Allies fought and defeated the Nazis from there. Either way, the presumption holds there was no longer any communist Soviet influence following WW2 due to the collapse of the hegemony.\n\nOnly geopolitical issue I could see still remaining would be China-US since China's communism was largely independent from the Soviets and there was also the Soviet-Sino split. But regardless China wouldn't have another massive ally on their side today if Russia was never communist. The country was also more isolationist back then and unlikely to have had the same scale of influence to instigate communist uprisings worldwide\n\nNow I know some of you are gonna make the argument saying Russia was a major contributor to winning the war against the Nazis but if you think about it... could the Allies *still have won* without the Russians? What we do know is the Russians back then were already inevitably fighting the Nazis after Op. Barborossa so either way, they would have vastly weakened the Nazis for the Allies. Also the Americans finally made the atom bomb.\n\nEnd of the day, we gotta ask... was the victory of WW2 really a victory...? Or just a precursor to even an even more disastrous time for the world? Were the Nazis really the bad guys or the Russians all this time? People also tend to overlook the massive war atrocities committed by the Russians during WW2 against the Germans (yes, the Americans did bad stuff too but not on the same scale as Russians. Near the end of the war, Germans in Berlin would rather flee to the Americans instead)",

  "selftext": "The story about, of course, Brent Kavanaugh assaulting her at a party when they were young. The whole debacle reminds me of Smollett's story because of how weird the claims are, and I want someone to explain what I'm missing here that makes it plausible.\n\nIn short, nothing about her allegation makes sense to me if she were telling the truth, but it makes total sense if she made it up. I don't find her accusation to be \"credible\", a word I keep running into when looking her up, because my definition of \"credible\" involves proof beyond someone's say-so.\n\nThe ideal made-up story is unfalsifiable. There can be no crucial details that can be debunked and prove part of the story couldn't have happened. That's what makes me disbelieve Ford's accusation; no part of it is falsifiable, and every time an aspect of her story was disproven, she changed her story.\n\nShe doesn't know where it happened and she doesn't know exactly when it happened. She claims it happened at a house party with friends from her high school, but she claims to not remember where it was or even whose house it was. And none of her friends who have commented on her accusation remember any such party. Thing is, this should be *really* easy to figure out. The house must have belonged to someone in her high school or a friend of one of her friends, so all she'd have to do is pull out a yearbook and email whoever she could find with any details about the house she does remember. Like, \"whose house had the green carpet in the living room and all the paintings of birds on the walls?\" *Someone* would remember exactly what house that was. Finding out where the assault took place would be crucial for any investigation into the assault. So why hadn't she tried to locate it?\n\nIf her accusation were true, and she hoped this accusation would bring justice against a sexual predator, there's no reason for her to avoid locating the house when it would be so simple to do. But if her accusation were a lie, this is *exactly* what she would do.\n\nIf she were lying, and she claimed the assault happened at a house that she remembered one of her high school friends living in, that would introduce a falsifiable detail. If it turned out, for example, that her friend didn't live in that house at the time Ford claimed the assault happened, her whole story falls apart. She would have to pile on more lies to explain why she believed the assault happened in a different house than she remembered.\n\nOf course, she did give *some* details about the house, and she's backtracked on almost all of them. She initially claimed the house was near a country club, but retracted that when it turned out none of the relevant parties had a house in that area. She also described a floor plan of the house, but backtracked on that as well after investigators couldn't find *any* house with her description.\n\nShe also gave an initial timeframe of the alleged assault, claiming it happened in the \"mid 1980's\", but after it was revealed Kavanaugh was in Yale since 1983, she revised her claim to the summer of 1982. Yet another detail that was re-remembered such that Kavanaugh remained the suspect.\n\nMost bizarrely of all, to me anyway, is that she can't remember how she got to the party or how she got home afterwards. It's unlikely she walked, because if she had, it would mean she was so familiar with the area that she could navigate back to her home on foot, which would therefore make it a little incredible that she can't recall where the house was. So she must have been driven. But if she named a driver, or said she called a cab, that's a falsifiable detail. If she claimed a friend drove her, and that friend didn't remember ever driving a distraught girl with bruises from a party, that would look pretty bad for her case. If she called a cab, that's information that can be located by the authorities. Taxi companies may still have records from 1982, and if it turned out there were no calls to or from any of her acquaintances' houses that year, that would also suggest she was lying.\n\nLet's assume Ford was assaulted and truly believes her story. The *only* detail she's claimed to be 100% certain of is that Kavanaugh assaulted her. This, to me, seems pretty absurd. When every other critical detail about the event has been false initially or conspicuously absent from her memory, it's clearly possible she's also misremembering the identity of the person who assaulted her.\n\nMy view is that she's lying. Someone who believes what they are saying wouldn't do their best to keep details too vague to investigate. They wouldn't change their story multiple times to ensure a particular person remains the suspect. I think her motivation was political, and intended to keep a conservative judge out of the SCOTUS. She happened to know him in high school, and used that connection to make a plausible-enough accusation against him in the hopes it would damage his political career. I do believe some people are craven enough to make their life a circus to take down someone they dislike. Reality TV is proof that there's a lot of people out there willing to do degrading things for 15 minutes of fame, and I think Ford is one of them.\n\nI want to know: what is so convincing about her story that makes people believe her? What part of her allegation is credible? I want my view challenged here.",

  "title": "CMV: In relation to white women, black men don’t benefit from anything that would be considered “male privilege”",
  "selftext": "I’ve been pondering this topic for a while now, especially after coming across several opinions online that made me question the common perceptions of “male privilege” and how it applies to black men versus white women. It’s a complex issue, and I think it’s worth dissecting a bit, especially with real-life experiences and some statistics to back it up. Let’s dive in.\n\nPrivilege and Perception\n\n1a. Male Privilege: A common understanding is that men, by default, have certain advantages, like being promoted/hired without their capabilities being attributed to anything other than merit, and having their professional opinions taken more seriously.\n\n1b. The Reality for Black Men: If a black man like myself gets promoted, there’s an immediate whisper campaign about affirmative action being the real reason, not my qualifications or hard work. And seriously, if you think black men are uniformly taken seriously in the workplace, I’ve got a bridge to sell you.\n\nAssault and Safety\n\n2a. Safety Concerns: A facet of male privilege is not having to worry about being sexually assaulted at the same rates as women.\n\n2b. A Harsher Reality for Black Men: What isn’t often discussed is that black men are significantly more likely to be victims of physical assault or hate crimes. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a daily concern that overshadows the supposed “privilege” of simply being male.\n\nRepresentation and Isolation\n\n3a. Being the Only One: It’s rare for men to be the only man in a professional setting, which is highlighted as a sign of male privilege.\n\n3b. The Loneliness of Being the Only Black Man: I can tell you firsthand, being the only black man in a room full of white people is not just lonely; it’s downright alienating. At one point, among approximately 1500 management-level employees across 500 locations in my former company, I was the sole black man. Imagine being the only one in meetings with hundreds of managers. That’s not privilege; it’s isolation. (Yes, there was a meaningful % white female managers)\n\nTrust and Emergencies\n\n4a. Emergencies and Trust: Men are often not questioned about their reliability or intentions in emergencies in the way women are.\n\n4b. Doubt and Discrimination: As a black man, any emergency I’m involved in comes with a default suspicion. Jail, dishonesty, you name it - I’ve been accused of it all without cause. This isn’t just hurtful; it contradicts the very notion of male privilege in my context.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe concept of “male privilege” is not one-size-fits-all. For black men, any perceived advantage is often undercut by the realities of racial discrimination and stereotypes. It’s essential to consider intersectionality and the ways in which race and gender interact to complicate the picture of privilege\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1. Assault and Victimization Rates: Between 2017-2021, violent crime rates were somewhat similar across races, but black individuals faced higher rates of robbery and aggravated assault compared to white individuals, highlighting the disproportionate risks for black men. Data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) indicates a nuanced difference in victimization rates by race, challenging the universal notion of male privilege (BJS, 2021) .\n\n2. Violent Victimization Increase: The BJS reported an increase in violent victimization from 16.5 per 1,000 persons in 2021 to 23.5 per 1,000 in 2022, underlining a growing concern for safety across all demographics, potentially impacting black men more severely (BJS, 2022) .\n\n3. Diversity in the Workplace: In my former company, a successful initiative to diversify our management team and employee base significantly increased the representation of women, particularly in management roles and as bookkeepers, with over 15% of managers being female. However, during my tenure, I was the second ever black member of management, and with the retirement of the first, only two black individuals remained in management, including myself as the only dark-skinned person. This contrasted sharply with the support structures in place, such as a support group for female employees, highlighting a significant gap in the company’s diversity and inclusion efforts for racial minorities.\n\n4. Hate Crimes Against Black, Jewish, and Homosexual Men: According to the FBI's 2022 hate crime statistics, the highest numbers of hate crimes were committed against Black individuals, Jewish communities, and homosexual men, making these groups the most targeted for bias-motivated offenses. \n\n2019 to 2022 Comparison:\nAnti-Black: saw an increase from 27.94% in 2019 to 29.4% in 2022, marking a 1.46 percentage point rise.\nAnti-Jewish: decreased from 12.10% in 2019 to 9.6% in 2022, a reduction of 2.5 percentage points.\nAnti-gay (male): experienced a decrease from 10.32% in 2019 to 9.2% in 2022, lowering by 1.12 percentage points.\n\nThis data highlights that these three groups are the primary victims of hate crimes, with no other group experiencing a higher rate of targeted hate crimes than gay men. The slight increase in hate crimes against Black individuals from 2019 to 2022 contrasts with the decreases seen in hate crimes against Jewish individuals and gay men, reflecting changes in the landscape of bias-motivated offenses over the years.\n\nEdit: to clarify, anybody saying im playing oppression Olympics I would like to clarify. I actually don’t give a shit about privilege. I live my life and do what I can. My problem is that white people keep assigning privilege to me. I don’t feel like white women or feminists are my allies because it doesn’t feel that way. They deny my struggle and act like I have privileges that I don’t identify with. They act as if my life is easier than there’s. So to be 100% clear my “obsession with the oppression Olympics” or the “idea of privilege” is reactionary. I care because THEY care. \n\nEdit: Murder is only a reasonable fear for black & Hispanic men. 1/20 black men dies from murder, that’s over twice as likely the next highest demographic which is Native/Hispanic men at 1/50 a piece\n\nEdit: PLEASE READ\n\nBLACK MEN GOT THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN 1965\n\nTHE 3/5ths COMPROMISE WAS NOT ACTUALLY ACKNOWLEDGING BLACK MEN AS HUMANS IT WAS ABOUT CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATION\n\nPLEASE UNDERSTAND HOW RIDICULOUS YOU SOUND WHEN YOU SAY WHITE WOMEN HAD LESS RIGHTS THAN LITERAL SLAVES ",

  "selftext": "People who otherwise lament whatever semblance of power copyright holders have over the Internet celebrate when overzealous companies use it crack down on R34 of cartoon characters, supposedly because \"what if a kid sees that\"? (I also notice this attitude is more popular in the context of girls' cartoons than boys' cartoons, but I'm not sure whether that's relevant or not.)\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nPeople condemn YouTube for showing sexually explicit ads, because \"what if a kid sees that\"? Meanwhile, countries that know what they're doing, like Sweden, prohibit advertising aimed at kids at all.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBut who gets to say what's appropriate for kids? There is no way around how subjective it is. American versions of foreign shows often censor homosexuality, even at the most mild level (affection, flirting, etc.) to cater to parents who don't want their kids exposed to it. You could argue they could censor it \"just in case,\" but other parents may believe just as strongly that kids should be exposed to its existence early and that it'd be wrong *not* to do so. Even if you think there's one \"objectively right\" answer to that issue, what about distinct subjects? What about cartoons that present innocuous homages to the most squeaky-clean of rap tracks, and parents who think that anything that could make a child curious about hip-hop is a slippery slope to discovering Eminem or Dr. Dre lyrics?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nIn radio and television, the answer is obvious. Parents who want their kids exposed to hip-hop but not homosexuality have one channel for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to homosexuality but not hip-hop have another for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to both have another for them. Parents who want their kids exposed to neither have another for them. The list goes on and on, for every distinct opinion one could have about what's appropriate for kids.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWith the Internet, the whole world shares one medium. So even if you were to censor the Internet to cater to parents' ideas of appropriacy for children, you can't please *everyone*.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnd in the name of this unfeasible goal, people would be throwing away a unique opportunity to have the medium unusually free from corporate power double as the medium unusually free from \"think of the children\" self-censorship. And in light of the introductory example, arguably undermine the former role of the Internet anyway.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nAnd once you achieve that, what's stopping hackers from introducing stuff that violates whatever standard a plurality of parents agreed to? What if they're from some geopolitically hostile country that refuses to prosecute them for hacking? Again, the whole world is sharing one medium here.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nTo me, that the Internet is hopelessly inappropriate for children and they should be kept away from it is an irreplaceable part of the solution. I don't know how; co-ordinating with other parents on a societal scale might be part of it; but I know the alternative can't be to self-censor and in so doing enable parents in continuing to let their kids use the Internet. This would just end in more parents letting more kids wade through more of the Internet more often, putting them at risk of being targeted by hackers and scammers and cult leaders and predators far more nefarious than the occasional R34 artist or inappropriate ad director ever was.\r",

It's impossible to conceive a world where a rehabilitation focused criminal justice system would be viable politically even in cases where poverty is dealt with properly. \n\n\nEdit: the Nordic justice system is impossible in countries without high social cohesion.

  "title": "CMV: Within at least a couple of centuries, most popular culture from the last 100 years will be largely forgotten by the general public.",
  "selftext": "Mass media is still kind of new. Television for example has only been a major form of entertainment for about 70 years. Movies as we know them today are only around 100 years old. As such most people are still aware of \"old\" movies, T.V. shows and other pop culture. I can reference stuff like Citizen Cain or I Love Lucy and people would still know what I'm talking about. Yet I feel that's simply because we're so early into the age of those mediums. I find it easy to imagine by the end of the millennium or even much sooner. most of this stuff will be completely forgotten.\n\nTo prove this I'll take a look at literature. Ya the format of how stories where written has changed a bit. But I think it's fair to say written works of fiction and stuff we'd today call novels have been around since the invention of writing. So it's an easy way to compare television and film to a much more ancient medium.\n\nI'll list all the novels, novellas, short stories, and epics that I can think of that are still well known and widely read today both for common education and recreation. I'll also take into account if the characters in the stories are well known staples of popular culture like Sherlock Holms or Count Dracula.\n\nIt's hard to say what great works of literature from the 21st century that will be considered highly remembered at least for a little while. Besides Harry Potter much to the dismay of J.K. haters. I also think the Hunger games has a decent chance at being considered a piece of classic literature.\n\nBut the 20th century is filled to the brim with stories that are not only known by the general public. but still widely read and referenced in popular culture here are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head.\n\nA Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, All Quiet on the Western Front, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James and the Giant Peach, Basically any Dr. Sues book, Charlotte's Web, Nineteen Eighty-Four, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm, The Jungle, Of Mice and Men, The Grapes of Wrath, Gone with the Wind, The Great Gatsby, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Catcher in the Rye, Lord of the Flies, Ulysses, The Most Dangerous Game, Stranger in a Strange Land, The Man In the High Castle (I'm not actually sure how well this book did on its own, But its amazon series was pretty popular) and The Shining.\n\nThe 19th century is similarly prolific. with a countless number of tales still known today which include but aren't limited to the following.\n\nHansel and Gretel, Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, The Tell-Tale Heart, The Raven, Dracula, basically any Sherlock Holmes book, Around the World in Eighty Days, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas, Journey to the Center of the Earth, From the Earth to the Moon, Oliver Twist, A Christmas Carol, A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations,\n\n(It just occurred to me how influential Dickens and Verne were. Besides the fact they both individually have more of their works listed on here than any other writer so far. One was partially responsible for reviving the popularity of an entire holiday. And the other helped popularize an entirely new genre of fiction. pretty cool. Moving on)\n\nHuckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, Uncle Tom's Cabin, Moby-Dick, Rip Van Winkle, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, War and Peace (Charlie Brown Loves this one!), The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, Frankenstein, Pride and Prejudice, The Last of the Mohicans, Jane Eyre, The Three Musketeers, and Les Misérables\n\nBut then we reach the early modern period. A time spanning 300 years from the beginning of the 16th century to the end of the 18th. Despite being longer than the 18 and 1900s combined. I can personally name less books that I feel are still popular in the present day. There is Robinson Crusoe, Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and Puss in Boots (I'm not sure what story he originated from but I'm pretty sure the character emerged around this time.)\n\nThat's a total of 7 stories over a 300 year timespan. almost half of which are from William Shakespeare who is a special case given he is arguably one of the most influential writers in history. so it's really only 4.\n\ngoing back further to the middle ages. A time period spanning around 1000 years of history. Here are the ones I can think of. the Divine Comedy, Robin Hood, King Arthur, The Canterbury Tales, the Pied Piper (Charlie Brown loves this one as well!), and a few other folktales and national epics that I know exist but can't name.\n\nThat's it. 1000 years of history filled to the brim with books largely forgotten. Things get worse when you get to classical and ancient history. Besides a few titles such as the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Epic of Gilgamesh there aren't really any stories from that time that are still known today.\n\nSo that's my point. The vast majority of the books known today are from the last 200 years. much of the rest of it has been forgotten with time. It's because of this I feel art isn't really timeless. we tend to get bored with the stuff we have and discard it with new crap forgetting our heritage.\n\nI know some of you will argue that the rise in the recent amount of books is simply because more are being published. As technology advances the amount of content being produced rises as well. Which is an understandable take, but still proves my point. Humans have been on this earth for around 200,000 years. I believe a species usually lasts around 1 to 10 million years before going extinct. meaning humans will likely be around for a very long time. And given the amount of content being produced nowadays. means our culture will soon be oversaturated with an exponentially rising amount of content most of which we will forget.\n\nIt's because of this I imagine that in 1000 years or even much sooner, most tv shows, music, video games, movies, and books from our age will be cast at the wayside. While I imagine some stuff, like The Godfather or The Twilight Zone will stand the test of time due to their massive influence on human culture. Most other stuff will not.\n\nI guess I'll close this off with one last literary analogy. Orwell predicted a world where books were banned, Huxley imagined one where we lost our passion for books, Bradbury believed we'd come to fear books. But in reality, mankind's dystopia will be a world where there are so many books that we simply can't appreciate them all.\n\nOr Maybe I'm just a pretentious piece of crap who underestimates humanity's ability to preserve its heritage. Idk, I'd love to here some counter arguments.\n\nEdit- My view has been partially changed. I think stuff might be forgotten by the general public. But large sums of people will still be interested in old pop culture. and given the world will be so interconnected in the future their will still be large community's centered around it.\n\nedit 2- It's also been pointed out to me that my assertion that what we today would call novels have always been around his a contentious topic amongst Literary historians. And many of the pre 19th century books I mentioned weren't books but epics, folk tales, etc. Which are interconnected with books but themselves not books. So maybe literature as we know it today isn't as ancient as I initially thought.",

We had sex and it was amazing. Then she told me she wanted to the friends. I accepted this but for months afterwards I would privately jerk off to her instagram.

These individuals have a financial benefit from you being attracted to them, so it’s fine to fantasize about them. If anything, this helps them make more money. \n\nOther celebrities are a gray area.

An absolutely open border would allow everyone and everything to legally pass: immigrants, criminals, drugs, weapons, nuclear material. No country as far as I know has completely open borders.\n\nProbably no one who talks about open or closed borders means either of these things. But what point between do they mean? Does a closed border mean no immigration at all? Does it mean no temporary foreign visitors as well? Is an open border any border that's not closed, for whatever that means, or does an open border mean anyone and everyone from any country can legally immigrate?\n\nWithout a clear definition, everyone who advocates for \"closed borders\" can appear to agree, but if one of them actually implemented their plans, another one might be frustrated by the excessive restrictions. We saw things like that happen with Brexit. Without a clear definition of open borders, someone can factually accuse a politician of supporting open borders and trigger a lot of outrage, when actually the politician's policies might be only mildly controversial proposals like slightly expanding the volume of legal immigration.\n\nIt should be fairly easy to change my view.

Money is printed (stimulus) and restricted (interest rates/taxes) as needed to keep inflation low.  A billionaire giving away a million to 1000 families will improve their QOL, but won’t make a difference at all for the grand scheme of things.  We have 330M people in the USA, 1000 families is a drop in the bucket.\n\nAlso, throwing cash around to people who will spend it will directly drive inflation if it’s done in a large enough quantity to make any difference.  Give all 330M Americans 1M dollars and the economy would fall apart completely.  People would quit lower paying jobs, now we don’t have those good being produced anymore and demand is high, so prices skyrocket.  Yea we could increase wages a little bit, but honestly if you take any major company and divide CEO wages by number of employees it turns to pennies per person.  Hell, divide net income by total employees and 2080 (full time annual hours) and you usually get just a few dollars an hour per person.  That’s the max they could do if they weren’t making anything at all.\n\nBillionaires having massive funds and not spending them is no different than the government not printing extra money to throw in the streets.  It’s just numbers on banks’ ledgers.\n\nThe jealousy and anger is unreal, and doesn’t do anything productive.  A wealth tax just moves numbers around, it doesn’t increase productivity or increase supply of goods, which ultimately control prices.  The government can print a trillion if they want with no damage done to our currency.  Taking more from billionaires that aren’t spending isn’t an inflation proof way to raise money.  Inflation happens when that money is getting spent (demand) in higher volumes than supply can match.

  "selftext": "I’ve thought about this a lot but I’ll try to keep this short and sweet. Please don’t patronizingly explain to me that “I could care less” actually means I do care, I’ve heard this explanation many times and I will refer to the opening paragraph of my post if that’s your response. \n\nReason one: Its purely idiomatic and you know what it means. Sometimes we negate sayings and they mean the same thing as they did because we’re so familiar with the saying. Example: “I can’t hardly wait” means the same as “I can hardly wait.” Bob Dylan’s song “you ain’t going nowhere” would’ve had the same meaning as if it were called “you ain’t going anywhere”\n\nReason two: It makes a little sense because if you don’t care very much, you probably don’t care enough to get the saying “right.” The idiom itself is about not caring, and so it’s fitting that one would make a remark that isn’t wholly accurate when properly parsed. \n\nReason three: Just because you COULD care less doesn’t mean you care a lot. 0 is less than 0.000001. \n\nReason four: If you grew up around people who used the saying “I could care less” the it has a certain meaning to you based on context and not on the actual meaning of the words. Nobody ever uses “I could care less” to mean that they indeed care. So I feel the disagreement about this saying is subtly about differences in culture and upbringing so maybe we shouldn’t be so pedantic about it.",

A RB fumble that's not returned is basically a spot turn over. Meanwhile, a muffed punt (or one that hits a blocker in the back of the leg) can be the equivalent of a 60 yard gain for the punting team.  \n\nThen we have rush issues. These include running into or roughing the punter, which automatically (roughing) or often (running into) result in first downs at a time the other team's trying to give you the ball back. Or they make it short and fourth and now your defense has to make another stop. There's also jumping offsides, which gives tons of free first downs. And there are fakes, which work against teams not playing it safe but trying to rush the punt. \n\nThere are also defensive issues on punts like blocks in the back, and holding.\n\nKeep in mind this is all happening at a time when the defense is actively trying to give you the ball back.\n\nSo for all this risk, we get, what? The one in a hundred punt block (which usually happens because your team is so much better than the other one that your special teamers are five stars riding the bench)? The incredibly rare decent return? A fair catch that saves about two first downs worth of yardage? That might have mattered in the three yards and a cloud of dust, 10-3 final score days of football, but these days it's just not worth the risk.\n\nSit in your base defense, don't rush, let them kick you the ball and let it roll dead.

This is because of their relatibility to larger audiences and their focus on telling good stories. Moreso, they have songs in them, which are frequently played at parties and other social events in the countries mentioned above. Due to the songs gaining popularity, more people would be inclined to watch these movies, which is why they have songs in them. Moreso, Bollywood releases more movies than Hollywood annually.\n\nMy 2nd reason is that South-Indian movies such as R.R.R., Enthiran 2, Bahubali, Bahubali 2, etc, have helped them gain popularity in countries such as Canada, the United States of America, France, The United Kingdom, Cuba, Germany, etc! 2022 was such a horrible year for Bollywood, with it releasing horrible movies such as Phone Bhoot, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Cirkus, etc! However, last year, which was 2023, Bollywood released such amazing movies such as Pathaan, Jawan, Dunki, Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahaani, Gadar 2, etc, while only 2 good South-Indian mpvies came out; Jailer and Salaar 1!

This is because South-Indian movies have been the perfect introduction to most Europeans and Americans to Indian cinema!\n\nMy 3rd reason is that Bollywood releases more movies per year. This means that there would be more hits than Hollywood. Eg.In 2014, films such as PK, Haider, Humpti Sharma Ki Dulhania, Happy New Year, Kick, Singham 2, etc, were all Bollywood films, whereas Hollywood only had The Hobbit:The Battle of the Five Armies, Maleficent, and Guardians of the Galaxy, which are only 3 films, compared to Bollywood's 6 films, which is as much as twice as much as Hollywood's. Another example is that in 2009, films such as Wanted, Rocket Singh:Salesman of the Year, 3 Idiots, Rab Ne Bana De Jodi, My Name Is Khan, Luck By Chance, etc, were all hit Bollywood movies, while only Up, Star Trek, and Avatar, were superhit movies released by Hollywood. Again, Bollywood released as many as twice as many hits as Hollywood.",

  "selftext": "We can’t spend our way out of it. We’ve tried. Look at the NYC public school system. We’ve shoveled dump trucks worth of money into their pockets and, while seeing some *marginal* improvements among some elements of the student body, have gotten nothing for it beyond more debt. America can’t wipe our asses for us, it’s not our mommy/daddy and we need to take responsibility for our lives and the lives of our children. And that means buckling down and making sure your kid is studying, doing their homework, **going to class** and in general giving two shits about their academic performance. No amount of money from the nanny state can fix that. Unfortunately, this problem is so deep and widely rooted I don’t know how the government *can* fix it.\n\nIn addition, the racial climate in America right now is just not conducive to discussions on a child’s poor performance. 69% of urban public schoolteachers in the United States are white. Using the New York state example, [black and latino students are more then 40% more likely to have a white public-school teacher](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/12/10/americas-public-school-teachers-are-far-less-racially-and-ethnically-diverse-than-their-students/ft_21-11-17_studentteacherrace_3/) then one more congruent to their skin color (though how this takes into effect mixed race schoolteachers and mixed-race students I have no clue.). To be clear, I’d rather slam my hand in a door then get between *any* parent and their child. But it gets even harder when you’re a blonde, white woman telling a black parent/parents “hey x kid is a real shithead in class and doesn’t work hard, study, or in general attend.” without immediately losing the parents or at the very least, raising severely their hackles.\n\nParents are already extremely defensive about their children and then if you add the ugly history of race relations in America on top of it? Not a conducive environment for early interventions in troubled students lives. It’s the sad truth but you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink. If the kid don’t care about reading, writing, or education in general you can’t force them to care. It has to come from the parent or guardian. And even then some people are happy to do the bare minimum required until they become magically rich via lotto ticket or until they die and when they have kids they pass the same values onto them, not explicitly obviously but via example.",

  "selftext": "If you're going to downvote, be kind enough to leave a comment so I know why. I'm open to changing my view.\n\nI don't believe a lot of the fatigue around Taylor Swift has to do with the person. After all, as a grown adult, she's entitled to enjoy a football game and cheer on her partner, like the rest of us.\n\nThe fatigue that I, and many of us are feeling are not directed at Taylor Swift the person, but the cottage industry that's been promoted by the NFL around the brand of Taylor Swift - two separate entities.\n\nI'm not complaining about the 30 seconds of airtime they give Taylor every Chiefs game. We've seen attention given to celebrities at sports events since I can remember.\n\nSpike Lee is prominently featured at Knicks games. Those old enough to remember the infamous battle he had on the sidelines with Reggie Miller understand how sports and celebrity merge into a melting pot of entertainment.\n\nDuring the 2018-19 basketball playoffs, we witnessed Drake coaching a team from the sidelines, giving hi-fives and pep talks to members of the Toronto Raptors, and yelling at coach Nick Nurse to put players in rotation as they won their championship.\n\nI didn't have a problem with any of that then - I don't have a problem with it now.\n\nThe issue, as I see it, is where these lines begin and end.\n\nWhereas with these previous examples, I was happy to partake in the pageantry that was those celebrity x sports moments, but I expected them to go no further than the end of the game. Maybe a spot or two on ESPN where replays are shown, and Drake highlights from these games.\n\nBut ever since Taylor showed up to her first Chiefs game to support Travis Kelce, there has been an entire sub-industry built around that, that bleeds into unexpected parts of the sports ecosystem.\n\nCase-in-point, within an hour of the Chiefs beating the Ravens, I received an Apple news alert that there was a way that Taylor could make it to the Superbowl from her Eras tour in Japan.\n\nI tune into my favorite fantasy football program and watch a 62-year-old man wearing a Taylor Swift t-shirt, breaking out into a segment where he is schooling the younger members on set on how to be a better swifty. Things that would seem, as the kids put it, 'creepy' and 'awkward' are now mainstream.\n\nI tune into a sports caster's show and have to sit through a lecture stating that if I have any objections to Taylor Swift, I am a misogynist loser and I don't have any strong women around me.\n\nAs if Taylor needed a bunch of middle-aged guys to come to her rescue.\n\nThese types of arguments might have some merit if these sports pundits throwing judgment weren't gaining financially from their speech. If they didn't look at the numbers and realize that the industry around Taylor Swift is good for their bottom line.\n\nUnfortunately, this has done nothing but once again polarize the country - you're either a swifty, flags out riding high, or you're a cave-dwelling ogre that has no place in society. When in reality, most of us sane people that may feel fatigued are not objecting to Taylor the person - we're objecting to the consequences of the rampant exploitation of her name.\n\nThe same sports league that blackballed Colin Kaepernick for being too political - hurting their money - is now welcoming this cottage industry that to them, makes sense on paper. If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what is.\n\nBut don't take my word for it - Travis Kelce, who is as close to the situation as one can get, also says that [the NFL is overdoing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P32_Y7xKb-E) when it comes to Taylor's brand.\n\n&#x200B;",

They benefit from being tough on crime. When politicians pass laws strengthening punitive measures it aids their campaigns. It gives their campaigns strength.\n\nBecause there's one guy who somehow molested 500 underaged girls, or kill 30 people, all prisoners must be treated horribly. That is what I believe the general attitude of Americans is. \n\nFor all notion of \"protect the children\", many of our laws do not effectively serve to effectively reduce criminal activity. For criminal activity to be reduced in America, it would require many things to be done. Not just prison reform. Currently, our political sphere seems disinterested in actually aiding the common man.\n\nAs a result of this sort of general problem with American politics, issues like prisons will never actually improve.\n\nIt will continue to be slavery, it will continue to be overcrowded, it will continue to be ineffective.

If someone is wanting to be understood in what they’re trying to convey, why is that upsetting? It’s like gatekeeping humor or communication or something? I really don’t understand it, and I’m just trying to make sense of it. Why do so many people care so much about something so unimportant or interesting? And with so much passion and dedication to hating the one specific tone tag. People have made spam bots regarding this. \n\nSome “/s” haters have said that they don’t like being called ableist for shitting on uses of it.

Looking at the 'benefits' of Psychadelics is just not convincing enough to legalize it; it just seems like they're so desperate for LSD, Psilocybin or MDMA to be miracle drugs, when in reality, being high just feels nice - Alcoholics and other addicts, as well as people suffering from depression will eventually slide back into their old ways after use of, say, LSD. In my personal experience, the most obnoxious addicts were addicted to Weed - they were having to leave the room every few hours to get high, and all they could talk about were the same, tired talking points about how 'The government is going to legalize it soon' and 'It cures Parkinsons and Cancer'.\r  \n\r  \nThe amount of research and interest that LSD and similar psychoactive substances are receiving right now, in my opinion, are mostly a waste of time. I just don't think there's anything incredible about these substances that are worth exploring, and think time is spent elsewhere. I'm not saying that nobody should be allowed to take these drugs (I have had 2 LSD trips and value the experiences), I just feel as if they're reaching for a conclusion that doesn't exist. The best, currently illegal drug (in the UK at least) seems to be Psilocybin, as that seems the safest and benefical to users.\r  \n\r  \nEven Microdosing; you know, this amazing, wonderful discovery that is curing depression, anxiety, and every other mental deffieciency under the sun? Yeah, it's a complete placebo effect, and there's a shit ton of studies to back that up. The reason for the current obsession with these drugs stems from the harsh laws put in place for dubious reasons by the American governement (and the rest of the world following suit), so we need to legalize it to make sure interested users get safe substances that aren't laced, and get advice on how to properly use it. Makes sense, right? Except, in theory, the work being done on LSD, MDMA etc, are being done in labs through government funding - this means that if you wanted a 'government safe' LSD trip, you'd most likely have to go to a specific area and be monitored by a doctor or relevant healthcare professional. Sounds like a fucking buzzkill to me.\r  \n\r  \nLongterm Ketamine use causes brain damage and depression, and Cannabis damages your lungs, kills your memory, your motivation; all under the stoned haze of 'I'm out of the system, man.

No\n\nPlease change my view, as all of what I've written is based on firsthand experience, a couple books - Andrew Pollan's 'How to Change your Mind' and 'Psychadelic' by David Nutt - and obviously viral videos online; so I know little more than that.",

My parents, being the financial failures that they are (mom works at a college as a learning centre coordinator and dad as a pharmacy manager in a grocery store whom my mom kept insisting to invest into a business but he was too spineless to take such a risk and now we're suffering financially as a result), couldn't seem to find it within themselves to be one of these high paying professions, so obviously I had to be the one to go take the mantle, all the while having to to watch so many rich spoiled peers my age indulging in themselves in things like big houses, nice cars, proper travelling, etc. \n\nIn grade 11, I thought of pursuing dentistry, but the problem was that not only did I struggle with math a lot, I also was dealing with a plethora of other conditions like my autism, depression, anxiety, and potential BPD (which a psychiatrist implied I might have when I saw them 2 years ago). Even with the accommodations I got though, I just couldn't seem to grasp many of the academic concepts required for these high-paying careers during my high school and undergrad years. As a result, me being the depressed, anxious, short-sighted person I was, decided to simply pursue nutrition sciences and become a dietitian because it was the easiest thing I could do.

Feeble academic jobs?\n\nTo be honest, I can't understand all these people my age who I keep seeing getting into med school, dental school, law school, or various engineering/finance programs, all the while I struggled with most of the foundational concepts, and let's not forget all of the \"experience gathering\" that would've been required for me to get into any of these schools to begin with.\n\nAs such, it got me thinking that these people were simply blessed with the genetics/talent to be able to grasp the academic concepts required to be able to get into these schools and inevitably succeed in them, whilst I couldn't no matter how hard I tried. Perhaps there might be some confounding given that I was dealing with a crap ton of mental stuff in my formative years, but a part of me thinks that even if I didn't have those negative experiences, that I still wouldn't be able to be one of these professions cause I just didn't have the genetics to be able to make it.\n\n**TLDR:** Becoming a high paying profession like a doctor, lawyer, engineer, banker (or other similar-paying careers) are mostly about genetic talent rather than hard work.",

  "selftext": "As it says on the tin, I have observed the silly culture wars, and the equally silly subwar of the gender wars. When I try to solve a problem, I try to dissolve and pick away at an issue until I have a sort of base dataset. The base requirement for humanity to survive in the future is the infamous 2.1 children per woman/whichever you prefer to call it. Reaching this, kind of, ephemeral statistic, would need a paradigm shift in how we, as humankind, as individuals, relate to the collective. While no kids would obviously lead to the demise of humanity, it would seem that more than three kids would, progressively, infringe on the kid's individuality (as the older kids become defacto babysitters), not to mention render the birth giver (if this is a forced position) into little more than breeding livestock. Now, there has to be a balance between the relationship between partners, the children and the respective freedom to realize themselves beyond parenthood. Furthermore, I see this, also, as a way of making the kids/offspring the most educated and qualified people for society at large, making this design the optimal way of furthering societal progress.\n\nHow would this be implemented in basic terms?\n\nThis obviously ends up running into the widely agreed and equally contentious idea of a \"breeding license\", which rubs up the sides of eugenics much more than most people are comfortable with. While that is a whole other intersecting debate, I'm not here to debate that in detail so I will refrain.\n\nOn a macro scale, everybody that can give birth to children have the right to make two children. Now it's often mentioned that most of rich countries do not have the sufficient 2.1 babies per birth giver, which sometimes gets pushed closer to the 2.1 via immigration. I'm the following I'm not necessarily going into the ethics, as this is already on shaky grounds without solidly consented-to foundation. We'd be here all day.\n\nThe 0.1 is to counter the unnatural deaths before an individual is able to multiply in the statistically median period one has children. With more people rendered infertile by genetics or pollution, this number would obviously rise. Getting past this, every birth giver, would have 2 children, and if they're interested in another, it would be compared to the national birth rate and be entered into a lottery. If the amount of \"needed\" babies is bigger than the amount of applicants, everybody gets an approval.\n\nI think a lot of the initial \"I don't want to have a child\"-reaction is, because society is made to be perpetually unsafe and unstable with badly designed laws and incentives that are badly thought through, which forces individuals to choose either parenthood or career, because it is assessed that doing both is way too stressful, expensive and difficult. I, personally, think that blaming individuals for not having children is barking up the wrong tree, because we are not even trying to make the environment conducive to bringing around the result, which seems to go against basic social scientific axioms.\n\nI know this is a controversial take, but without, at the very least, theoretical experiments, it's going to be very hard to direct the way society evolves.",

  "selftext": "Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity is a quote often cited to excuse some really messed up shit. The quote essentially means that if you can't prove it's malice then just assume it's stupidity. However there's the underlining assumption in our culture or perhaps it's even implied in the quote that stupidity isn't as bad as malice... and often people take this a step further an think there should be no punishment at all for blatant repeated incompetence that may or may not be actual malice and outright criminal intent. \n\nI live in Canada and the ArriveCan app an app that could easily be built for 100k costed 54 million. So two basic possibilities. First it's blatant criminal fraud with dozens of government workers and MPs involved. Second every single MP and government employee involved in it in anyway as well as the people who they hired to built the app is insanely stupid and incompetent. Like we are talking about a level like taking a random 5 year old out of kindergarten and giving them an unlimited budget and time to do something that they are currently incapable of but not as some kind of study or experiment something that the government actually needs done as soon as possible... \n\nHow the fuck is that level of stupidity better than criminal fraud? How is it acceptable that any of those people have a fucking job and get elected? Maybe morally if they really are that just that fucking stupid it's the fault of the people who put them in that position but who's to say those people aren't just that fucking stupid to. I don't really think there's an argument that anyone who votes for Trudeau and his liberals at this point (and even last election) isn't extremely stupid. \n\nLogistically, mechanically that level of stupidity is just unforgivable to me, especially when it's people in positions of power. It's just as bad as malice probably even more dangerous (in the case of Trudeau's Liberals I believe to be both criminal malice and insane incompetence) at least if someone is a sane actor unless they explicitly want to destroy everything if they are just looking to enrich themselves they would do a much better job even with criminal fraud than someone that fucking stupid. \n\nStupidity needs consequences we can't just keep doing like like paying 54 Million for something that should cost 100k or bringing in 1.6 million people a year in a country that builds 250k housing units. A fucking 3rd grader could realize how bad these policies are with their level of math skills yet the people in charge are too fucking stupid to? And because we can't prove outright malice and they could just be that fucking stupid there's no consequences? No removals, no pitchforks no guillotines. Hell they don't even lose that many votes...

  "selftext": "Hello everyone,  \n\nI hope you're well. I've been wrestling with two \"philosophical\" questions that\nI find quite unsettling, to the point where I feel like life may not be worth\nliving because of what they imply. Hopefully someone here will offer me a new\nperspective on them that will give me a more positive outlook on life.  \n\n---\n\n**(1) Why live this life and do anything at all if humanity is doomed to go extinct?**  \n\nI think that, if we do not take religious beliefs into account, humanity is\ndoomed to go extinct, and therefore, everything we do is ultimately for nothing,\nas the end result will always be the same: an empty and silent universe devoid of human\nlife and consciousness.    \n\nI think that humanity is doomed to go extinct, because it needs a source of\nenergy (e.g. the Sun) to survive. However, the Sun will eventually die and life\non Earth will become impossible. Even if we colonize other habitable planets,\nthe stars they are orbiting will eventually die too, so on and so forth until\nevery star in the universe has died and every planet has become inhabitable.  \nEven if we manage to live on an artificial planet, or in some sort of human-made\nspaceship, we will still need a source of energy to live off of, and one day there\nwill be none left.  \nTherefore, the end result will always be the same: a universe devoid of human\nlife and consciousness with the remnants of human civilization (and Elon Musk's Tesla)\nsilently floating in space as a testament to our bygone existence. It then does not\nmatter if we develop economically, scientifically, and technologically; if we end\nworld hunger and cure cancer; if we bring poverty and human suffering to an end, etc.;\nwe might as well put an end to our collective existence today. If we try to live a happy\nlife nonetheless, we'll still know deep down that nothing we do really matters.  \n\nWhy do anything at all, if all we do is ultimately for nothing?\n\n---\n\n**(2) Why live this life if the development of civilization will eventually lead\nto a life devoid of fulfilment and happiness?**  \n\nI also think that if, in a remote future, humanity has managed to develop\ncivilization to its fullest extent, having founded every company imaginable;\nhaving proved every theorem, run every experiment and conducted every scientific\nstudy possible; having invented every technology conceivable; having automated\nall meaningful work there is: how then will we manage to find fulfilment in life\nthrough work?  \n\nAt such time, all work, and especially all fulfilling work, will have already\nbeen done or automated by someone else, so there will be no work left to do.  \n\nIf we fall back to leisure, I believe that we will eventually run out of\nleisurely activities to do. We will have read every book, watched every\nmovie, played every game, eaten at every restaurant, laid on every beach,\nswum in every sea: we will eventually get bored of every hobby there is and\nof all the fun to be had. (Even if we cannot literally read every book or watch\nevery movie there is, we will still eventually find their stories and plots to be\nsimilar and repetitive.)  \n\nAt such time, all leisure will become unappealing and boring.  \n\nTherefore, when we reach that era, we will become unable to find fulfillment and\nhappiness in life neither through work nor through leisure. We will then not\nhave much to do, but to wait for our death.  \n\nIn that case, why live and work to develop civilization and solve all of the\nworld's problems if doing so will eventually lead us to a state of unfulfillment,\nboredom and misery? How will we manage to remain happy even then?  \n\n---\n\nI know that these scenarios are hypothetical and will only be relevant in a\nvery far future, but I find them disturbing and they genuinely bother me, in the\nsense that their implications seem to rationally make life not worth living.  \n\nI'd appreciate any thoughts and arguments that could help me put these ideas into\nperspective and put them behind me, especially if they can settle these questions for\ngood and definitively prove these reasonings to be flawed or wrong, rather than offer\ncoping mechanisms to live happily in spite of them being true.  \n\nThank you for engaging with these thoughts.\n\n---\n\n**Edit.**\n\nAfter having read through about a hundred answers (here and elsewhere), here are some key takeaways:\n\n**Why live this life and do anything at all if humanity is doomed to go extinct?**\n\n* My argument about the extinction of humanity seems logical, but we could very well eventually find out that it is totally wrong. We may not be doomed to go extinct, which means that what we do wouldn't be for nothing, as humanity would keep benefitting from it perpetually.\n* We are at an extremely early stage of the advancement of science, when looking at it on a cosmic timescale. Over such a long time, we may well come to an understanding of the Universe that allows us to see past the limits I've outlined in my original post.\n* (Even if it's all for nothing, if we enjoy ourselves and we do not care that it's pointless, then it will not matter to us that it's all for nothing, as the fun we're having makes life worthwhile in and of itself. Also, if what we do impacts us positively right now, even if it's all for nothing ultimately, it will still matter to us as it won't be for nothing for as long as humanity still benefits from it.)\n\n**Why live this life if the development of civilization will eventually lead to a life devoid of fulfilment and happiness?**\n\n* This is not possible, because we'd either have the meaningful work of improving our situation (making ourselves fulfilled and happy), or we would be fulfilled and happy, even if there was no work left.\n* I have underestimated for how long one can remain fulfilled with hobbies alone, given that one has enough hobbies. One could spend the rest of their lives doing a handful of hobbies (e.g., travelling, painting, reading non-fiction, reading fiction, playing games) and they would not have enough time to exhaust all of these hobbies.\n* We would not get bored of a given food, book, movie, game, etc., because we could cycle through a large number of them, and by the time we reach the end of the cycle (if we ever do), then we will have forgotten the taste of the first foods and the stories of the first books and movies. Even if we didn't forget the taste of the first foods, we would not have eaten them frequently at all, so we would not have gotten bored of them. Also, there can be a lot of variation within a game like Chess or Go. We might get bored of Chess itself, but then we could simply cycle through several games (or more generally hobbies), and come back to the first game with renewed eagerness to play after some time has passed.\n* One day we may have the technology to change our nature and alter our minds to not feel bored, make us forget things on demand, increase our happiness, and remove negative feelings.\n\n**Recommended readings (from the commenters)**\n\n* *Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World* by Nick Bostrom\n* [*The Fun Theory Sequence*](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K4aGvLnHvYgX9pZHS/the-fun-theory-sequence) by Eliezer Yudkowski\n* *The Beginning of Infinity* by David Deutsch\n* *Into the Cool* by Eric D.

Read the lyrics of the entire album, from start to finish, and understand the perspective zooms in and out, sometimes switching between victims and perpetrators, or acknowledging either could be both, at once, or in sequence.\n\nThe narrator is clearly playing roles most love to hate. A conqueror on a battlefield. A rapist. A pundit who encourages lawlessness. An executioner. A condemned soul. A high-ranking Nazi. A homosexual cannibal. Satan themselves. \n\nWe, the educated among the audience, know those writers/performers are not truly any of those things. They are satirizing those things, in an expression of anger, frustration, and derision. Fans of the band often gathered to listen to the live performance of the material, and shove eachother around, in mosh pits, in a cathartic, communal release of justified anger, at the state of the world depicted. \n\nThe material promotes understanding the perspectives of others, even those we may find distasteful, the abandonment of dogmatic bias or bigoted thinking, and even the need for compassion, grace, and salvation, to save tarnished souls from a system that would otherwise predetermine their terrible fates. \n\nI also tend to believe castigators of the material are either ignorant to its true nature, and the intention and Hindenburg humanity behind it, or they are insecure about depicted tendencies within themselves. \n\nIs Slayer in general most likely an unhealthy thing to obsess over? Probably, but the same can be said about almost any obsession. Have some listeners identified too much with the roles depicted, and emulated them, to a point of committing crimes against others? Probably. Has at least one of its members repeatedly said he wanted to be a 'bad' influence, in the form of a devil on the listener's shoulder? Yes.\n\nWould the album be and has the album been an apt soundtrack to violent crime? Probably. Are the artists guilty of terrorism and incitement? Arguably. Would their powerful music industry lawyers get them off, if ever tried, while lower-status artists are jailed, for far less serious or impactful offences? Likely. \n\nCould potentially anyone of any race, gender, creed, political persuasion, or lack thereof, enjoy the album, regardless? Possibly. Have some women suggested we have sex, to the album? Yes. What is more offensive about the album? Its lyrics? Or its breakneck pace, thundering drums, ear-splitting, high-pitched cacophony of staccato sixteenths, chromatic 'diabolus en musica' melodic theory, or the chunky growl of its punishing rhythms?",

  "title": "CMV: the post text has a better definition of racism in the US than any others now existing.",
  "selftext": "Definition:  Racism in America is an ongoing, frequently nonviolent attack on black people.  It is intentional, brutal, insidious, political, constantly changing, appearing and disappearing, at least partly subconscious, and unidirectional.  Its signature displays of power are in the past, with race riots, lynchings, assassinations, and Jim Crow; today it can be seen in the disparate outcomes observable in a wide range of settings, such as housing, employment, education, health care and the justice system, and in the wildly skewed marriage rates, between whites and blacks.  If you go by marriage rates, as some do, we are (as a country) at 98% of our capacity for racism.  The cure for racism is to raise those marriage rates, and become one people.  We could do this, very easily, but unfortunately this is in fact a racist country, and we don't want to.\n\nDefense:  the problem with existing definitions is, none of them give you any feel for what racism really is.  They define it as though it were easy to confuse racism with normal behavior.  And in some cases it is; but in general, no.  Taken as a whole, racism is very different from normal behavior.  And whatever definition we use should make that clear.  So my first defense is:  this succeeds at that.\n\nSecondly, the suggestion that only blacks suffer from racism, in the US, needs some defense.  To me, the marriage rate discrepancies make clear:  racism, at its bottom, is an insult, not of a person by another person, but of a people by another people.  It's a group thing.  A social behavior, just like ants build nests.  One ant, all by itself, doesn't build nests; it wanders around and dies.  It takes a village, to be racist.  A people.  And so whether individual white guys do or do not marry black women has nothing to do with it.  It's a tendency of the society, observable only in the bulk statistics.  No black person can ever insult a white person by evoking or referencing that social insult, because it doesn't exist on the black side.  And so racism is just one way.\n\nI might add that I think an excellent test of the sincerity of conservative and Republican opposition to racism ought to be found in their embrace of a unidirectional definition of racism.  If they accept a unidirectional definition, then we can lower the temperature on the topic and have a real discussion.  Not until then.\n\nThe other defense of the idea that only blacks suffer from racism, in the US, is addressed to those who say, good golly, there are other races here!  No.  There aren't.  There are whites, soon-to-be whites, and blacks, and that is all.  If you can find me another so called race that a) is geographically contiguous with white people and b) exhibits a similar marriage barrier with white people, I will admit I'm wrong.  In the absence of a similar other-race/white marriage barrier - and if, as I suspect, every other so called race in the US works to perpetuate a white style marriage barrier with black people - these other so called races are either white or soon to be white.\n\nNow I want to explain the adjectives I used to characterize the whole, just in case there's some misunderstanding:\n\nIntentional is a curious word, because it can be used for conscious behavior, subconscious quasi-instinctive behavior, and heritable behavior (sociobiology).  It's frequently abused in evolutionary science, because of course nature is widely believed not to have any real intent - and yet her results, for example ants' nests or human eyeballs, frequently appear intentional.  Here I use it only in (but in both) the conscious and subconscious quasi-instinctive senses.  Conscious racism, for example, may result in the legal transfer of a school system's property to a private, non-governmental entity, to avoid integration laws.  Subconscious racism results in the marriage rate discrepancy we discover when we examine bulk statistical marriage behaviors.\n\nBrutal should need no introduction, but it's not mentioned in any other definition of racism.  That is just wrong.  Brutality is the most important attribute of racism.\n\nInsidious is normally used to give emotional effect, and I do mean that by it, but I also mean racism pops up here and there, seemingly out of nowhere, and seems to hide very well and be able to spend a long time considering its next move, which often seems carefully considered and politically sophisticated.  Racism has access to our best legal and political minds, and uses them with great effect.  There might be a better word than insidious, if brutal were not the second word, but since it is, insidious is probably the best third descriptor.\n\nPolitical is important because someone reading the dictionary definition today, the standard issue, left or right, might not be able to imagine how much access racism has to the levers of political power, or how frighteningly unstoppable a steamroller can appear when political forces align behind it.\n\nAnd finally, no standard definition, left or right, points to a cure.  If you look up malaria in the dictionary, you'll find the name of the bug that causes it.  Shouldn't we do that, with racism?  This definition does that.\n\nEDIT:  I've changed \"silent war\" to \"ongoing, frequently nonviolent attack;\" pseudowhite to soon to be white; and I've added the descriptors intentional, conscious and subconscious.  Thank you to all who have helped with this!",

In extreme cases, the party that comes second in national vote share can will a majority of seats (see also: US Presidential elections).\n* Small parties have no chance of fair representation, which means people are discouraged from voting first preference, if they prefer a small party.\n* Various technical points around social utility and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem.\n\nMy view for discussion is that approval voting -- that is, vote for as many candidates as you like -- would be the quickest and simplest way to improve this. This is because:\n\n* It's easy to understand. \"Vote for as many candidates as you like.\"\n* It's easy to count. Whoever gets the most votes, wins.\n* It takes away the risk of voting third party. You can simply vote for the third party AND for whichever you prefer of the main two.\n* It removes the need to rank (implicitly or explicitly) candidates.\n* Edit: if people misunderstand what they're supposed to be doing and treat it like FPTP, it still works. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: a lot of people saying we should go to RCV instead. I'll quote some text from u/Nytshaed on that, below. These problems rule RCV out for me.\n\nIssues with RCV not found in approval, FPTP, score, or STAR:\n\n* RCV is non-monotonic. This means that sometimes voting for your favorite as ranked 1 can cause them to lose, which voting dishonestly for someone else as your ranked 1 can cause your favorite to win. This happens since it does a serious of FPTP elections essentially that eliminate people one by one. This is essentially vote splitting but in each round, so the vote splitting in earlier rounds can cause your favorite to win or lose by strategically trying to cause vote splitting in earlier rounds of elimination.\n* As stated in the above: there is a unique kind of vote splitting in RCV\n* RCV is not precinct summable: this means it requires a central location of tabulation rather than the decentralized way of voting we use in the US today. This requires way more time to get election results, a lot more money to run elections, and decreases election security as election fraud only needs to compromise a single node rather than many decentralized nodes to be effective.\n* RCV is extremely hard to audit compared to FPTP, approval, or the other mentioned voting methods. The dimensionality of it makes statistical sample audits almost impossible.\n* RCV historically causes large increases in invalidated ballots. The more complex your voting system, the more you need to educate voters to prevent disenfranchisement. It's essentially impossible to create invalid approval, star, or score ballots.\n* I can understand wanting more expressiveness than approval, but then I would just say support STAR voting then. Approval works really well for how simple the change is and doesn't come with any added drawbacks over what we have today. STAR is more complex (you score each candidate from 0-5), but it comes with far less issues than RCV does.\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "And that includes working with the Democratic party **only until** we have achieved the systemic reforms necessary for more than two parties to compete in America.\n\nBy American Left I’m referring to American left of capitalism.\n\nThis isn’t an argument for lesser evilism, how the Dems don't really suck, or saying that the left needs to be more liberal. In my view, this is the most realistic path to realizing the left’s political power in America. It starts by convincing everyone who will listen that systemic reforms are the only issue worthy of a single issue voter\n\nWe can talk in circles about ideology, genocide, climate change, and all kinds of problems for the rest of our lives, and nothing will come of it if the American Left does not obtain any political power to act with.\n\nCut and dry, the premises of my argument:\n\n1. I still believe in Democracy and recognize that we, referring to American anti-capitalists , are few in number compared to liberals and conservatives.\n2. If we, as the organized American left, don't have the numbers to win primaries (House, Senate, State, Local included), we have no business talking revolution. We need time to build class consciousness and have leftist policies discussed in front of wider audiences. This means that we actively participate in the electoral system instead of turning our backs on it.\n3. Moving on from FPTP to RCV or alternative voting systems will open the door for third party voting by virtually eliminating the election-math penalty for voting for longshot candidates. This is the single most import issue for state-level candidates.\n4. Every one of our goals will be more difficult to achieve so long as capitalists are free to buy politicians and fund their campaigns. We should amplify candidates who are LOUD about all the places where big money shakes hands with politics. The cornerstone policies of their platform should target the mechanisms by which financial capital can be exchanged with political capital. Absolute financial transparency for politicians, or whatever plays well to a wide audience. We need to level the playing field against capitalist-backed candidates.\n5. If we are able to lessen or remove capital's undue influence on government, both major political parties will become weaker and we will have created a fantastic opportunity to break off into a new party. Ideally Libertarians or other groups would split off from Republicans too, which would basically give us a coalition government. We see the balance of political power will ebb from the wealthy and flow towards sheer democratic will, and perhaps we could experience a form of political renaissance where politics is no longer thought of as a one-dimensional line.\n\nWe have a long road between us and our goals, but achieving reforms like this could give us a ridiculous momentum boost. Let’s put reallocation of the means of production on the back burner, and strive for a legitimately valuable near-term win. We could find common ground with voters across the entire political spectrum by getting laser-focused on systemic reforms that weaken the corporate duopoly. To me, these reforms seem like a first realistic big win for the left. Mitigating capitalist power and opening the door for third party challenges will make every other goal more attainable\n\nIf you think there are higher priority policy goals for the American Left, what are they and why?",

  "title": "CMV: Liberalism is more of a moderate right wing ideology, or centrist ideology than a left wing ideology",
  "selftext": "Liberalism as a political philosophy is more or less a combination of conservative and socialist ideas and acts like a middle ground between the left wing socialists and the right wing conservatives. \n\nLiberals like conservatives believe in private ownership of corporations, private ownership of the means of production, and private ownership of land. \n\nLiberals like conservatives believe in not just market based, but market driven economies\n\nIn Europe and Australia liberals are synonymous with free market conservatives/libertarians \n\n>Over time, the meaning of liberalism began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: \"In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies.\"[29] Consequently, the ideas of individualism and laissez-faire economics previously associated with classical liberalism are key components of modern American conservatism\n\nSo conservatism and liberalism would have a lot of overlap. This is especially representative with neoliberalism. \n\nNeoliberalism would have a huge wave in the 1980's brought on by American republican Ronald Reagan, British conservative Margaret Thatcher, and other conservative parties throughout the world including the Canadian conservative party, the Australian liberal party, and more. But it is important to note they are all right wing parties. \n\nDon't get me wrong, liberalism has some things it shares with socialism \n\nLiberalism and socialism both believe in a secular state and freedom of religion\n\nBoth liberalism and socialism share a focus on human and civil rights \n\nHowever I'm reluctant to call liberalism a left wing ideology because it lacks many things other left wing ideologies have in common like social ownership. There's multiple different types of social ownership, but liberalism doesn't offer any of them. \n\nUnion strengthening, union support are hallmarks of socialism, yet liberal parties give unions the bare minimum. The countries with strong unions have them because of democratic socialist parties that strengthened them. \n\nThere's no redistribution of wealth under liberalism. \n\nUnder liberalism, public infrastructure and public health still gets minimal spending, and private companies are still invited in all the time to increase costs by asking for profit on top of cost of materials and labour, which either means the government pays more or the labourers get paid less, but usually it's a bit of both. This happens in public healthcare and public infrastructure construction. \n\n(When I say socialism, I don't mean communist, or anarchist and when I say conservative I don't mean fascist, monarchists, or anarcho-capatilists.)\n\nAnd socialism, liberalism, and conservatism also all share ideologies as well.  they all believe in a state governed by a citizen elected body. They all believe in the rule of law. They all believe \n\nBut overall I would have to say Liberalism is not a very left wing ideology at all, and amounts to something near moderate centrism.\n\nEdit: most modern political parties sort themselves into international organizations. International democrat union (union if conservative parties) liberals international, progressive alliance, socialist international, and global greens. \n\nIn the west, most democratic socialists parties separated from socialists international in 2013 to become the progressive alliance. \n\nThe IDU places themselves firmly on the right. Progressive alliance and global greens are firmly on the left. And then there's liberals who seems to have overlap with both conservatives and progressives. They agree with conservatives on many economic principles, but agree with progressives on human and civil rights. \n\nMany of the leaders in liberals international describe themselves as believers in the third way. \n\nThird way - is a centrist political position that attempts to reconcile centre-right and centre-left politics by synthesising a combination of economically liberal and social democratic economic policies along with centre-left social policies.\n\nSo by definition most liberal parties and leaders are striving for centrism.

  "selftext": "I think ABA therapy is abuse for autistic children, here is why\n\n1: ABA Is like dog training but for autistic people (mostly children). It is all about obedience and compliance. If the child does something that the therapist likes, they get a reward. If the child does something the therapist doesn't like, they get a punishment or as they call it, a \"negative reinforcement). I know that a lot of ABA centres these days don't use negative reinforcement but with positive inforcements, they are manipulating the child or the client to do what the therapist wants them to do.\n\n2: In a lot of these places, food is used as a reward so food will be withheld from the child until the child does what the therapist wants them to do. You don't ever withhold food from a child, ever.\n\n3: In a lot of these places, non-harmful stims are supressed and the child is forced or manipulated into making eye contact with the therapist. This teaches masking which can lead to mental health issues which can lead to a lot of horrible things (such as suicide). The suicide rate for autistic people is much higher than for people who are not autistic. I know making eye contact is what you are \"supposed\" to do but if a person forces themselves to make eye contact to the point where they have mental health issues/burnout. It is a problem. \n\n4: ABA teaches their clients that their feelings/boundaries don't matter. If the child needs a break, give them a break. Respect that. If they are overwhelmed and need a break, give them a break. If they don't like loud noises/touch, respect that\n\nA lot of people say that it's different now. But ask yourself. Is your child forced to surpress their stims or make eye contact? Are they being punished or manipulated into compliance? Is food withheld from them? Are their boundaries being respected?\n\nI know things changes with time, but how much has ABA really changed?",

  "selftext": "Quick edit: weird, when i posted this it got deleted but now it suddenly appeared in the sub. Will check replies soon.\n\n# Good vs Bad laws\n\nVery important to realize here is that both good laws and bad laws exist. Many people, myself included, are able to apply common sense to tell whether a law should or shouldn't be strictly followed (sometimes depending on a situation)\n\n* Should \"don't murder\" be obeyed? Obviously: yes.\n* Should \"wait at the red light\" be obeyed when, you have perfect 360 view and you're 100% sure that there is absolutely no traffic in a one mile distance around you? Obviously no.\n\nNote: I'm not saying that \"wait at the red light\" is a bad law by default. But in this   \n specific example, it is. Even good laws are not always useful in every situation.\n\n# Flawed politicians, flawed laws\n\nThere are people with good intentions and there are people with bad intentions. How do we prevent bad people from doing bad things? Right by making laws. But ooops we run into a problem: laws have to be made by HUMANS. So there is a chance laws will be made by a person with bad intentions. Now what good does that do? And no, this is not a question of \"what if\" - bad or useless laws already exist\n\n\"you are not above the law\" No. I'm not necessarily above the law.. but im not below it either. The law is made by another human, just as capable of making mistakes and having bad intentions, who is no better than me, therefore I have no reason to obey.\n\nThe law saying \"don't murder\" could have been \"you have to murder someone every day\". Fortunately it isnt this way, but since politicians are human like all of us, and one day a politician might think murder is a very good thing, its possible that this law could exist. It proves my point, the only thing making this world a better place is good people, not laws. Making rules or guidelines is okay but no one should have to follow those if they don't want to.\n\n# Laws that are not about morality\n\nYou might even say laws are not always about morality: for example, the law says everyone has to be on the right side of the road. Good, this prevents many crashes. But if you ask me, even this law is not necessary. Remove the law and people will still be on the right side of the road as an unwritten rule. If someone chooses the left side and crashes into oncoming traffic, then they are an idiot for driving into oncoming traffic, not for disobeying the law.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf laws didnt exist then yes bad people would be able to do bad things and get away with it. But when laws exist, bad people can become politicians and make bad laws. So laws either way its a lose-lose situation.\n\nIn a world with only good people, laws are not needed.\n\nIn a world with only bad people, there is not one good person who can make good laws.\n\nIn this world murder is illegal but somewhere in another universe there is a law that forces people to murder. You might say \"youre not above the law\" but all I can say: the law is not above me either.\n\nThe best way to live life is to be a good person and apply common sense to each unique situation. There is no reason to live your life in the way that someone in a suit wants you to.\n\nNote: if I don't murder, that doesn't automatically mean I'm obeying the law. I would only be obeying the law if I intended to murder, but didnt because its illegal. But in my case, I don't murder because I don't desire to do that. Its my own decision, not the decision of someone in a suit.",

If any flaw is to be found in the leadership of the church, their actions, doctrines and policies, then the whole arguments of the religious crumble because “if your religion is supposed to be perfect, then what about…” This can happen by bringing up controversial events that happened in the past such as The Church Of Jesus Christ not allowing African members to hold the priesthood until the 1970’s or more current scandals and events like stories about recent sexual abuse by members of church leadership.\n\nAlso, religion often advocates for abstaining from or restraining oneself from the many pleasures you can partake in as a human such  sex, drugs, alcohol and so on. These things can be addicting, and it’s hard for people to restrain or abstain themselves from addicting substances or practices. \n\nIt’s easier and more pleasurable in the moment to have sex with whoever you want whenever you want, do drugs, drink alcohol and watch porn than it is to adhere to strict religious guidelines that restrict or completely forbid those sorts of things or activities.\n\nPeople can say “I don’t need a religion to live a good life, I’ll just do stuff in moderation”\n\nPeople nowadays hate being told what to do by religion but seem to be ok if it’s by the government, social media or celebrities\n\nIt’s also easier for people to lounge around at home or participate in their favorite leisure activities than it is for them to regularly attend religious worship services.\n\nThere are also a lot of misconceptions or stereotypes about religion in general or specific religions that may prevent people from joining religion or a specific religion, where those stereotypes or info they know about the religion is true or not.\n\nI could go on but those seem to be the main reasons why it’s hard to convert people to religion or keep them within a religion",

  "selftext": "First off, I'd prefer that this not turn into a broader discussion of whether the death penalty itself is wrong. That's a separate topic.\n\nThe Constitution has a ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. But death-penalty advocates have taken this to such an extreme that they consider even the slightest discomfort or pain to be \"cruel and unusual.\" If the lethal-injection chemicals cause discomfort in the vein, that's \"cruel and unusual.\" If they cause chest discomfort or other discomfort, that's \"cruel and unusual.\" When Alabama was using nitrogen to execute an inmate (which is literally one of the most humane methods possible,) they claimed it was cruel and unusual. etc.\n\nMy view of the Constitution is that \"cruel and unusual\" means some form of punishment that goes *exceptionally, intentionally, beyond the norm*. So, for instance, if the state of Texas were to sentence a criminal to die by being fed alive into a wood chipper or roasted over a barbecue, that would be cruel and unusual. That would clearly be done for no purpose other than sadism. But normal methods of execution - such as lethal injection - fall perfectly well within \"acceptable parameters\" of an execution. There may be some discomfort involved (after all, this is a procedure meant to *kill* you) but as long as it's within *normal* parameters, it is permissible.\n\nBear in mind that at the time that the Founders wrote the Constitution, executions by methods such as hanging were perfectly acceptable - so it's clear they didn't intend the death penalty to fall under the \"cruel and unusual\" category if it were performed reasonably humanely. A moderate amount of pain and discomfort does **not** count as \"cruel and unusual.\"\n\nBut death penalty opponents have taken their stance to such an extreme that any form of execution that isn't floating away to Heaven on blissful clouds of serene peace and tranquility, without the slightest pain, is considered to be \"cruel and unusual.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - CMV: No matter how pain-free an execution method may be, death-penalty opponents will move the goalposts to claim that it's still too painful or uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "I was inspired to post this here after reading an article in late 2022 early 2023 after the Supreme Court decision that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion (the Dobbs decision) that overturned roe v wade. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2022/06/29/relationships-post-roe/&ved=2ahUKEwif6JzHkZiEAxXsm4kEHQ-1AmQ4ChDF9AEoAHoECAsQAg&usg=AOvVaw1d0y_ODgBmhuXN63xJR_KK\n\nIt says that more and more couples are reevaluating their long term relationships with their partners or spouses over the controversial dobbs decision in June of 2022. Many hadn't had that conversation with their partners or considered their partners postions at all. In the article it states how many are asking new partners or dates how they feel about it early on to see if they would be on the same page or if they should end the relationship before it gets more serious.\n\nNow that got me thinking. I believe that it's extremely healthy for dates and new couples to talk extensively about politics in the beginning of relationships. When you think of it politics controls alot of out lives whether its a supreme court decision like dobbs or roe or a local issue like the town council expanding a local park both those issues involve politics. So how does not talking about politics early in a relationship not benefit people really by seeing if a potential spouse and you have the same values in life. Even ben Shapiro agrees with this \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://m.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr1cK1WoL2HE&ved=2ahUKEwi59cuplpiEAxU_jYkEHc4ZBzIQFnoECBkQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2QWbRsuE0M6ksLhrHZza3O\n\nNow many will say politics doesn't equal values and that you shouldn't limit yourself or not want to date people bases on their political opinions. A famous couple who are in a relationship like that are democratic strategist James Carville and his wife republican strategist Mary matalin make it work (despite her joining the libertarian party with the rise of trump). I argue relationships like that came to be in an Era when Americans weren't \"political\" in a sense but since 2016 America has become a very political nation like European counties. Which can be shown with this study from the United Kingdom \n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dating-relationships-tory-politics-b2095705.html&ved=2ahUKEwjNkr78pZiEAxXsjIkEHXkgDkcQFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0Q6gE6zFYeFPiTgHYYsdoN\n\nSo I think debating and learning someone's politics early in a relationship is a healthy thing to do. Why would I want to invest time and energy in a relationship with someone whom I don't share my values (this is especially true if your non religious) why would I want to buy a house with someone who doesn't think climate change is real and wants to buy a beach house because nothing will happen. Why would I want to date someone who treats a homeless person with disdain if I value empathy and especially with bodily autonomy why would a woman want to date a man who doesn't value her bodily autonomy and why should I who might value euthanasia and \"pulling the plug\" want to date someone who doesn't belive in that either. Americans have (albeit an increasingly less) interest or stomach for giving their political opinions in public especially in the dating world and I think that in order to not waste either parties time that should and need to change.",

I don’t think either that reporting them to their supervisor would be helpful in fixing their behavior or helping me not be public enemy No. 1 on the job-site.\n\nInterested in what people say, kinda wish I thought differently but I can’t see a good reason to speak up.\n\nEdit: Thought I’d sum up how my position has changed from what I wrote here. I have read every reply to this post and my comments even if I haven’t responded.\n\nWhile most of you agree on my first point that I will not change hearts and minds a lot of people have brought up a good point of shifting things the right direction. I agree and realize I haven’t done enough.\n\nSecondly a lot of you have been saying I’m a coward or weak for not standing up for my values. I wish I had the strength that you all have, but I also don’t think many of you understand the culture I was in. If you did you might not think so little of me but I understand your frustrations.\n\nI do think I haven’t been doing enough, a lot of you have successfully changed how I feel about speaking out or separating myself from bigotry. I will try to do better, but I don’t think I have the gifts of wit that many of you have suggested. I haven’t awarded any deltas over this, mainly because no one comment truly caused a change of heart.\n\nFinally, I understand this is not a victimless issue. I have awarded two deltas over this fact and they are both very convincing.\n\nThanks for all who replied. I don’t think I will be making any grand speeches, but I will be better to make my workplace more welcoming. I will keep reading.",

  "selftext": "So you are Japan or some other first world country whose birth rate is no longer increasing faster than your population is decreasing. This creates an inordinate burden on the young productive members of your society to produce enough and subsidize the larger retirement population of your country. Clearly we must fix this! We need to increase our population growth so that we are creating more workers than we’re losing! And we will presumably need to continue doing this for the foreseeable if we want to avoid this economic catastrophe. So clearly we need our population grow at greater and greater quantities until the end of time!\n\nBut wait a second, did our chain of logic to solving an economic problem LITERALLY just become we need an infinitely increasing population? That’s ridiculous there is no infinite earth.\n\nThis right here is almost a memetic representation of the problems with unrestrained capitalism: you can’t enforce the artificial restraints of infinite growth inherent to a capitalist system on the real finite and limited world. And the fact the economic demands of the current system are viewed as inelastic compared to having a population which never decreases or just maintains  in size demonstrates how ingrained it is. \n\nPeople might answer “sure we need to increase the population now but not forever. We can work on having a steady population size create a steady economic state in the future”. \n\nI would ask “why the hell would now not be the perfect time to work at a steady state?”.  If you are a first world country that is facing these types of issues you have a massive amount of resources being produced per capita due to technology. Society has never been in such a clear position of having so much surplus that it could clearly maintain a constant population in good conditions if it figured out how to distribute stuff. We are also naturally having populations decline. If you don’t try and solve this problem when your own population naturally starts to decrease when else are going to solve it? \n\nIt just seems like shunting the problem to the nebulous future like how we dealt with climate and environmental problems. \n\nObviously implementation of the transition to an economy which functions with a constant population will be difficult and I am personally not equipped for drafting a proposal for such robust changes to our economic framework. But if the alternative viewpoint leads to the unexamined suggestion of REQUIRING literally infinite future population growth to maintain a stable economy then perhaps we should acknowledge the inherent impossibility and absurdity of that.",

Besides, having some emotional issues is just part of life, as far as I can tell.

Also, a weekend from 2 days of work can be spent more fully enjoying yourself and working on personal projects, since you aren't just mentally and physically recovering from the 4 days of consistent effort you just did. So in a way, you get more happy weekend and less recovery weekend\n\nTL;DR: extra day off wednesday better than friday/monday better because you work in smaller bursts and dont have spend as much time recovering from the effort you just excerted\n\nEDIT: there is a major flaw in this post, this only really applies to white collar jobs. anything to do with manual labour is at best unchanged or at worst completely ruined by this",

Case in point: not a single Nordic country has managed to get to replacement level fertility despite their heavily subsidized childcare as well as other welfare programs.\n\nThe truth is that replacement level fertility in urbanized populations can only be the result of society-wide cultural and/or economic coercion, so, for example, European countries' only choices are replacement migration or regression to a \"pro-family\" culture that would by definition stigmatize childlessness.",

  "selftext": "I’m sure you all know that the Taj Mahal is commonly used to represent India, it’s one of the most popular tourist destinations and whenever India is mentioned in movies or books or on presentations, there’s always a picture of the Taj Mahal to accompany it, however the kailasa temple and the golden temple are both better representations of India than the Taj Mahal.\n\nIf you don’t know what the kailasa temple is I suggest you look it up, it’s very impressive. The golden temple is basically the Kaaba of Sikhs, it’s the holiest place in Sikhism \n\nFirst of the kailasa is more impressive, it’s the largest monolithic structure in the world and was cut from top to bottom out of a single piece of rock in a cave, much more impressive than how the Taj Mahal was built \n\nSecond of all kailasa temple and golden temple are older, built in 773 and 1589, vs the Taj Mahal which was built in 1632, so both have more history in India than the Taj Mahal \n\nAnd finally, they both represent Indian culture better than the Taj Mahal. India is known for its for being one of the few polytheistic countries left and for its beautiful temples, so why is the symbol of India a piece of Islamic architecture from an empire known for destroying temples? Kailasha is one of the most beautiful temples in India and actually represents Indias culture and polytheistic traditions. And the golden temple is the holiest place in Indias first indigenous monotheistic religion. Sure India has other monotheistic religions like Cochin Judaism and st Thomas Christianity as well as zoroastrianism, but they all originated somewhere else and came here and absorbed culture from India. Sikhism was the first indigenous Indian monotheistic religion so the golden temple is a very significant Indian temple, and it represents India better than the Taj Mahal \n\nAlso the Taj Mahal is just a really bad representation of India, as it is a building made by Muslims, for a muslim(the kings wife), and it’s made in Islamic architecture so it’s going to connect with Muslims more than your average Indian because being made in Islamic architectural style, it’s more part of Muslim heritage than Indian heritage. Being a work of Islamic art, your average Muslim from the Middle East would probably feel a stronger connection to it than your average Indian, who is probably Hindu, Sikh, or Buddhist(for me personally I am Hindu and I feel no connection to the Taj Mahal either). \n\nAlso like I said earlier India is know for beautiful temples and also for diversity of religion and cultures, and Muslim empires(especially the Mughal empire)in India have been known for destroying temples and trying to ethnically cleanse India of non muslims so why is the symbol of a diverse country with many beautiful temples a building built by the people who constantly try to get rid of that diversity and destroy temples?\n\nAlthough the Taj Mahal is beautiful, it does not represent India as well as the kailasa temple or the golden temple, which both have a closer connection to Indian culture than the Taj Mahal and the Indian government should work to promote both the kailasa temple and the golden temple to be as popular as the Taj Mahal.",

I have progressive parents, I grew up watching movies like A League Of Their Own, Mulan, Aliens, etc\n\nIt's never made sense to me think of women as inherently inferior in anything. It's clear to me that women can do just about anything they want to do, and usually the *only* thing stopping them is sexism from men, not anything inherent about womanhood.\n\nBut I do keep wondering if the word feminist/feminism is doing more harm than good. For example, consider the word \"racist.\"\n\nThere's racists, and then there's everyone else. There's no word that means \"not a racist\" because that's the *norm.* It's how you're supposed to be. There's racists, and then there's normal people. That's it. We need a term for racists because they're strayed outside the norm.\n\nShouldn't it be the same for sexist? Right now, if you're not a sexist, it seems you have to declare feminism. As if the world is separated into sexists and feminists.\n\nBut the problem is that gives sexists a target. Now they can use language to make it seem like there is a culture war, or that both sides have some sort of equal legitimacy. Just look at how many times you can find people speaking out against perceived \"radical feminism\" or \"feminazis.\"\n\nThing is, it's a lot harder to criticize people who are simply fighting against sexism. But if they're fighting *for feminism*, then people can twist their motives and lie to the gullible that they're trying to promote women to be above the status of men.\n\nIt's like, fighting against sexism is fighting for equality, but it's too easy for sexists lacking self-awareness to perceive fighting for feminism as just fighting for women, at the expense of men.\n\nIt's similar to how right-wingers had to start campaigning against \"woke.\" As far as I can tell, \"woke\" just means tolerance. You can't gain public support if you're fighting against tolerance, but if \"woke\" is just some nebulous thing that left-wingers do, you can proudly declare yourself \"anti-woke\" and gain support from small-minded people who just aren't noticing that what you're really fighting for is anti-tolerance.\n\nI think the same thing has been happening with feminism. It's a lot easier to fight against feminism than it is to fight *for sexism* which is what the sexists are actually doing, by using propaganda to make people view feminism as something radical and, ironically, sexist. \n\nWhich has never been the objective of feminism, aka trying to dismantle sexism.\n\nDoes any of this make sense? Should it just be sexism versus normal people, or are there benefits to creating the feminism label?",

Ok Israel has Arabs living in it, it has Druze, Christians, Armenians all classified as Arabs but these people didn’t just immigrate to Israel and Israel allowed them in, they were there and became Israeli citizens. \n\n“Israel has Beta Israelis aka Black Hebrews and they number around 5,000”. This is true but again they claim to be Jewish. Israel is not asking for gentiles to come to live in Israel, they want Jewish people (primarily)\n\n“Israel is suppose to be the safe haven for Jews of course we have to let them in!” That sounds nice and I agree with it but it makes the water muddy when you realize they’d much rather let in criminal jewish people in than a good samaritan French gentile or other nationality.\n\n\n Israel doesn’t even deny that it is basically a Jewish state albeit secular and democratic so why the denial? And yes I’ve heard it all before: Ireland has law of return and so do essentially all non-Americas (north and south) countries but Israel’s policies clearly are more reflective of the idea of a save haven for Jews rather than explicitly a Jewish state like say Ireland is an Irish state, Mexico is a Mexican state etc. \n\n \n\nWhere there to be Two Jewish states this entire argument would go down the drain and antisemitism would drastically decrease.\n\n\n  **And yes I will stand by the singular Hispanic nation analogy to Israel as it is essentially the best analogy I can think of to Israel’s immigration policy: Not so much about literal race so much as ethnicity, Hispanics of all background (approximately 15 million of them) living in one nation roughly the size of Costa Rica, they share ancestral ties to Spain, were mixed in with other population (Indigenous, African or both) and would be categorized by race in this place “Spanish european Latinos”, “Indigenous Latinos” “Mestizo Latinos” “Mulatto Latinos” etc. But they’d all be Latino, akin to Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Beta Israelites, Ashkenazi Jews etc. yes I know its more complex with Jewish people but its about the best analogy I can give**",

I do not mean patients should be forced to choose therapy, but I do mean that it should be the default.\n\nReasoning:\n\n1) The physical side effects of medication are always a risk and can sometimes be severe. Meanwhile therapy should not have any physical effects.\n\n2) For many of the most common disorders for which antidepressants are prescribed, therapy works just as well or can even have a higher success rate. For instance, cognitive behavioral therapy has approximately equivalent success rates for anxiety and depression, and exposure therapy has higher success rates for OCD.\n\n3) Medication can have withdrawal or return of symptoms when you stop taking it. The ideal should not be to stay on medication forever if possible. In that sense, it is also more economically viable to do therapy, considering that you may be able to stop after a few years.\n\n4) In some cases, taking antidepressants can have _permanent_ side effects. Such as PSSD.\n\nEdit: to clarify, I'm not saying that taking medication before therapy should be banned,merely that it should not be the default or standard.\n\nEdit 2: A lot of people are bringing up the cost of therapy. That is why I mentioned that it should be an insurance priority as well. I also think that if therapy isn't prioritized, there would be less motivation to fund therapy and for people to become therapists, which could just compound the problem.\n\nEdit 3: Y'all I'M NOT SAYING TO COMPLETELY FORGO MEDICATION, but rather that the initial recommendation should be to try therapy. And _then_ if it doesn't work, is insufficient, or if the patient expresses concerns for whatever reason, _then_ medication can be discussed. My issue is the order of operations that this is often done, not the use of medication altogether. ",

  "selftext": "It is my general view that the US should withdraw the majority of its military forces and funding from the Middle East. I think the current policy is neither in the US' strategic interest (it's an expensive deployment in a region that is far less important to the US than Europe, Asia, or the Americas) nor morally praiseworthy (the majority of people in the region do not want our forces there). \n\nHowever, I think there is a bit of an implementation issue in carrying this view out. I don't think the US should simply abandon the various Middle Eastern allies we've promised to protect, from either a strategic perspective (it's terrible for credibility) or a moral one (it will lead to a lot of deaths).\n\nSo I think the US should make Middle Eastern countries the following offer. The US will protect them with bases, ships, soldiers, security aid funding, and ultimately a treaty alliance if and only if they (a) match US sanctions and trade policy (e.g., copy all our sanctions and trade restrictions on Iran, Russia, China, and any other countries we choose), (b) maintain a human rights baseline along the lines of \"no killing or arbitrarily imprisoning their own people\", and possibly (c) agree to help the US in any future conflict in the region (this one can be negotiable). Currently none of the countries the US is guaranteeing the security of in the Middle East meet (a) and few of them meet (b). That should not be allowed to stand - it's a wild degree of free riding and disloyalty from states we are protecting and do not actually need as allies.\n\nIf none of the states in the Middle East want to take this deal, fine, we can withdraw all our forces and aid from the region. Lives and money saved. If some of them do, great - we've gained allies considerably more useful than the ones we have currently. \n\nSome arguments I have considered:\n\n* The US needs oil from the Middle East. It really doesn't. The US is a net oil exporter. What US presidential administrations do want (largely for silly reasons relating to the domestic political importance of consumer gasoline prices) is for global gasoline prices to remain stable. But this can be achieved in lots of ways besides current US Middle East policy, and I'm frankly skeptical that current US Middle East policy is even keeping global gasoline prices stable.\n\n* These countries will all pick a new patron (China, Russia, Iran) if America is less of an obliging sugar daddy. I suspect the new patron will find dealing with the various infighting countries of the Middle East as unrewarding as America has. The odds that this results in a dangerous unified alliance of Middle Eastern countries capable of making trouble for America outside the Middle East strike me as low.\n\n* America should protect all countries’ sovereignty with force of arms regardless of what they do for it. I don’t think this is feasible for the US, and it’s not a role the rest of the world has asked for.\n\n* The US should just leave the area entirely. I think abandoning places we promised to protect is not a wise or just way to handle things. If Bahrain or wherever was immediately conquered once we withdrew our forces, quite apart from the hit to US credibility, that would be a tragic harm to its people we could have prevented.",

And I appreciate many aspects of this film. \n\nI also want to add that I have a strong desire for cinema to be great again (MCGA) … I’m talking about actual cinema… not pornography (in case you’re trying to conflate my profession with my point) \n\n——\n\nThank God there is more to art than the current marvel universe.\n\nTruly, I’m am ever grateful that something other than what we’ve been served for decades, is relevant.\n\nHowever, this movie reminds me of my day to day life so much, that I can’t tell if it is good or bad. \n\nMy current “main source of income” consists of looking at extremely wide angle lenses, and sex acts.\n\nWhich is what the majority of this movie is.\n\nThis movie, to me, is just my everyday job with a bigger budget and you kind of tell all departments to do whatever the fuck they want.\n\nI guess I’ll question what I always question while working… is the script I’ve been provided with worth the effort of making something good? or just winging it.\n\nAnd here’s the thing: I think the script is phenomenal. But, as I said, I feel like this is just what happens if you tell all departments to do what the fuck ever.\n\nJust…. Tell me why it’s good. Please!",

There are certainly other examples of this where bills just end up dying for no other reason than the speaker just not calling a vote. This tactic restricts voters from being able to make conscientious decisions on who to vote for based on what their representative votes for, it muzzles public sentiment and greatly restricts representatives' ability to do their job. One person should not have the ability to do this and it eliminates one of the founding principles of the US government, which is checks and balances. Sure there is the option to oust the speaker if there is a majority opposition, but only on rare occasions does that happen.

  "selftext": "It is commonly agreed that denying a child food or medical care constitutes child abuse, because of the adverse impacts on the child's health, physical and emotional development, and wellbeing. We have reached this conclusion based on numerous long term research studies that have demonstrated the adverse impacts of these practices. Drinking while pregnant with your child is similarly considered a form of child abuse, because of its negative effects on child development.\n\nHowever, despite decades of scientific research and an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that spanking or corporal punishment in children creates a host of adverse effects on the child, we still accept that parents have the right to punish their children in this manner.\n\n**What does the research say?**\n\n* A landmark meta-analysis published in 2002 showed that **of** **27 studies on physical punishment and child aggression,** **all found a significant positive relation,** regardless of the size of the sample, location of study, ages of the children or any other variable. (Gershoff ET. Corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and experiences: a meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychol Bull 2002;128:539–79)\n* Physical punishment is **associated with a range of mental health problems in children, youth and adults, including depression, unhappiness, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, use of drugs and alcohol,** and general psychological maladjustment. (Turner HA, Muller PA. Long-term effects of child corporal punishment on depressive symptoms in young adults: potential moderators and mediators. J Fam Issues 2004;25:761–82)\n* Intriguing results are now emerging from neuroimaging studies, which suggest that **physical punishment may reduce the volume of the brain’s grey matter** in areas associated with performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III). (Tomoda A, Suzuki H, Rabi K, et al. Reduced prefrontal cortical gray matter volume in young adults exposed to harsh corporal punishment. Neuroimage 2009;47:T66–71)\n* Physical punishment can cause **alterations in the dopaminergic regions associated with vulnerability to the abuse of drugs and alcohol.** (Sheu Y-S, Polcan A, Anderson CM, et al. Harsh corporal punishment is associated with increased T2 relaxation time in dopamine-rich regions. Neuroimage 2010;53:412–9)\n* Researchers are also finding that **physical punishment is linked to slower cognitive development and adversely affects academic achievement.** (Straus MA, Paschall MJ. Corporal punishment by mothers and development of children’s cognitive ability: a longitudinal study of two nationally representative age cohorts. J Aggress Maltreat Trauma 2000;18:459–83)\n\nSimilarly, research has demonstrated that there is a high correlation between spanking and serious physical abuse.  A large Canadian study found that *children who were spanked by their parents were seven times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents* (e.g., punched or kicked) than children who were not spanked. In an American study, *infants in their first year of life who had been spanked by their parents in the previous month were 2.3 times more likely to suffer an injury requiring medical attention* than infants who had not been spanked. (Crandall M, Chiu B, Sheehan K. Injury in the first year of life: risk factors and solutions for high-risk families. J Surg Res 2006; 133:7–10)\n\nThis indicates to me that allowing corporal punishment opens the door for other forms of more severe physical violence.\n\n**To me it's simple: parents have no right to permanently damage their child's brain, whether that's drinking while pregnant or hitting it after it's born. Any action which permanently harms a child's brain development is a form of child abuse that requires intervention. And anyone who spanks their child is a bad parent.** ",

  "selftext": "First. I don't think it's debatable that U.S. Universities are way more left than the average U.S. citizen or even the average university member internationally. Data from his think tank.

Now try to understand why is that.\n\nIn recent months, I have become a reader of the Richard Hanania's Newsletter. I generally disagree with him in most stuff (I'm liberal, he's conservative), but I generally like his descriptions of how the world works, particularly with regards to universities.\n\nHere's a brief summary by ChatGPT of [Why Everything is Liberal](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/why-is-everything-liberal):\n\n>Hanania's argument delves into the phenomenon of \"Woke Capital\" and the apparent political leanings of major American institutions towards liberal positions, despite a near-even split in national political preference. He suggests that the difference in influence between conservatives and liberals isn't due to the number of votes each side garners but rather the level of engagement and intensity (cardinal utility) with which liberals pursue their political objectives. Liberals, he argues, are more likely to donate, protest, and engage in other forms of political activism, thereby exerting a disproportionate influence on institutions outside of election cycles. This engagement results in institutions and professional fields appearing to lean left, reflecting the preferences of the more politically active liberal minority rather than the electoral parity between conservative and liberal voters. Hanania explores various facets of this dynamic, including donor patterns, protest participation, and ideological representation in academia and the media, to illustrate why institutions might align with liberal preferences despite a divided electorate.\n\nA second explanation of his generally comes from the excellent text [Liberals read, conservatives watcH TV](https://www.richardhanania.com/p/liberals-read-conservatives-watch). Again from ChatGPT:\n\n>Richard Hanania's post explores the ideological divide between conservatives and liberals in American politics, attributing the effectiveness and dominance of liberal agendas to the intellectual and written-word culture within liberal circles, contrasted with the more visceral, television-based culture of conservatives. He argues that liberals, driven by a deeper engagement with ideas and a willingness to push boundaries, influence institutions and policy more effectively than conservatives, who focus more on tribal loyalty and personality-driven politics. This dynamic allows liberals to shape public opinion and policy over time, even if it costs them short-term electoral success, while conservatives struggle to make lasting ideological impacts despite occasional electoral victories. Hanania suggests that this difference in approach explains why liberal positions tend to advance in society and institutions, despite a roughly even political divide in the electorate.\n\nIn recent podcast episodes, Hanania has radicalized his position even more and he thinks that most smart people are liberal and he is very concerned with the ability of Republicans to fill positions in future administrations given the brain drain they are suffering since 2016.\n\nTherefore, a possible two-pronged explanation of why U.S. universities are so leftist is:\n\n1. Most smart people tend to be liberal, and universities are populated with smart people\n2. University isn't the best paying job, so you tend to attract people that are motivated by ideas and prestige rather than money. E.g.: You attract the optimist kid who will make a PhD in economics to help make the world better rather than going to work in Wall Street.\n\n**Obviously, this is one explanation, and you aren't bound by Hanania's or anyone else's view of the world. You can try changing my mind by suggesting a third model to be the** ***main*** **one.**\n\nMy argument is that the opportunity cost for Americans to pursue PhDs is very high. The U.S. have much longer PhD timelines than most places in the world, some people graduating after 7 years. And if you're out of a top 30 university, exactly the ones we're, you can get better jobs on corporate America that often pay 3-5x more than you'd get from a stipend during PhD. Even after PhD, it isn't obvious you're set for life, you may need still a post-doc, so it's an almost a decade of below-average income.\n\nBut if you're a foreigner this works nice. 1- This is one of the best immigration path. 2- If you're Indian, Latino, Chinese, and so on, the stipend creates a better quality of life than you'd get on your home country. [According to the NSF, 56% of PhD students are foreign-born in the U.S.](https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/sei/one-pagers/Foreign-Born.pdf)\n\nIt is very hard to be conservative in the U.S. if you're foreign born, particularly if you're not a U.S. citizen! But PhD students and mostly later when they become professors and researchers, they have an outstanding ability to shape public discourse. And they use it! If now you're in the democrat big tent, you end up getting the other stuff from the liberal/leftist world-view. \n\n**A corollary is that Republicans would benefit a lot if they were to soft their instance on immigration of highly educated individuals. If F-2/J-2 visa were better for family members, you had easier paths to H1-Bs and green cards as a PhD student, and so on, they'd have much less of a key issue to join the democrat tent.** Obviously, I don't think they'd suddenly become conservative, lol, but maybe you get PhD lib to conservative proportion back to 5x, 4x, and unis would make a bit less opposition to republicans. You can too try to change my mind on this one.\n\nEDIT: Lots of people are pushing back saying that most undergrad students are white or U.S. Born. This is obvious. But please, note that I added official data that 56% of U.S. PhD students are foreign-born. The unspoken part that may be causing confusion is that I'm assuming that University culture is created by staff. Therefore the ideology that undergrad students depends on professors. And professors make PhDs. Therefore, studying what happens during PhD programs is helpful to understand universities. You may disagree with this assumption.",

  "selftext": "A common thing that I keep hearing Americans say is that \"The USA is the great promoter of democracy\" or something along those lines. It usually assumes that democracy is more moral than authoritarianism (which I agree with to a certain extant), therefore the USA's foreign policy is broadly moral.\n\nBut that's just not true.\n\nAmerica allies with undemocratic states all the time, most notably Egypt and Saudi Arabia today, but also in the past. South Korea and Taiwan were dictatorships until 1987. Pakistan has shifted between democracy and military rule numerous times. The USA has often directly propped up dictators in other places as well like South Vietnam and Indonesia to secure their economic interests. Sometimes they even toppled governments that were elected democratically or were in favour of democracy, like in Iran and countless times in Latin America.\n\nThis pattern in foreign policy cannot be explained by the USA's willingness to protect democracy, but its willingness to secure its own economic interest. Egypt controls the Suez Canal and Saudi Arabia controls the oil supply. The USA must work with these authoritarian countries to ensure control over its own economic interests. \n\nCan someone please explain to me how so many Americans believe that the USA is the bastion of democracy? I would like to hear examples of the USA pursuing actively democracy in another country despite taking a potentially big hit to its own economy.",

  "selftext": "I have extended relatives living in a country that has historically been enemies with the United States, and is now a large trading partner of the US (China). My relatives used to work on impoverished farms within plots of land handed by the government, but now thanks to the gradual opening of the economy starting in 1978 along with investments from the United States, my families are now living better lives than ever (even with some current economic difficulties).Much of this growth I believe, could be attributed to the integrated world economy to which the United States is the current steward of, and has been since 1992 (maybe even before the USSR collapse). By being able to participate in this global economy, many countries can grow their economies, receive investments, and thus better the lives of their citizens.\n\nThe problem starts when the United States has the de facto economic leverage to sanction any countries who’s ruling ideology the United States disagrees with. This happened with Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, Russia, and some other countries. By cutting these investments and trade opportunities off, these countries are essentially left to fend for themselves in a dying economy while ordinary citizens suffer. If the United States were to sanction China, many of my relatives will have to endure worse lives just because the United States hates the government. Sanctions do nothing except to galvanize the population towards the regimes that the United States is against. It can’t force a regime change since the governments can simply find an alternative source of income.\n\nIn contrast, if we have multiple blocs of superpowers in this world, no single bloc could completely cripple the economy of any nation they disagree with. They could simply diversify their economies like any good investor and maintain their ruling governments and way of life without being blackmailed by one superpower.",

It’s entirely likely that Hispanics may become America’s largest ethnic group in about 100 years. We had a black president with Obama so it’s not like we’ve been 100% whitey in the 21st century with presidents. If they speak fluent Spanish, a Hispanic president would be great for foreign relations with Latin America, Spain and negotiating immigration issues.\n\nHowever, my gut feeling is that we probably won’t get a Hispanic president for a while. People are super into identity politics nowadays but our two most likely presidential nominees are two old white guys that belong in a retirement home, not the White House. The closest we have gotten recently was probably in 2016 with Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, with Ted Cruz arguably being more white than Hispanic in both a literal, linguistic and cultural sense. There’s also the issue that there doesn’t appear to be anyone in either the Republican or Democratic Party that is considered to be a successor to Trump or Biden within the wings ready to take over. A decent amount of Hispanics are ineligible to vote and a lot of the more active voters are old people who are usually white but can also be black. The potential of the border closing in a literal and metaphorical sense due to a 2nd Donald Trump policy could decrease the growth of the Hispanic population and decrease the likelihood a Hispanic person will secure the presidential nomination soon.",

  "selftext": "This CMV is about the US healthcare system.\n\nRight now hospitals negotiate with every single insurance company for how much they will charge for different treatments. This is inefficient for the following reasons:\n\n1. Every hospital needs an army of bureaucrats to do the negotiations.  \n2. Every insurer needs an army of bureaucrats to do the negotiations.  \n3. Doctors are unable to compare prices. Remembering prices for hundreds to thousands of treatments is hard enough for doctors. When multiplied by the number of insurance companies, this is an impossible task. This leads to doctors choosing more expensive treatments than necessary, increasing the cost of healthcare.\n\nNow, I think I understand why the current system emerged: For each insurance company it is in their interest to negotiate a lower price because this saves them (and consequently their insurees via lower premiums) money. But when every insurance company starts doing so it just raises the costs for everyone.\n\nGovernments are *the* tool to solve these collective action problems. Thus, I propose a nationwide law to force insurance companies to stop negotiating for lower prices. The simplest law that I think would work would be to require each hospitals to charge the same amount for each treatment to every insurance company.\n\nNote that the law I am thinking about *does not* say that hospitals have to charge the same amount to insured people as uninsured people. I think hospitals should be allowed to price discriminate based on lack of insurance: If uninsured people are less likely to pay their bills (e.g. because they go bankrupt), the hospital needs to charge them more to recoup their losses. But insured people have the backing of a large, highly regulated insurance company behind them. Their insurance company will not go bankrupt.\n\nOne place this gets thorny is when insurance companies refuse to pay hospital bills, either because they deem the treatment \"experimental\" or \"not necessary\" or because the patient has a copay. This would lead to some insurance companies paying less than they ought to and thus having lower premiums--at the cost of the hospital and patient. I think this could be avoided by creating a second law holding insurance companies financially responsible for *all* treatments that occur (holding hospitals/doctors/patients criminally responsible for fraud/malpractice if they actually do perform unnecessary treatments, and letting the insurance company sue their insuree if they don't pay their copayment), but that is the topic of another CMV.\n\nThe main way you can change my view is if there is some negative consequence of requiring this that I do not currently foresee.\n\nEDIT: Please do not mention anything about universal healthcare. That is not what this CMV is about. This CMV is about whether this one *particular* law I'm proposing would be an incremental improvement to the current system.",

  "selftext": "I'm referring to the California woman who stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after consuming cannabis and only sentenced last month to 100 days of community service.\n\nThis case reminds me of Sarah Halimi's one in France where an elderly lady got thrown off a window by a man who had just taken cannabis before his rampage and was considered not criminally responsible penally.\n\nAlthough, contrarily to that other murder I do think that Bryn was indeed in a serious state of psychosis as she not only stabbed her boyfriend but her dog, and herself. And when the police intervened, even taser and baton strikes were not very effective at stopping her.\n\nThat being said I do believe that the sentence she received was highly problematic (way too low) for these 4 reasons:\n\n* Even if marijuana frenzies can potentially happen on rare occasions, I just don't believe a mentally stable person could reach such violence with only marijuana. This led me to believe that she either consumed other additional substances or that she has some sort of mental instability that can lead her to become violent in some instances. And if that second hypothesis is true, then she needs psychiatric treatment (which was the decision for Sarah Halimi's murderer)\n* Maybe the most important of my 4 points: Her not being aware during the killing doesn't mean she isn't responsible for it. The fact that she willingly decided to take psychotropic drugs that could potentially cloud her judgment meant she was responsible for putting herself in that state. Correct me if I'm wrong but if a person after consuming alcohol becomes violent and attacks others, he will be convicted. Removing all responsibility for marijuana sounds like encouragement for murderers to use this excuse and be cleared of charges.\n* Receiving only 100 days of community service after brutally killing someone is shameful and a total disrespect for the deceased and his family. It just isn't right.\n* Let's not fool ourselves, she only got this miraculous judgment because she was an upper-class white woman. If it was a man, poor or of color that sentencing would have been different.\n\nAnd for these 4 reasons are believe that Bryn judgment was not only unfair but dangerous.\n\nCorrection: It's not 100 days but 100 hours of community service which is even worse than what I thought...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate: This post blew out much more than what I initially thought and it became a bit overwhelming to get every response. But I did change my mind about some point:\n\nWhile I never doubted the marijuana frenzy I wrongly assumed that it was because she either took it with other drugs or had mental antecedent. After reading a bunch of articles on that subject it seems that there is indeed a link between psychosis and marijuana even though it is still not well understood and can happen without any signs prior. As for the Sarah Halimi case, the murderer had clear psychiatric deficiencies, which is not the case of Bryn Spejcher. So we can't really compare the two.\n\nHere is my update for my four points:\n\n1. Bryn Spejcher does not have psychiatric antecedents but it seems that this kind of psychosis can lead to severe mental illness. And often a long follow-up period is needed to identify them. More on that in this [article](https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.ajp.2017.17020223). While internment is too much, she should at least have had psychiatric monitoring.\n2. A lot of comments told me that she was coerced to take the drug by her boyfriend. But the reports are not that clear and at this point, I can't really choose between giving her right or wrong, the trial already happened anyway. So I will give a general thought on that sort of case: If she chooses to take the drug, she is responsible. Even if it's strongly mitigated by the extreme nature of the reaction. She is an adult, who chooses to take substances that mess with her faculty, and knew at least that considering that she had taken marijuana seven times before that incident. I'm not gonna give you what sentences she should have because that is not my field (which is also the case of 99% of the redditor here) but I do think she should have received at least something.\n3. This point was totally subjective so I didn't expect it to change anyway. The mother killed herself two years after the killing of her son, so I can only imagine how disgusted the father was at the announcement of the verdict (he was indeed pretty unhappy).\n4. That one still stands too and it seems most of you agreed with the fact that a POC would have been more severely punished. And I reiterate that a man would also have much more chance to be given prison time if in the shoes of Bryn Spejcher.\n\nDo I still think Bryn Spejcher's sentence was ridiculous  Yes, I do. manslaughter is still manslaughter. But to be clear I do not hate her. What happened is a tragedy and I'm sad, not only for her boyfriend and his family but for her too to some extent.",

  "selftext": "Many seem to treat these two things as special, somehow demanding special treatment different from all other things in certain contexts, I don't see why.\n\nI often use my view as an argument to challenge many views here and never really got a compelling answer back. But for instance, there are often views which argue that prostitution should be illegal with the argument that many prostitutes are only prositutes for the money, not because they truly enjoy the work, to which then invariably about 50 people reply with that that's the same for about any profession. Typically the original poster then claims that sex work is different, sometimes with the argument that it carries certain dangers, and then people again point out that many other lines of work are also dangerous and then the conversation typically stops.\n\nThere are many other examples such as sex crimes being treated as especially uniquely by many individuals who want a special case in defamation laws for being accused of one, “rape shield laws” to exist, an “sex offender registries” which exist for no other crimes.\n\nOr for instance people who require that the sex of the protagonist of a work of fiction be their own to find it enjoyable to find the protagonist “relatable”. In which case others typically respond with that they're already say, 25 year old Mexicans who are watching a teenage Japanese protagonist who on top of that lives in a world where people regularly have magical powers so it should be so far removed from themselves that sex is a drop in the bucket. Then they will sometimes say that sex makes more of a differece in relatability than the country one is born and raised in. And then I will simply say that that is silly. A Mexican conversing with a Japanese person will typically not even have a language in common, and if we can ignore that, there will be many culture shocks. I have never heard of males and females living in the same country having grown up together and attended the same primary school classes having culture shocks talking to each other. Perhaps this would happen in a culture where sexes live completely segregated from one another but at the end male and female Mexicans and Japanese persons mingle with each other and go to school and work together while Mexicans and Japanese persons live apart from each other with a giant pacific ocean between them for the most part.\n\nIn all these cases when I offered these challenges I was the one challenging others and they typically elected not to respond or ignore it, and I might add sometimes in a very aggressive tone as though they felt very confronted but now, others are challenging me so I can hopefully get a response.",

  "selftext": "Now I'll (24M) admit, I wanted to refrain from posting here for a while after my last post, where I am admittedly grateful for some of the people who backed me up against those who attacked me for expressing my genuine views on this topic. \n\nBut what made me want to post here again was this. I logged back onto Facebook after a year and a half, and the first thing that I see on it was the fact that someone who I went to school with who's only a year older than myself posted a pic that he was expecting his first child in August. And to say that it made me devoid of any feeling is an understatement. Now this guy, unlike many others, isn't someone I resent even though he was a sporty guy, cause he was at least a semi-decent person, but it just makes me quiver in fear at the prospect of many others that I didn't see on Facebook doing better than me in this main aspect.\n\nNevertheless, I feel like this post really reinforced something that I felt the need to address for the longest time, and that is the fact that I'm starting to really believe that dating/finding love/getting married is mostly about luck and not effort. \n\nHere's why I say that, in no particular order. \n\n1. I live in Toronto, Canada, literally one of the worst cities in the world to make lifelong connections outside of childhood (which of course I missed).\n2. I've actually tried to \"put myself out there\" and \"work on myself\" to develop a \"social circle\". Beyond the usual school, I've joined clubs, taken classes,  (dance, photography, improv etc.), asked my existing connections if they knew people they could connect me with, and guess what? All led to absolutely nothing. With regards to classes I've joined, most of  the time, the people there are significantly older than me and quite frankly wasting both my time and theirs with their attendance. In terms of clubs, if they aren't sausage fests, a lot of them just simply have no consistency in the people that show up, so no chance for the \"repeated unplanned social interaction blah blah blah\" stuff that \"experts\" preach about. \n3. Going off of the \"mutual\" introduction, if said mutual connections aren't losers like myself who don't know people they could introduce me to, they simply are people who for whatever, reason never think of or never follow up on introducing me to others, even when I ask them and explain my situation in the politest way possible.\n4. Even in the most optimal situation of all, it still didn't work out. I am literally the only male in my master's cohort of 15 people, and yet pretty much every woman that I thought interesting to connect with are either in relationships or simply incompatible with me (due to them being religious). If I couldn't find someone even in the most supposedly optimal situation, then that means I'm practically screwed for the future.\n5. Some other necessary information that I feel reinforces this point and also a reminder for those who may not have been following. I'm mildly autistic, 5'6.5\", Iranian descent, balding, slightly above average weight. So you can probably imagine that online dating is a shitshow for someone like myself, which is why I vowed to never succumb to that BS ever again, but even meeting people IRL is practically a nightmare given the aforementioned points.\n6. The only reason I even got my first kiss back in December was due to sheer, dumb luck. I met that woman on an outdoor club camping trip, but what I did was practically no different than what I did (or wished to do other times), it's just that... well... the circumstances worked out. She was someone I was into, she was single, and she wasn't a jerk like many others who brushed me off for being different and introverted. Even if it took 16 months for us to really get intimate, that just seems to further go against all the people that put me down constantly. \n7. I have a friend who got married to her husband after 8 years together, but that situation is literally the epitome of luck. They met in the first day of their university tutorials, and somehow, she, unlike many others, wasn't repulsed by him being friendless for most of his life, and actually took the initiative to connect with him. Had they gone to uni during COVID times, he never would never have met her, and would never have gotten married.\n8. It seems like in the current world, there are practically no opportunities for people to meet organically anymore outside of either mutual friends or online dating, and given that neither option works out for me no matter what I do, it seems to only reinforce my view that my situation is mostly luck at this point. \n\nI could name MANY other points, but I think these are the best ones I could say regarding my current viewpoint and what led me to post it. And trust me, I'm not excited for them, but I definitely am expecting a bunch of enlightened platitudes such as \"if it smells like crap everywhere blah blah blah\" or \"everyone goes at their own pace\". It would be much appreciated if you guys took the time to really consider my viewpoint and what I have done to improve my situation, which is a lot more than can be said for many people on the spectrum and even not on the spectrum. And for the record, for those who may not have been following, I am currently on my 12th therapist in 9.5 years given how practically all of them have been garbage in helping me through these issues, and some of whom even reinforced my feelings of bitterness.",

  "selftext": "There is a crisis at the southern border of the United States, but many nativists have been describing immigration as a de-stabilizing force for centuries, and the most powerful rhetoric advocating for nativism engages with racist paranoia rather than genuine financial concerns. Now that a crisis of immigration poses serious economic and humanitarian problems, the liberal government has mostly abdicated on responsibly handling it, and the reason is not because they hate America or are so anti-racist or humanitarian that they can’t see the damage of their policies. It’s because the policies advocated by the conservative opposition will “solve” the problem through a strategy based on racist paranoia rather than on economic concerns. (e.g. There are many policies that could reduce the downward effect of immigrant labor on wages, but many Republican politicians as well as conservative media outlets insist on a policy of force.)\n\nIn our political system that encourages factionalism instead of serious efforts to develop solutions, it is impossible to address this crisis, and it is mostly the fault of nativists for poisoning the well of discussion for the last 200 years.\n\nI also know that my claim that Republican plans to address immigration through forceful border security measures ignore other ways to mitigate the downward effect on the price of labor that an influx of low-skill workers causes will get some push back. I should list some specific examples of this.\n\n* The fear of immigrants of being caught is a part of why they accept being paid such low wages. Criminalizing immigration further will encourage this problem.\n* Trade unions drive up the price of labor, and yet Republican leaders consistently appoint officers to the government who are hostile to organized labor.\n* Republican Governors and voters like sending immigrants to sanctuary cities where they know the local economies will not be able to support the influx of people. However, there are many parts of the country that do not have shortages of space/shelter *and* that have shortages of labor where immigrant labor would be very valuable.\n* Strengthening the regulatory state would reduce the scale of the exploitation of migrant labor that steals jobs from native-born Americans.",

  "selftext": "Genuinely curious because as a beer and bourbon-lover, I just can’t for the life of me understand NA drinks, and I really want to. Why do people drink them? (Obviously I’m not talking about people who are sober. My brother is in recovery, so I know how important it is to have alternatives for sober people. I’m asking why non-sober people are obsessing over NA.)\n\nIt can’t be about the calories, because there isn’t a caloric difference and there’s low cal beer anyways.\n\nI don’t buy the “social buy-in” argument, as in someone doesn’t want to get drunk but they want to fit in with their friends who are drinking so they grab a NA beer. We are adults, outside of college no one cares what you’re drinking.\n\nI hear people say “I want to drink without getting drunk.” This is the main one I don’t understand. I find it hard to believe that someone likes the taste of beer so much that they want to drink it without the warning alcohol feeling. I’m obsessed with the process, flavor, and art of brewing beer and distilling whiskey. And I certainly don’t drink a lot, maybe 3-5 drinks per week? But I wouldn’t drink them if the warming, comforting embrace from the alcohol wasn’t also a part of the experience. What’s the point? Drinks are nothing without the alcohol in them, even if you’re not getting drunk. Even if I take just 1 sip of whiskey, I sure as hell hope it will have that warming alcohol feeling, or else the sip is lacking something. At the very least it requires a “sting” to taste right. \n\nAnd if you just want something without alcohol in it, you can get something way better than a NA beer or a mocktail. Water, seltzer, coke, any other soda, sherry temple, juice, coffee, energy drinks, any other bottled/canned drink, etc.\n\nWhat am I missing?\n\nIs the thing I’m missing just that some people genuinely love the flavor of NA drinks without the alcohol in it? If so, please explain that because it’s fascinating to me.\n\nOr is there no real explanation and it’s just a trend that makes no sense at the end of the day? Like people who don’t have Celiac disease eating no gluten? They just do it to do it.\n\nEdit 1: I think people are misunderstanding what I said about the taste. I’m not saying I don’t like the taste of beer/alcohol. I love the taste! What I’m saying is that I see the alcohol as an ingredient (I know it’s not actually an ingredient). No different than hops, citrus, or wheat. If you were handed an IPA with no hops, it would be weird? Right? And it’s not because I’m an alcoholic lol. It’s like a cookie with no sugar. Is it still a cookie? Sure. Would I ever pick it over a normal cookie? No. Because the sugar is an important part. Does that mean I’m addicted to sugar? Does that mean I eat too much sugar? Does that mean I have a sugar problem? No. It means I recognize the cookie as incomplete without an important ingredient.\n\nEdit 2: Never in my adult life have I seen or experienced peer pressure to drink. I go out with friends almost every weekend, and I often do “dry” months for the hell of it. And no one has ever said anything. In college when immaturity is rampant? Of course. But not as an adult. But it sounds like people actually do judge others for not drinking and make them feel uncomfortable for it. I had no idea. I can’t fathom that, but if you say it happens, I guess it happens. Sorry I can’t give deltas to everyone who said this. ",

And I'm just honestly surprised that people care so much about it.\n\nSo here's my interpretation of it: underneath all the arguments about how it impacts relationship stability, your chances of finding a good partner later in life, what it says about your morals, and so on, is an undercurrent of plain old jealousy and resentment. Most guys actually dream they could get to the sort of numbers attractive women get and because they can't, they get resentful and lash out.

  "selftext": "Baseball would be better if the innings were structured in a more \"king of the hill\" type format. \n\nPlay begins like normal, with the teams tied, alternating hitting and pitching. Until one team takes a lead. Next inning when the trailing team comes to bat, if they're unable to surmount the lead in that inning, then they would go on to be the hitting team in the following inning as well. And this would continue until they surmount the lead, or until they've exhausted all 9 of their innings and they lose.\n\nWhy is this better?\n\nBecause it is more involving and suspenseful to watch a trailing team hit than a leading team. \n\n- If you are cheering for the trailing team then you want to watch them bat and regain their lead. You don't want to watch them pitch and maybe keep it close or let the game fall further out of reach.\n- If you are cheering for the leading team you want your team to defend its lead and induce an ending to the game. It's scary when your team is pitching, but also very exciting every out that is made. You don't mind watching your team hit, but added runs don't feel nearly as good as those runs that flip the game in your team's favor.\n\nKotH approach would make the average inning much more interesting to be involved in as a player, manager, or spectator.\n\nAlso there wouldn't be as much opportunity to run up the score, so ridiculous blow out games where nobody cares by the end would be much less frequent.\n\nThis could be taxing on pitchers, pitching multiple half-innings back to back, but it's a self-balancing problem. They get tired, pitch worse, give up the lead, then their team gets to bat and the pitcher gets a rest. Long breaks would also be outside the norm for how baseball is currently played, but I believe approaches to pitching could easily adapt.\n\nPerhaps the main downside is that some would consider themselves cheated if they don't get to play or spectate 17-18 innings for a game. I wouldn't though.\n\n\n\nEdit: Each team gets 9 innings to bat to recapture the lead. If the trailing team captures the lead in the 9th and the leading team has only hit in 1 inning so far, they would get 8 more innings to recapture the lead for the win.",

  "selftext": "I've been thinking about economics lately and have come to the above conclusion. I think people tend to think about economics from an individual level because that's what they experience day to day, but they fail to understand how the economy works on a broader scale. Imagine you have a perfectly equal and happy society of 100 people who all have the same wealth/income. You then randomly give 10 of those people $1 billion. They put it in a bank account but don't spend it. Your equal society has suddenly become very unequal, but has anything in the economy changed? Of course not. The change only happens if those 10 people go to use their $1 billion, they'd price the other 90 people out of resources and drive up prices and inflation.\n\nA common argument I hear all the time is \"the rich harm the economy by hoarding money. If only they spent it, it would go back into the economy and benefit everyone\", but if that was the case why wait for the rich to do it? Why doesn't the government just print more money and spend it themselves? What's the difference between Elon Musk spending $100 million on a yacht and the government printing and spending $100 million on a new school? They would create the same number of jobs and economic stimulus, but in one scenario a billionaire gets a yacht and in the other a community gets a school. I know which one I'd rather have.\n\nWhy does this distinction matter? Because if it's true, then there's no point in fixating on or trying to tax net worth. We should be focused on the extravagant and frivolous consumption of the rich--that's when they damage the economy by driving up prices and swapping out their hoard of fake money for real resources. Elon Musk doesn't need a wealth tax. He's free to hoard as much monopoly money as he wants. But we should've taxed the shit out of him when he bought Twitter. We should be taxing the shit out of every yacht, private jet, and 4th vacation home purchase. If the economy is slowing down because the rich are siphoning money out of the economy and not spending it, we should remind ourselves that money is fake and print more to replace what's removed.",

  "selftext": "To be clear, I am more pro Israel than most on even Zionists on Reddit but you can be pro not dissolving nations, and understand that the creation of said nations was a top 5 evil event in history, just like we do for the USA or China. I  am more pro Israel because I respect her right to exist while knowing about the evil of her inception, while so called “Zionists” deny that this evil happened or claim that Israel was actually created because *Palestinians* refused a peaceful one state solution, which is insanity.\n\nAnyone with any grasp of historical knowledge knows that the British are at fault for the conflict today. The British simply had to do one thing to avoid todays conflict. Simply say “no” to any new immigrants who wanted to come. This would’ve been an awesome and humanitarian move because all the existing Jewish and Arab communities in the region would’ve been able to coexist peacefully like they did under Ottoman rule (though to be clear ottoman rule wasn’t ethical either, only full determination of Palestinian communities as they were the majority of all the communities there and had no problem coexisting with Jews). \n\nInstead, they chose to legalize European invaders coming in who had expressed intent of ethnically cleansing Arabs (immigrating to establish a state where others are living is by definition ethnic cleansing). **Even if they didn’t express such intent, their very immigration for the purpose of creating a state that included communities where they had no majority (so essentially ruling over and/or displacing Arabs)  was inherently an extreme evil.** They made deals with said invaders that the colonial power would displace and kill natives so that they could establish an ethnostate, and pretend that they were trying to rectify the Holocaust. So yes, this conflict is the UK’s fault. They failed to use their colonial rule to stop invaders from immigrating to areas where their subjects lived. \n\nThe problem with people on this sub is that they think you’re calling for the UK to kick out all the people they let invade. This is silliness as there’s no way the UK would dissolve its baby state. *What the UK should do is apologize to the Palestinians for letting anyone into their communities, much in the same way Germany did post Holocaust or the USA did for Japanese internment camps.*\n\nAnd people will say, how does it bring us closer to peace if we rightfully acknowledge the UK’s role in the inception of Israel and the evils of Zionist migration. I say, it does not matter at all because the point of accurate history isn’t peace, but to keep an accurate record of the past to learn from. \n\n*Keeping an accurate record of history is important irregardless of if it brings peace or not. Not to mention we owe nothing to Israelis or Palestinians outside of keeping a solid record of the past and not demonizing the Palestinians of pre48 times, who were undisputed good guys.* \n\nAlso, pre 48Palestinians definitely lost, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t credit them for the good they tried to bring to the world. To not do so has nothing to do with today’s conflict, but it’s simply disrespectful to the pre 48 Palestinians and their descendents to not do the bare minimum and acknowledge they were the good guys.\n\n**Just like it would be evil to say or ignore the fact that Turks did commit genocide against Armenians, even though such denial wouldn’t\nhave any affect on peace in the region. Any historical revisionism is a huge evil.**",

I know many people who are not smart. They cannot understand certain concepts. However, what they can do is memorise the keywords, which is more than enough for them to get a good career and good marks in college. Whereas, only smart people can actually understand concepts. However, they are in the same situation as their not-so-smart peers, since they also have the same degree and job opportunities, provided they get similar marks in examinations. Remember; Silencer was also successful as well. He had a manaion, a rich girlfriend, a lot of wealth, and was going to sign a contract with a famous scientist, Phunsukh Wangdu, who had rejected all his clients who were international clients. This was how successful he was, since he had good grades. The other 2 who had tagged along with Rancho were not successful at all, since they were not smart enough to understand concepts.\n\nThe 2nd reason for me believing so is that India has the highest population! Almost all of them want to get a joob job with a good salary, right? There is no way to escape the rat race in order to get a good future! There is no proper way to check the understanding of lakhs of clients other than examinations! Therefore, they will be writing examinations for the rest of their lives! If writing examinations in the real-world is in any way, similar to writing examinations within academic institutions, then Virus's advice holds true! Understanding concepts is not going to get you anywhere if you do not know how to work hard and compete with others! Life will neither be fair in college, nor in real life!\n\nThe 3rd reason for me believing so is that many famous actors are famous due to competition and  hard-work. Eg.Shahrukh Khan did not have any links with famous people, and was instead orphaned. However, he worked day-and-night to compete with actors who had the benefit of nepotism. In the end, Shahrukh Khan has been the most famous actor worldwide, known in Eastern-Europe, Africa, and Asia, for 34 years. Mithun Chalraborthu has no links with famous people either, and he was well-known in Asia and the communist block too.",

  "selftext": "This one's for fellow artists. I'm a professional 3D artist, and I've come to believe that almost all teaching about \"color theory\" is misguided.\n\nThe way I see it, there are three flavors of color theory:\n\n1. Color psychology\n2. Color harmonies\n3. Color space\n\nI think color psychology is an absolute pseudoscience. Color harmonies are impressively misunderstood. *Color space is fine. I have no problem with actual color science.*\n\n**Color psychology:**\n\n**Tl;dr: it's too easy to make an image that doesn't fit its colors' \"meanings\"**\n\nThe belief that an artist can communicate various concepts or emotions with their choice of color. It's usually communicated as \"blue is professional, orange is energetic,\" and the like. You'll find tables online giving you the list of meanings of colors.\n\nTwo problems:\n\n1. It's exceedingly easy to make a picture communicate all the wrong things according to its color psychology. As an experiment, I sampled a bunch of words often associated with blue, and made a picture using absolutely no blue.  \nTranquility, cleanliness: [A still lake in the sunset.](https://imgur.com/dTBa8Qe)  \nFreedom: [Open space](https://imgur.com/ulHoEnF).  \nFreshness: [Lush vegetation](https://imgur.com/zy17EVN).  \nStability: [A castle](https://imgur.com/ALEtNyd).  \nAuthority, wisdom, sadness: [A somber old wizard](https://imgur.com/SQ5tAsf).  \nAnd all the while, it was sore easy to avoid the concepts associated with my primary colors, orange and green: Orange: Youth, health, danger. Green: Prosperity, health, envy, corruption.\n2. There are obviously connotations to different colors, but those are idiosyncratic to individuals and to cultures. It is not possible to say beforehand what association your audience will have with your color choices. That is unless you pick something unnatural. Blood will always be red, so if you paint green blood, it will look strange, and you can bank on your audience thinking it's strange.\n\n**Color harmonies:**\n\n**Tl;dr: Images that don't follow them can be beautiful, and images that do can be ugly**\n\nColor harmonies are specific relationships of hues on the color wheel. There are many claims online about these, and I find most of them dubious, so it's hard to recount them faithfully. But I'll try.\n\nPeople seem to say that the established schemes (triadic, analogous, complementary, etc.) simply \"look good\" together. Patently false. It's so easy to make them look terrible together that it's hard to fathom how this argument ever gained any foothold. It's also easy to make a color scheme that looks nice and *isn't* an established harmony on the wheel.\n\nSome people say that they communicate different emotions. Complementary, for instance, has \"tension,\" since the colors are opposite each other on the wheel. Problem here is, people can't seem to agree on the emotion they convey. I also find sources stating that complementary schemes are \"naturally pleasant.\"\n\nAnd when people analyze classical paintings and movies, they seem to always miss something very important: There are millions of colors on the screen. When you look at a vectorscope (a color wheel where every pixel is plotted,) you'll almost always find that the image doesn't neatly fit into any scheme. It's usually all over the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love see what benefits people actually get from color theory. Bring it on! Help me learn.",

  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy post today is about my experience after many years of playing multiplayer games and participating in online forums.  \n\nBotting has always been a hot topic.  I would say my post mainly focuses on MMOs although I believe it extends to any game with marketable items *or* long term farmable rewards.  \n\nOften in these communities you see a sentiment that companies are not doing enough to combat botting, but when they rarely comment, developers often cite the tens if not hundreds of thousands of bots they are banning yearly.  \n\nIt’s “not enough” though as any game with an economy quickly is plagued by bots profiting off of the selling of gold or even farmed accounts.  Players feel their time is devalued as the value of gold drops, and they feel their achievements are lessened as more bot accounts reach those milestones.  \n\nThere are generally two common arguments I see:\n\n1). Companies either laying off or simply refusing to hire game masters to police their servers in real time.\n\nThis argument falls short for two reasons.  If these companies are really banning tens to hundreds of thousands of bots, even a dozen game masters would be a drop in the bucket.  They only make an impact by banning the most visible bots, at the highest and lowest end at the cost of hundreds of thousands.\n\n2).  Companies don’t want bots banned because it hurts their revenue.\n\nThis argument is uninformed and conspiracy like.  Having spoken to many owners of bot farm, these people aren’t paying the company for new accounts, they are buying them for pennies on the dollar from “suppliers” who use stolen credit cards (which are eventually reversed) or in low cost currencies.  Some games (like RuneScape) have had to take drastic action after banks threatened to not work with them.\n\n Botting is an arms race that goes through cycles as both sides upgrade their technology.  From a player perspective it sucks, but is just an inevitability.\n\nI am open to changing my view because I hate the impact bots have in games, I just don’t see it happening with what I know and haven’t seen any popular games do it successfully.",

Would it be the fault of women or any particular woman EVEN IF that was proven to be a fact. If this drove him to low self esteem, suicide or going on a rampage would it be the fault of women? I think we'd all agree of course not. \n\nBut when it comes to unrealistic beauty standards the blame is placed on men and their preferences as a driving force for women who want to seek out those standards. If a man wants a woman with big boobs, a slim waist and big butt he's ridiculed for not knowing what real women look like...but real women can in fact look like this, both naturally and through surgery. If a man wants a woman who looks perfect whether in or out of make up he's being delusional. If a man wants a fit girl who looks like a model it's questioned can he fulfill the same standard.

Such as - not taunting or mocking after you've beaten a team or an opponent, not rubbing it in, etc. It was like the loser is supposed to bear all the burden of \"sportsmanship,\" but somehow the winner isn't required to share some responsibility of being sportsmanlike.\n\nMy view - which I am open to being changed - is that \"sportsmanship\" applies to both sides equally. It's important for kids to learn to be gracious in defeat, but they also need to learn to be gracious in victory as well. And if it's only taught in a lopsided manner, especially to kids who are still developing and learning, it makes it doubly hard for the losers.\n\nIt's hard enough to teach kids to be gracious in losing when the winning team is behaving well.

However, dev's frequently publicly lie through their goddamn teeth to audiences of millions via twitter, regular marketing,livestreams and collabs with various youtube/twitch personalities. \n\n Straight up entire falsehoods, deliberate misleading statements, trailers not only edited to look greater that the game could ever be(graphically) but containing events and characters that do not even exist in the game(TLOU2 for example). the Devs damn well know the state of their own game, but how often do we receive an anonymous leak forewarning the horrific impending state of a game?? literally never.  And so in my opinion, this makes the developers morally culpable for and complicit in the absurd bullshit the marketing and management folks come up with and implement. If any other industry engaged in such behaviour, the people who actually implement such things wouldn't escape criticism and judgement.  \n A Shitty Construction company cuts corners and uses substandard material on orders from the higher-ups, the Carpenter who built your house that collapsed knew what he was doing the entire time, and saying \"i couldnt do anything or i'd be punished/lose my job\" doesn't absolve them of their guilt. Why do people and the Dev's believe that being in some kind of creative medium somehow distances them from their own actions and the consequences thereof?  \n\n\n  \n2)Microtransactions: same argument as  above, \"oh i was just following orders\" or \"if i didn't do it somebody else would!! and i'd lose my job\" are totally understandable reactions to being told \"you coded this shit, it's directly your fault\".  But guess what, if it's your job to implement a monetization system that deliberately preys on ignorant kids with access to mom and dads credit cards, those with a weakness to gambling, and contains the worst kind of skinner box FOMO influenced borderline abusive tactics, guess what? You're a massive piece of shit doing something horrible. Beyond the basic monetization, many games are entirely Warped by/built around the microtransactions they contain, ensuring the entire game is made worse just by the presence of monetization, meaning other devs beyond the Monetization team choose to make their games worse deliberately to assist abusive practices. so they can get fucked too.  I don't care if it's your job, if your job requires you to be a piece of shit, you don't get to complain when someone calls you a piece of shit.  \n\n\nin conclusion, carrying out malicious bullshit orders from above doesn't absolve you from the fact that you still did the shitty thing, and being a \"creative\" \"artistic\" type doesn't magically make you not responsible for your own actions.",

I am extremely confident that not only will self-driving become common, but so common that most people will actually *stop* buying cars (at least in developed countries).\n\nTeslas (as one example) are already at the stage where they are safer than the average human driver when using full self-driving software. It's not even close. Eventually, we'll get to the point where we're having serious debates about the safety of non-autonomous cars. We used to say seatbelt laws were a restriction on our freedom, but we got used to that and now almost everyone is wearing seatbelts. \n\nOnce legislators and the population realise that self-driving vehicles are clearly safer, we will see demand for them grow, especially in the wealthier countries. We'll get so comfortable with them driving around that we'll allow them to drive *without* anyone even in the car. Sure, there will be places that are hesitant to do this at first, but when countries see other countries allowing it, they will see what they're missing out on. \n\nAt this point, instead of owning cars, people will be using transportation as a service (TaaS). This is the reason people will stop buying cars. People will own fleets of autonomous vehicles, which will drive to pick up people at the click of a button on an app (like Uber). There are several advantages to this:  \n1. You won't need upfront capital to purchase a car  \n2. You won't need garage space or street space to park your car  \n3. You won't need to wash, service, or fix the car.   \n4. You won't have a car that depreciates even though it's not being used  \n5. You won't need to pay registration and insurance (this will be factored into the ride cost)  \n6.

I don't hunt but honestly I think its way less ethical to buy from a store than to hunt for yourself. The meat industry has a huge impact on global warming, it takes up massive amounts of land, and most animals live and die in horribly cruel circumstances. I am not innocent of buying meat from the grocery store, but I only eat meat about once every two weeks and try to treat it like a luxury instead of an every day food.\n\nI mean, even from an animal rights standpoint, what is better? an animal living its life in nature, with plenty of land to roam, or stuck in a tiny poo covered pen and only fed corn? It reminds me of that Parks and Rec episode where Ron brings a pig to slaughter for a family BBQ. There was gonna be a dead pig either way, slaughtering it in front of you only reminds you that at one point it was a live animal.\n\nI don't think trophy hunting is really justifiable. But hunting for food is a lot more ethical than buying it at a grocery store.\n\nEDIT: Yall have made some great points on both sides. I agree that an increased amount of hunting could really mess up ecosystems, and that it's really hard to know the health of wild animals and if they are truly safe to eat (thank you prion disease in deer). I think the best thing would be a greater blend of ethical farming and hunting. Hunting ensures that environments are mostly respected (as opposed to farms, which destroy a lot of enviroment, ethical farms especially taking up a lot of space) and ethical farming can help supplement / prevent overhunting. Overall though I think the most important thing is that people just eat less meat and treat it more as a luxury.  ",

  "selftext": "Buckle up - this is going to be a long one.\n\nI know this might seem counterintuitive to what is being observed in modern day societies. We have murder, rape, wars, genocide, slavery, hate crimes, and large disparities between classes of people. There’s so many examples of people hoarding resources from needy underserved populations. There’s many examples of corporate greed in which they know they’re poisoning the world (see: forever chemicals such as PFO/PFAs pushed by companies like DuPont and 3M that’s now in everyone - and I do mean everyone’s - blood streams) but fail to act because it would hurt their shareholders bottom line. \n\nPersonally, I am a professional ecologist who works in the private sector in America and knows first hand how governments write and re-write laws to help bolster business profits at the expense of the environment. I am not naive to the throes of how every major system (social/racial/environmental) is basically fucked and in need of a major upheaval to get things back on track - if they were ever on track in the first place.\n\nAll of this can be chalked up to greed of the few at the expense of the many. This greed seems to trickle down to the everyday person because if you’re not looking out for number one you’ll get left behind in the poisonous dust, polluted air, and contaminated drinking water. You’ll be poor, uneducated, and forever stuck in the cycle of being exploited for what little you do have by those who want it all.\n\nHowever, I am currently in the process of writing a book about how f*cked humans are, how we got here, and what we can do about it. Through my interdisciplinary research I have discovered surprising theories contrary to what is obviously happening to us all. Which has changed my pessimistic POV of what being human really means.\n\nRichard Dawkins might be the proponent of the trickle up theory of how our genes are selfish which equates to us as humans being selfish but I have come to the conclusion that he is ultimately short sighted in his argument.\n\nTo begin let’s get some dates straight - humans (Homo sapien sapien) first appeared 200,000 years ago. The beginning of modern civilization was only birthed 10,000 years ago with advent of agriculture (the Neolithic Revolution) which changed the way humans lived from migratory hunter-gathering to a more sedentary lifestyle. The sedentary life style that agriculture required is what has done us in, not our biology.\n\nWe are taught that our selfish brutish behaviors are inherent to our biology because if we just look to our closest ancestors - the chimpanzee - we will see that they too are violent creatures that live in cyclical harmony but are fraught with war, infanticide, resource hoarding, and rape. We share 98% of our DNA with them, so this must be true. But what is frequently over looked is that the chimpanzee is not our only closest relative there are also the bonobos. \n\nBonobos also share 98% of our DNA and they are free of war, rape, infanticide, and resource hoarding. They’re cooperative, have sex for pleasure and conflict resolution, and are matriarchal. Historically, pre-agriculture, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees. In our natural environment which we evolved for, not the current one we are living in, we share more with bonobos than we ever did with chimpanzees.\n\nAnthropological and archaeological investigations into hunter and gatherer tribes of the modern day show that the predominant themes between them are that they are egalitarian, cooperative, friendly, and easy going. This can be extrapolated to pre-modern humans due to the fact that these tribes, as seen in aboriginals or the Inuits to name two, have lived a traditional lifestyle up until very recently. \n\nHunter-gathering tribes consisted of up to approximately 150 individuals. Which means that everyone knows everyone which then equates to social accountability. These tribes, while there are always exceptions to the norm, shared resources and didn’t praise anyone above anyone else as everyone was doing their part in supporting the tribe. Those who might have been too aggressive, attempted to resource hoard, or were disruptive in any way were ostracized, isolated, or even killed when other means didn’t work so that social cohesion was maintained.\n\nAgriculture, on the other hand, ballooned populations due to increase fertility of women (not really a good thing) to levels where no one could know everyone which led to decrease accountability. Agriculture invented property, first with land and water, and then people were seen as resources by those who needed more workers to plow their fields. Agriculture birthed the patriarchy and made women and children into property. Agriculture created classes of the have and have nots and that led to disparity. Agriculture invented slavery as “civilized” societies captured and drug in hunter and gathering societies by their feet into their communities for cheap labor. Agriculture caused those in power to hoard resources from the greater collective. Agriculture led to wars between societies looking for more resources. Agriculture is the root of zoonotic (influenza, SARs, chickenpox etc) diseases to spread through our species. Agriculture led to famines as climate patterns changed. Agriculture led to the balloon of mental health problems. Agriculture is what destroyed our egalitarian ways.\n\nWe lived for approximately 190,000 years as hunter gathers amongst our family and kin. We lived in an environment which we were evolved for and we as a species were better for it. As Darwin points out, altruism and cooperation was naturally selected for because it was better for the species and as social animals because protecting our communities was as important as important as protecting oneself.\n\nSo, no we aren’t inherently selfish like Dawkins tries to claim nor are we naturally violent as our chimpanzee cousins. These are both symptoms of a sickness caused by living in an unnatural system. Just as birds who are kept confined that pluck out all their feathers, we are losing our minds and what it means to be truly human because of modern society - something we are not evolved for.\n\nTL;DR humans are not naturally violent and selfish as modern day evidence has led us to believe. We lived as egalitarian altruistic communities for 190,000 years before the invention of agriculture. Agriculture and the sedentary life style that it required is what has caused us to become who we are today and is not a true reflection of the human species.",

  "selftext": "Note: this view does not apply to urinals. And my view does not include \"businesses should be forced to remove existing auto-flushers and convert them to manual ones\".  And it's a fairly light-hearted view, so please don't take it too seriously.\n\nThere are two main reasons I hold this view.\n\nOne: I have had too many experiences where the sensor is completely faulty, leading to one of two outcomes - you finish your business and then hunt around to figure out where the hidden \"manual flush\" option is because nothing is moving, or it seems to be working in reverse and it flushes the second you sit down, leading to splashback.\n\nTwo: if you're having digestive issues, whether it's chronic or temporary, your waste can tell you a lot. Maybe you need to take a quick visual check on things to make sure the color looks right, determine whether any blood might be present, see if that corn you ate the day before is moving through at a proper speed or if it's showing up four days after you ate it, and so on. But when the toilet flushes the instant you try standing up, you lose the ability to check on that.\n\nSo to me, there's no advantage to an auto-flush, and only drawbacks. Again, not enough that I believe that existing auto-flushes should be forcibly removed. I just think they shouldn't be used going forward. Change my view!\n\nedit: dirty handles won't change my view.  Use some wadded up toilet paper if you're that worried about it, and either way, wash your hands when you're done using the bathroom.  ",

Before I get into it I'd like to preface this by saying I'm aware of the social norms and the potential backlash. \n\nI'm not a bad person, I try to help people and I know deep down at least some part of you will agree with this view. Anyway, change my view... I think forks are the best utensil for spreading mayo onto bread. \n\nLet's start with the dollop. A knife provides a laughable amount of mayo, so you'll be going back to the jar two, maybe three times. Spoon is second best for dollop but still has the potential to drastically overload the sandwich. By the time you finish the sandwich you'll be wearing half of the mayo. \n\nOnto the spread. The spoon is obviously the worst, getting an even spread is impossible, the lowest valley of the spoon forces mayo towards the edges and creates a wave of mayo that ends up piling onto the edge of your sandwich, increasing spill danger. The knife is good, a lot of people would even say great. I'll use a knife if I'm in a pinch but a fork works just as well, with the added dollop bonus. The forks voids allow mayo to seep through, back into dollop position. From here it's easy to either spread it on a dry area of bread or send it right back into the tub. \n\nOfficial rankings below\n\nDollop \nSpoon- 8/10\nFork-10/10\nKnife- 3/10\n\nSpread\nSpoon - 4/10\nFork-10/10\nKnife-9/10\n\nOvr- \nSpoon- 6/10\nKnife- 6/10\nFork-10/10\n\nEdit: I've been made aware that several people just want a bit of mayo on their sandies, that's okay. My sandwiches are usually pretty thick, like half the container of turkey, one slice of melted cheese and a decent bit of lettuce. If it's a small sandwich then sure, knife is fine. But if you want to get serious about sandwiches you gotta pull the fork out. \n\nOpinion unchanged for big sandwich people, I'll give you that knife dollops are fine for little sandwiches, probably even equal to the fork.

  "selftext": "This thought came about from my own realization that I had been overly precious about it most of my life.\nI learned that dish soap is not in any way anti-microbial but simply an emulsifier, i.e. helps dissolve any oils so that you can rinse away any food residue.\n\nIf your dish is non-porous, then as long as you remove all the food residue and make sure to completely dry the dish (not with a bacteria-ridden dish cloth), then you’re good to go. For a dish that’s not overly oily with and has no stubbornly stuck-on food, hot water and a clean dish rag could do the trick.\n\nThis is in fact part of why cast iron care works, only you don’t even remove the oil completely because heating the pan when you cook helps keep the harmful microbes at bay (still need to get that food residue off though - don’t be that person using under-seasoned cast iron!).\n\nWith porous dishes (like wooden spoons) the soap’s emulsification is essential to be sure you’ve completely removed all residue (and even then, you may want to use a dishwasher or boiling water to clean a particularly nasty spoon).\n\nEDIT: “dish soap is not in any way anti-microbial but simply an emulsifier”. \nThank you all for the correction on this point, dish soap can and does kill some microbes, however this isn’t its primary purpose or design. Rather, it’s meant to use its emulsive properties to lift microbes away from a surface thereby making it easier to rinse them away. That said, if you’re wanting to completely sanitize something (especially with a porous and/or rough surface), dish soap is not the way to do it as it will certainly not kill everything. \n\nEDIT2: I agree that my title is over the top.

  "selftext": "One of the more popular stances people have when it comes to art is that anything can be considered art because there are no hard rules for what can and cannot be art. To me, this can't be true because concept involves categorization. There are things that are inclusive to a concept, but on the other side of the coin there are things that are excluded from it because it doesn't fit a concept's general idea. For example, there's happiness and sadness, freedom and restraint, chaos and civility, etc. Every idea is paired with another opposing idea that illustrates a general ruleset of what can be grouped into a concept. So why should art be any different? If we can consider art to be anything we want, then at that point art simply becomes synonymous with \"anything\" and thus has no unique traits to warrant it being it's own concept. It becomes an utterly meaningless concept.\n\nYou've probably heard of sayings along the lines of \"if everyone is \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. then no one is.\"  That's pretty much the general idea I'm laying out. Art has no value as an concept if we can just label anything we want as art. There has to be restrictions. Random noises cannot be art. Random scribbles cannot be art. Art has to have intention, technique, and meaning from the creator - and there needs to be a creator in the first place. It wouldn't make sense to say something like \"the Sun is art\" because no human being had any involvement in the Sun's creation. Art has to be an intentional form of self-expression.",

  "selftext": "First off, I am all for regulation. I am no ancap who wants McMilitia's fighting it out with the Royal Burger Army in the streets. I am also (basically) left leaning, at least in the American sense. However I will say that this anti-capitalist mood I have observed in recent generations is downright dangerous to world prosperity. Capitalism, when controlled by robust regulations is the best economic system in human history hands down.  Ill outline my reasons down below:  \n1. A economically free society is a politically free society. A state that holds tight controls over the economic engines of the nation will grow its bureaucracy to do so, said state control will invariably, history has shown us, expand further than the economic sphere. Political rights will be curtailed, freedoms will be rolled back and the people will be oppressed. Look to the Soviet Union as proof of this. They used their total control of the economy and its processes to effect political atrocities, most notably the Holodomor when Stalin exported grain from famine-wracked Ukraine to starve as many of them to death as possible.  \n\n\n2. Firms in a *regulated* Capitalist economy will be rewarded for increased innovation and efficiency, thereby incentivizing both. This not only pushes technology forwards but invariably benefits the consumer. Again look at the Soviet Union and its '[Era of Stagnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Stagnation)', or [America during the late 1800s and 1900s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age) when the economy was dominated by monopolies or, for a more recent example, look at when [AT&T was broken up in the 1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_the_Bell_System). In the Communist nations total government control effectively suffocated innovation and economic growth, leading to the stagnation if the 1970s and 1980s and led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. China adapted by allowing limited Capitalism into their country and their economy took off, growing an [average of 9.5% a year](https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL33534.html) through 2018. Other communist countries like Vietnam followed and began to prosper or didn't, like North Korea, and well, didn't. Though I will admit there are also other...extenuating circumstances pertaining to North Korea. Speaking of North Korea actually, South Korea is a perfect example of this as well. Their GDP was was behind North Korea's until the '[Miracle on the Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_on_the_Han_River)'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3, There are no alternatives. This one is pretty simple. There is simply nothing better. Communism has failed, several times. Fascism has failed, several times. The world is dominated by free market economies for a reason. There is the famous Winston Churchill quote \"It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others that have been tried\". I believe firmly that the same quote can be applied to Capitalism, well regulated.  \n",

I think to raise a whole other human being from infanthood, with so much control over every little aspect of their life and the life that they have is insane. You can't just have to be human to do that, you have to be a superhuman!\n\nFor me, there's no point in creating a whole new person if I'm not going to give them the best life possible. If I'm going to have a child in the far future, I'm not going to be doing it mostly for myself. It's going to be primarily for the child I'm having. It's not: \"I want a child\". It's: \"I want to give my child the absolute best life possible so that the love they'll experience will outweigh the pain they will inevitably experience as a sentient human on planet Earth\".So, I would want have at least 1 million dollars before I do that. If not, I'm just causing strife to myself, as I'll have to do so much to care of a child and also to the child, since I won't just be financially stressed, I also won't be able to give them full emotional care if I'm not appropriately wealthy when it comes to having a child.\n\nNow, this not me insulting parents who aren't finacially wealthy. I'm sure A LOT of them are extremely and purely loving and good to their child. I'm sure they are extremely, extremely good parents. And I'm sure their child feels a lot of love and happiness with them. I just think that when you want to have a child while not finacially stable, you should deeply think to yourself: \"Am I capable of raising this child with my finacial struggles while giving them to best physical and emotion care that they need and deserve while always loving and not feeling resentment towards this child?\" This also applies to finacially stable parents. This should also ask this question, just that the finacial stress part of it is alleviated already.",

  "selftext": "One of the biggest things that irritates America's youth is how the people running our country are so old and out of touch. This transcends the political divide. Whether you're a liberal or conservative, you're annoyed at just how old the people running America are. \n\nOh yes. The hated 21 drinking age. Hardly the worst, but certainly the most common thing older generations impose on us. At 18 we're old enough to take out literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loans, but God forbid we drink. That's off limits. This is a product of a larger culture surrounding alcohol in the U.S. that makes it taboo. It has religious conservative roots and much of it, such as open container laws, has no actual basis and is simply a relic of archaic temperance era laws. \n\nAs for why I think this attitude is bound to die eventually, it's because it already declined once during the Vietnam War. Around 1972, the drinking age was lowered across most of the country and many alcohol laws were loosened as it was very questionable to tell young men to go fight for a country that restricted their liberties so heavily back home. Of course, this was reversed in the mid 80's because of the imaginary \"drunk driving epidemic\". The MADD propaganda was that of menacing drunk teenagers turning the roads into war zones. And the 1984 MLDA law cured this problem (sure just ignore the fact that seat belts were introduced at this same time, it couldn't have been them reducing the road fatalities). So the attitude was revived because of fear mongering.\n\nBut with the rise of increasingly autonomous and even some self driving vehicles, the drunk driver argument will soon be obsolete. Which will leave only the \"alcohol is bad for young people\" argument. And I think this is where our generation will wake up and see that it was never about protecting us. If it was, we wouldn't have nonstop school shootings. If it was, we would have a mental health system that worked. It has always been about older people wanting to restrain the youth so that they can feel safer, but having no interest in the wellbeing of youth. And I think we'll be well too aware of this to care enough to preserve archaic societal expectations that no other country has. Seriously, in Germany and Belgium 16 year olds are free to socialize in beer gardens. Are their societies collapsing? It doesn't look like it. \n\nI have not found a single reason to believe my generation will have any interest in preserving such archaic customs. But old habits die hard, and I'm open to considering other factors at play here. ",

  "selftext": "*I am starting this one with a genuine hope that someone can change my view. Please, change my view, I really hate having it.*\n\nThis problem comes up everywhere, but I'll explain on the example of gender debate as it's what I'm most embedded in. I realise it's massive in politics but it's not what I'm focusing on here.\n\nThe one thing I battle with the most is the tendency to paint all men or all women as being this or that, and using it to justify dismissing them and their problems, saying they're not deserving of something, justifying being mean to them, discriminating against them while claiming they asked for it, punishing an individual for the sins of the group, and so on.\n\nVery often B&W thinking is underlined by some painful personal experience with one person or more, which is then generalised to the entire gender. Sometimes it's super overt, like [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0g2drvCUYj/) (men think of their families, women only about themselves) or [here](https://medium.com/@donna.gratehouse/society-does-include-men-but-whenever-society-is-being-called-upon-to-address-mens-problems-it-s-6ea30fe2f4ac) (women want to help men but all they ever get in return is violence). Other times it's by implication, like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiDpvn77eqE&lc=UgyZ5Bm0GnM23wIQ5wR4AaABAg) (highlighted comment implying that all women want marriage and will make it a disaster for men) or [here](https://medium.com/@lelper/10-things-for-guys-not-to-do-on-dating-apps-5680ce34ffd9) (men are shit at dating, listing 10 sins which are hardly things only men do). I'm literally just picking a couple examples I've got fresh in my mind, but there are millions around. \n\nIt's usually examples of the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error). \n\n* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the good ones and everything **we** do is good or, if it's bad, it's because **They** provoked us or deserved it anyway. Meanwhile, when **They** do something bad, it's proof of their wicked evil nature.\n* Whichever side you're on, **We** are always the innocent victims and underdogs and **They** are the perpetrators in power.\n\nThose basic narratives are so powerful and play so hard to the tribal thinking we evolved with, that it's incredibly hard to break out of them. The simplicity of this heuristic just makes it win with the complex truth that the world is not B&W but all shades and colours, that everybody is different and you can't just treat groups as monoliths. They might have power in this domain but we have power in another, many people in the group might have power but not necessarily this person, some of us are also pretty shitty sometimes while some of them are actually great, and so on.\n\nOf course, there are many who know this. When you explicitly ask people about it, many will say this. But in practice, most still act and overwhelmingly think in terms of black-and-white. And it's a constant in human history - it's as much of a problem now as it was in Ancient Greece, we have evolved nothing.\n\nWhat does this mean? It means that it is just such a bloody pain to get through to people! To help them stop spending so much energy on fighting each other and instead use it on making the world better for everyone. We keep fighting culture wars with imagined enemies and make everyone's lives miserable, while all it would take is to just stop and admit that there is in fact no us and them. That we're just all people who make mistakes and can get better.\n\nBut so I go, trying to promote this view, yet every time I feel like I succeeded on some small scale, I just see more and more of that everywhere else. It seems so inescapable. Can you please change my view and show me that it's not?",

  "title": "CMV: Suicide prevention policies have more in common with blasphemy laws, more than they do with public health policy. They are motivated more strongly by the fear that life might be bad, than the conviction that life is good.",
  "selftext": "Let's imagine that you are throwing a big party for your family and friends. You've put in a lot of work, and you're confident that everyone in attendance is going to have a great time. The very last thing that you'd think to do would be to hire a firm of big, burly bouncers to guard the doors of your house to keep people *in* and make sure that nobody can leave before you had decided that the party had ended. If the party was any good, you would expect the guests to choose to stay of their own volition, without any threats of coercion, and without their exit being blocked.\n\nImagine that you had attended such a party, you decided after about an hour that you weren't having a good time and decided that you wanted to leave; and you found that your path was blocked by a large, beefy security guard. When you explained that you would like to leave, he told you that the party was objectively wonderful and that your decision to leave was evidence that you were of unsound judgement. Therefore, by continuing to detain you at the party, he was actually protecting your own best interests against your faulty judgement. Would you humbly accept that you were, in fact, wrong in your assessment of the party and that your decision to leave is symptomatic of a profound impairment in your capacity to make decisions that reflect your rational best interests? Or would you be more likely to conclude that the fact that strongarm tactics had to be employed to stop you from leaving was, in fact, evidence of deep insecurity on the part of the host?\n\nBlasphemy laws in Islamic countries work on a similar principle to this. These laws don't exist because a Muslim's faith in his religion is so strong that there is nothing that could ever possibly be said to cause his belief to waver in the slightest. They exist for the opposite reason - because faith in Islam, or any other empirically unproven belief system is dependent on mutual confirmation from the people around oneself. If everyone around you, and all the people that you admire and respect, share the same belief system and the same strong faith, then you will most likely retain your own strong faith as well. However, if all around you, people that you generally hold in high esteem for their intelligence and level-headedness start to express deep-seated doubts about what they (and you) have been taught to believe, then there is a strong chance that, over time, your own faith will start to weaken.\n\nIf you depend on your faith to provide you with your sense of meaning and purpose in life; then this process of finding your faith start to falter can be extremely distressing, and this is why you might be driven to develop defence mechanisms to try and prevent you from being exposed to any evidence or alternative viewpoint which contradicts your own worldview.\n\nI believe that the same process is in play when we talk about suicide. It can't have gone unnoticed by many that we are currently in the grips of a moral panic concerning the subject of suicide, which is being portrayed as an ongoing public health emergency. From the amount of suicide prevention campaigns that we get in the UK, and from the urgency that governments are being called upon to act to reduce suicide rates in the UK, you would fully expect that people were positively queuing up all day, every day, to jump from Tower Bridge into the Thames. When in fact, we have not seen a recent upsurge in the suicide rates in the UK, and suicide rates in the UK remain low by European and worldwide standards.\n\nAll suicide prevention schemes, without exception, draw upon the same tired old stereotypes and tropes about suicidal people being emotionally unstable and are in urgent need of treatment for a presumed mental health issue. They have constructed a rhetorical fortress whereby any person asking for the right to be suicide can be summarily discredited as \"mentally ill\" (i.e. they are unreliable witnesses to their own thoughts, and cannot be taken seriously) and in urgent need of mental healthcare. Conveniently for proponents of suicide prevention, these presumptions of mental illness are completely unfalsifiable, and in merely making the insinuation that someone is mentally ill, you open up a credibility gap between the suicidal person who is deemed unsound of mind, and the rest of society who has a paternalistic duty of care to make sure that the suicidal person does not have the opportunity to make plans to act based on their allegedly compromised mental state.\n\nAs a general principle, I think that if you feel confident that your opinion is well informed, then you don't mind allowing people on the opposite side of the debate to put across their ideas, and to have an open exchange of ideas. I don't think that you would need to try and portray your interlocutor as being mentally deranged, or assert that they've been possessed by the devil in order to shut down their viewpoint before they've even had the chance to express it. You'd let them speak, and then you would calmly go through their argument, point by point, and show them the errors in their reasoning. For example, it doesn't seem that atheists are quite as defensive about their ideas as devoutly religious folk; as firstly, atheists are simply advancing the null hypothesis with relation to God's existence, and usually don't seem to be as strongly emotionally invested in their perspective as theists are. But as we see from blasphemy laws, devout theists are often very defensive about their beliefs, even to the point where they are prepared to use extreme violence to shut down any opposing perspective\n\nAlthough suicide prevention advocates aren't typically resorting to stoning people to death for expressing heterodox views about bodily sovereignty (which would, of course, defeat the purpose of suicide prevention); people on that side of the debate do seem to get very \"triggered\" by any suggestion that there is more moral complexity to the issue of suicide prevention than they are willing to allow. After years of debating the issue of the right to suicide on Reddit and Twitter/X; one trend that I've noticed is that many of the people who are most passionately opposed to the right to die are people who themselves report having had suicidal thoughts in the past, or even being suicidal in the present. This puts me in mind of anecdotes about homophobic Christian preachers who later go on to be exposed to be soliciting the services of male prostitutes. It seems, from the outsider's perspective, that denouncing homosexuality as sinful and perverse is how they go about resolving their own private internal conflicts. One wonders whether the same might be true about many of the people who are among the most vociferous opponents of the right to suicide.\n\nIt is my personal psychoanalytical theory that the aggressiveness of the suicide prevention lobby often stems from the same form of dissonance between the person's innate biological drive to resist death at all costs, and their nagging suspicions (suspicions that they wish to suppress) that people advocating for the right to die might actually be on to something about the ultimate futility of humanity's plight. As this is merely my armchair psychoanaylsis and I am unable to see into the minds of the people who are passionate supporters of suicide prevention, I am open minded to any evidence that might change my view on this.\n\nTo avoid any misinterpretations of my argument; one thing that I'm NOT arguing is that everyone secretly hates life and wants to die. I'm not arguing that most people see life as being bad for themselves. However, I think that many people do realise that life is essentially a zero sum game, and that in order for them to be winning, someone else has to be losing. For example, in order for me to be able to affordably clothe and entertain myself living in a developed nation, this requires sweatshop workers to be toiling in sweatshop conditions to produce the clothes for pennies an hour. In order for me to indulge my love of travel, I have to contribute to global warming. And in order for each person to enjoy their lives as individuals, they kind of depend on other people sticking around (whether by choice, or by force) so that they don't have to live their life mired in loneliness and grief. If people were freely allowed to commit suicide, then I think that a lot of people know that there's a risk that the whole enterprise of human life would be exposed as a house of cards that was prone to collapse if people couldn't be forced to stick around to be exploited for the benefit of those who are more fortunate.",

I do not agree with this sentiment. \n\nFirst, a look at the critical consensuses of the games (mainline platformers only, not going through like 150 games).\n\nSonic 1 is considered ok, but nothing special. Sonic 2 is considered phenomenal, as are 3 and Knuckles. CD has a mixed reception. Sonic Adventure 1 & 2 are critically acclaimed. Sonic Heroes has a mixed reception. Shadow the Hedgehog is widely derided. Sonic 06 is widely considered one of the worst games of all time. Sonic and the Secret Rings is considered horrible, and Sonic Unleashed is considered solid. Sonic and the Black Knight is a marked improvement on Secret Rings, but still not great. Sonic Colors is generally liked, whereas Sonic 4 is widely disliked.  Sonic Generations is beloved, but Sonic Lost World is considered underwhelming. Like 06, Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric is widely considered among the worst games of all time. Sonic Mania is beloved, whereas Sonic Forces was panned. Sonic Frontiers and Sonic Superstars were each considered allright.\n\nSee what I'm getting at here? There are some fantastic Sonic games, but the sheer quantity of shitty ones justifies the amount of hate the series gets. I played Secret Rings several years ago and good god, it is truly detestable.\n\nDon't even get me started on the fanbase, either. A dissenting opinion is quickly silenced with an avalanche of unwarranted hatred, causing this community to be among the most toxic in all of gaming (seriously up there with Smash Bros and League of Legends). The OCs are famously cringey much of the time, and the r34 is even worse.\n\nNot to mention, character designs in the Sonic series are bizarre and off-putting. There is just a certain look to them that isn't quite right to me. I mean, birds have feathers and NO FINGERS but they had to invent fingers for birds just so Wave the Swallow, Jet the Hawk, and other bird characters could fit the motif of every character arbitrarily wearing gloves.\n\nAnd let's not even get into the lore.

  "selftext": "This is regarding the (very recent) broo-haha around the American-Mexican border and Texas' \"threat\" to secede from the Union. Obviously, I don't consider it even remotely serious, as I'll lay out below; and yet, it's obviously *very* serious *if* the President's response isn't carefully measured and considered.\n\nArgument #1: we know Abbott is bluffing. Secession in the modern world would inevitably lead to the collapse of economic relations with the defecting state. Furthermore, Texas doesn't produce enough on their own to make it a viable course of action. They import a significant amount of resources just to keep the state active. *Also* also, Texas is home to several active duty military bases, and the federal government simply isn't going to allow their operations to be f-ed over like that.\n\nRebuttal: Texas can (and would) receive economic and military support from other states who have signalled their intent to join them.\n\nCounterpoint: This doesn't really fix the problem, it just exacerbates it. The federal government controls the military *and* will not allow a state (or states) to usurp that control (*especially* if it's done through the National Guard because their weapons and bases are ultimately part of the Army as a whole).\n\nArgument #2: Abbott doesn't have the support and/or resources necessary to actually fight a war against anyone (or to sustain the constant flaunting of federal authority). More importantly, I don't believe he has the public on his side; and of his supporters willing to endanger their lives in a fight against the US military, I strongly suspect that far too many of them are like myself: middle aged or older, with a modicum of military experience (like, just enough to be confident in their abilities but not enough to be humble in their assessment of a given situation).\n\nRebuttal: Biden (and Congress, more generally) has an equal amount of support for pushing back against Abbott's BS; i.e. apart from people who are already in the Army, it's unlikely that anyone is going to sign up for a conflict like this, regardless of where their politics lie. This means the chance of an armed federal response is *very* small (unless the White House wants to put non-military agencies up against the military).\n\nCounterpoint: Abbott knows this and it's partly why he's willing to bluff like he is. He doesn't think Biden (or Congress) has the balls to call him out, meaning he can bluster and do or say whatever crap he wants . . . so Biden should meet him where he's at and play his stupid game.\n\nArgument #3: The whole shebang, clearly, is a politically motivated publicity stunt, with the objective being to normalize this kind of thing and to give just enough fuel to the right wing media outrage machine (because it makes it easier for them to lie about the state of the country and the upcoming election). Doing nothing ~ or equally as bad, doing anything less than demonstrating the full authority of the office) ~ only plays into their hands and lets them continue to f- with the country as a whole.\n\nRebuttal: It's *not* a \"stunt,\" though, because there *is* a crisis at the border and the federal government isn't doing anything about it.\n\nCounterpoint: I don't believe that. The reports and data I've seen do not support these \"border crisis\" claims. Any reports that claim the opposite almost universally come from right wing sources (i.e. their credibility is highly suspect). Furthermore, even if is a \"crisis\" I would argue that the very concept is highly subjective. There are people seeking a better life in America because conditions in their home nation are super bad and f-ed up. We should be looking at these folk with compassion and empathy, and we should be providing emergency resources until they can find a new home (whether in America or somewhere else). Instead, what Abbott wants is to make things worse *for everyone* by using the \"great replacement\" conspiracy theory as seedlings for sowing discontent and division. If the federal government's response allows for the right perception, Abbott and the far right will spin it as a sign that the feds are taking away people's rights (or some similar nonsense), which helps fuel the fire and so on, until \"someone\" gets angry enough to \"do something\" on their own (like the God's Army convoy that's headed to the border right now).\n\nConclusion: Biden's best course of action is to activate the National Guard under federal orders and put them to work on *anything* that keeps them away from the border. Deny Abbott (and other right wing lunatic politicians) the ability and opportunity to use their Guard units for further political BS like this*. Hell, they could even do something constructive, like rebuilding Texas' infrastructure (roads, power, cable, etc.). This would show the nation that the President has things under control *and* it would highlight just how childish and misguided people like Abbott truly are.\n\n(*within reason, of course. if a natural disaster happens in Mississippi or something, then clearly the federal government would release Guard units back to state duty to deal with that situation.)\n\nSummary: My opinion is that Biden should play Abbott's game by yanking a critical resource out from under him and putting that resource into good use, for the betterment of the state and the nation *as a whole.* What I'm looking for is an explanation for how a different response would ultimately be the better course of action.\n\nChange my view.\n\n(p.s. while I haven't provided any citations for my claims, if you disagree, please ask and/or provide opposing data. it's much more difficult to reject an argument when there's solid evidence behind it. also, in case it isn't clear, I don't have much respect for right wing political views and will be *highly* critical of them; but I will also do my best to not dismiss them out of hand.)",

I also think, if they are self medicating with cigarettes and it is legal - what right do others have to prevent you from smoking? Also, it’s not like alcohol where it could worsen a breakdown - at worst the cigs wouldnt do anything to help, but I would guess mostly they would calm people down.\n\nAlso arguments about potential health care costs from smoking don’t really factor into the immediate scenario here, and I think efforts to stop someone smoking should be made after they are through the worst of their mental health crisis.\n\nAre they any positive reasons for this ban that I am overlooking?\n\nEdit: thanks for the responses, I have stopped engaging because I am just getting downvoted when arguing for my position",

  "selftext": "why is the education system based on grades?\n\nIt's not like, a new thing to think that our education system is flawed. There's a hundred reasons why it's  not as good as they could or should be, but the one I want to focus on is grades.\n\nI always remember hearing from teachers and professors that like, \"the goal isn't the grade, it's the learning.\" If that's the case, why would you still rely on grades? Why are grades and learning not equivalent? \n\nLike, how did we get to the point where the intelligence and capability of someone in a subject is based on how many 4 option questions they can answer in a row, or how well they can synthesize a passage into an essay when given a 1 hour time limit? Why do things like attendance, participation, and homework matter in any way towards a grade that is meant to represent your understanding of a subject? Why do your grades from the start of a semester matter, if you should be at your peak knowledge by the end of one? The goal of an education is to teach. You want to take someone who doesn't have knowledge and give it to them. \n\nIt just feels really strange that we build things around grades. It makes classes feel like series of challenges that you are meant to conquer in order to earn certificates, rather than places that are meant to improve you. They have points and are formatted like competitions, some teachers setting curves that say only a certain number of people can get A's. Shouldn't the point be everyone getting an A? It makes no sense.\n\nTo me, the worst part is that the solution is extremely simple.\n\nInstead of having your class completion being based on your grade, it should be based on your ability to do the thing that the class is meant to teach. Language class? Write an essay that proves you have appropriate mastery. Math class? Take a test that requires those math skills. Science class? Do some lab work or write a paper that represents the requisite knowledge. I can't think of a single class where a practical exam of a certain standard wouldn't be better than the class itself. \n\nInstead of having courses be races to the finish line, \"we have to get through this unit, otherwise we won't know enough by the final!\" you could just organize them by topic. This class teaches you about this type of grammar in this language, this class teaches you a specific formula, this class teaches you how to write a formal paper. You can split them into multiple days for complex topics, but without placing time limits. Just hold the classes and people who need them will attend. Have schools actively build schedules to work with students. That would make things way easier on students as well. You won't be bored if you can handle taking a ton of classes concurrently, and you won't get overwhelmed if you can't handle the expected amount.\n\nThis isn't a perfect system, it's not even a good one. It's one I thought up in like 5 minutes. But I think the practical ideas of uncoupling classes and exams and making exams based on practical ability rather than testing ability are both improvements that could be made to the current education system.\n\nThat doesn't reply to all levels of education. In elementary school and middle school, I understand a grading system. You have to walk students through a course, and homework is important because you're teaching them those skills of being a student. How to study, use resources, and take notes. That stuff should be graded because part of those years is teaching kids how to learn. Also, a system like this would be too complicated to be practical for most kids.\n\nHowever, I think in higher education like high school and college, this would just work better. The current system doesn't make sense. I had friends in high school who graduated without knowing long division and I had friends who wasted years of their lives in high school because they had already gotten everything they needed out of it by junior year.\n\nIt's not like this couldn't work practically, as well. A lot of the reasons why we couldn't have a system like this 40 years ago was because we didn't have the internet. But now we do. If you need a lecture on a certain subject that isn't being taught for you for months, go watch an online lecture that's happening *today* in a classroom a hundred miles away*.* A lot of studing techniques focus on memorization because you need memorization so you can do multiple choice quizzes. Why should you need to memorize material when you have all the knowledge in the world a quick internet search away? What matters is how you use that knowledge, that you know how to find good sources, stuff like that.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that the education system doesn't make any practical sense. Grades are meaningless. It's no wonder that people don't want to hire fresh graduates. They just spent 16 years learning how to be a student, not how to work. It's also less efficient, causing people who learn faster or slower to have a worse education experience for no reason. Its goals also don't make much sense, as with the internet the types of information we need to have memorized have shifted. We don't need to have every fact memorized, we need skills, intuition, and knowledge of resources.\n\nIs there a reason why the education system is like this, or is it just too hard to change it into something better?",

  "selftext": "Should preface this by saying I’m not an economist. But based on recent conversations, it seems some people think specific freedoms and human rights are necessary for create a good economic situation. I strongly disagree with this, and there’s numerous historical examples that prove otherwise.\n\nMost European colonial empires were absolutely brutal in their treatment of native populations in the colonies, yet these empires made up nearly the entirety of the global economy. Specifically the British and French Empires. King Leopold would be a more “tame” example however, as most of his pillaging seemed to have been limited to the Congo. Hell, American treatment of the Philippines and Cuba was pretty brutal too.\nBarista’s regime in Havana was really authoritarian too, but the country was doing okay economically.\n\nMost of the Middle East is still extremely repressive on human rights, but most of the Gulf states are doing quite well for themselves. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE are fucking theocratic monarchies for crying out loud, and we all saw the horror stories during the soccer/football tournament last year. But have you seen how much money Saudi Arabia wastes, or looked at Dubai?\n\nThe same has been true historically as well. Ba’athist Iraq and Imperial Iran we’re clear dictatorships (and Iraqi treatment of the Kurds is still terrible). But prior to 1991 and 1979 respectively they each were huge regional economic players. \n\nThis is probably we’re I’m going to catch some flak. The Soviet and Eastern Bloc’s economy did okay for several decades, even using 3rd party numbers there was steady economic growth during most of the Cold War. That’s until their eventual stagnation, but I digress. And nobody will contest their authoritarian nature. \n\nMoving East, the PRC is the 2nd largest economy in the world. That’s after Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution, and all the other purges. China is doing okay, at least on paper, yet nobody will contest that their authoritarian.\n\nEven Western-backed countries in East Asia were authoritarian for most of the Cold War. When the South Korean economy exploded, they were cycling between various Juntas. For its short existence, South Vietnam was also doing okay economically, but was lead by a Junta during the 60s and 70s.\n\nI hope I made my point.",

  "title": "CMV: Votes should be weighted based on a competency test",
  "selftext": "The current system of liberal democracy is broken. Nearly every liberal democracy has a duopoly of political parties (usually a moderate left and moderate right party) that exist in near constant gridlock due to the constant swings of power and the unanimous focus on highly-polarized issues that may or may not have relevance to the average American citizen.\n\nMost people do not have strong ideological lean, one way or another. Most people tend to vote for one party or another for the same reason they have a favorite football team (e.g. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9831368/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9831368/)). For instance, protectionism only became part of the Republican Party when Donald Trump argued against NAFTA, and anti-Russia sentiment only became part of the Democratic Party as part of opposition to Donald Trump.\n\nAmong those that *do* have a strong ideological lean, few are actually familiar with the role of government, the separation of powers, gerrymandering, and the nature of historical and recent major Supreme Court rulings.\n\nThe issues that have arised this century include a rise in populist leaders, such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Andrej Duda, Marine Le Pen, and others. People must also remember that Adolf Hitler rose to power by using democracy against itself, defeating the system from the inside out. The National Socialist Party did not storm into Berlin with tanks and soldiers talking of killing the Jews. They did so in the ballot booths, by talking about correcting the economic course of the Weimar Republic.\n\nAdditionally, Hamas did not win the government in Gaza with guns. They won it by arguing that Fatah was weak against Israel and that the people of Gaza needed a stronger hand at the negotiation table. Look how both have turned out. Despite the suffering of people in Gaza, Hamas actually has *record* approval ([https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-palestinians-opinion-poll-wartime-views-a0baade915619cd070b5393844bc4514)). So are the people *really* voting in their best interest here?\n\nI'm very skeptical of ontological arguments for universal democracy, such as that having less voting rights makes you less human. I think, for instance, that felons are full humans that deserve every ounce of respect, despite the fact that they have been disenfranchised.\n\nNow how do we combat this? By forcing people to do their homework. What I'm proposing is a simple competency test, something with very easy questions like \"What Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms?\" or \"Who is the current governor of your state\"? These questions could be determined by a randomly-selected group of citizens. It should be nothing like the literacy tests meant to discriminate against people of color, and the random citizens who determine the questions should be determined by a nonpartisan (not bipartisan) group.\n\nThis test could be part of a system of weighting votes. For instance, if it's a 30-question multiple-choice test with four possible answers for each question, the lowest score we should expect is roughly 25%. Each question would have a weight of 1, so the lowest weight we could expect is 7 or 8. The people who do the best on the test would have the highest weight. If you want to have higher weight as a voter, do some Googling, find practice tests, and do your homework so you can look like you've done your homework. And for those of us who understand government, it gets us in a good-faith frame of mind to carry out our duty to vote.\n\nAny form of government is going to have unintended consequences, because we exist in a survival of the fittest game of life. The major parties will try to find ways to exploit this system of government for their own benefit. That's a given. Winston Churchill once said \"Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms which have been tried from time to time.\" Why not try a new one to make a less terrible form of government?",

Catfishing is wrong, and is a form of emotional abuse. Surinder should not have catfished his voice by joining her dance class by disguise. Even then, 'Raj' should not have been harrassing Tina by continously flirting with her, and giving her compliments. However, Taani is also in the wrong. She should have told 'Raj' that she was married to Surinder, instead of slowly falling in love with him, which counts as cheating, albeit not physically. The whole point of an arranged marriage is so you can slowly fall in love with your spouse.\n\nMy 2nd reason for believing so is that Taani is not even truly in love with Surinder! Tina only fell in love with 'Rahul', which was a disguise made by Surinder. He had to completely chamge his personality for her! Therefore, Tina has not fallen in love with Surinder, but Raj, a made up concept! That is not supposed to happen, and she is supposed to love him for the way he is! She even vowed to change herself for Surinder when he was supposed to love her for the way she was! He did, but she never truly realised that. This is because he does not know how to be romantic! He has such a bland personality that he is unable to be romantic!\n\nMy 3rd and final reason for believing so is that Surinder was just a backup plan for Taani to marry. He only married her because her former spouse died in a bus accident last-minute. He also had to fullfill her father's last wishes, which means that he did not marry willingly. Moreso, the only reason Taani's father asked him to marry her was because she was naive, and she would not be able to survive in this world by herself, which is a form of sexism and should not have been in a movie that was released as late as 2008; 1 year after Taare Zameen Par and 1 year before 3 Idiots; both progressive movies that are highly praised for their progressive nature and relatability.

  "selftext": "People always complain about how bad they have it compared to boomers but I am not really sure this is the case.  They say that back in the 50's and 60's good paying union jobs allowed the average joe to buy a house and raise a family on a single income, all without a college degree.  Even if we ignore the fact that these times were less than ideal for women and many minorities, I dont thing the idea holds up to scrutiny\n\nThe first most obvious thing that goes against this narrative is that people make more money today on average, even after adjusting inflation.  According to the census, he median male salary in 1960 was $5,400, which is about $56,500 a year in today's money.  Compared to today, where the median male makes over $60,000 a year.  Note I only talk about men here because I think the situation with women has changed so much that it doesn't really make sense to compare, but women are probably doing far better than they were in the 50s and 60s in terms of what they can make.\n\nBut what about college?  Isnt it unfair that young people are expected to go into debt just to get a job?  Yeah it sucks but college debt is generally a pretty good problem to have, seeing that people who have bachelor degrees make on average 1.2 million dollars more over their lifetime compared with people who dont, and this gap only widens when we add advanced degrees to the mix.  The truth is that even with rising costs of schools, getting a degree is a no brainer.  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, today, Men who have bachelor degrees make a median salary of $70,000 a year which far better than what people used to make\n\nSo why does it not feel like we are doing amazing?  Simply put, young people today spend more money.  People drive bigger cars, live in bigger houses, watch bigger T.V.s and so on.  Young people are much less likely these days to cook their own food or to repair clothes that get ripped.  Young people these days also have smartphones, smart watches, streaming services, laptops and videogames, all things that simply did not exist back in the day.  The truth is that you can still raise a family and buy a house on a typical salary these days, you just need to live like how many people in the 50s and 60s did and only own one crappy car, have a 2 bedroom house for a family of five, never eat out, never fly on a plane, and have no college fund for any of your children, but that life is not appealing for obvious reasons.\n\n  \nEdit:  Probably should have mentioned this, but to clarify, I am specifically talking about the U.S.A.",

Firstly the amount of discretion judges have is crazy. They can let someone convicted of a crime walk free or sentence them to death. People are also commonly convicted without evidence (especially people of color) and overturning a conviction can take decades, even if they have convincing evidence of innocence. \n\nThe BLM's wild horse and burro program is also not managed well.

  "selftext": "Please forgive me for this controversial topic, but after the last post I made (which I deleted as it seemed to be getting out of hand), I thought I would really get this last potentially detrimental view out there as a way of not only explaining some loose end thoughts, but also to hopefully solidify the mental changes I've been trying to make.\n\nNow, based on the title, you might be shaking your head and thinking this is all just some pill rhetoric, but before you do, let me try and explain this a little further. \n\nFor those who did not see the last post, I will be 25 in just under 3 months, and I only had my first kiss a month ago. Nevertheless, I'm still a virgin. Other details about me, in case you were curious, I am Canadian (of Iranian descent), balding, 5'6.5\", mildly autistic/asperger's, have GAD and dysthymia, and am currently in my final year of my master's degree with the hopes of doing a PhD in epidemiology/pharmaceutical sciences. \n\nNow to cut to the chase, a thought that I feel like I've had inside of me ever since 8 years ago when my mind got utterly destroyed by what was going on in high school is that some people (regardless of gender) truly are incels or involuntarily celibate. Now I'm not speaking about the really radical ones who believe in morbid things, but I'm referring simply more towards people like myself who, despite doing everything they can given their challenges, just simply cannot succeed in dating and honestly life in general.\n\nTo use myself as an example:\n\n* I obviously do not need to provide the statistics about how practically next to impossible it is for people with ASD (especially males) is to get meaningful relationships. The autism subs can explain that just fine, and I am practically a textbook case of that.\n* I'm obviously vertically challenged, which once again, do I even have to explain how much of a struggle it is not just in dating but practically life in general? The short subs can do that just fine.\n* Minority ethnicity in a predominantly white country\n* Will not become anything more than middle class given what I'm pursuing (which is also the best possible route I can do at this point).\n* I've seen 12 (including my current one) therapists, and practically none of them have been able to help me unless the external circumstances in my life were positive (which sadly didn't happen a lot of times). Some of these therapists even reinforced my bitterness towards others.\n* I've employed strategies that my social skills therapists provided (including active listening, open ended questioning, dressing nicely etc.) and guess what? Still no success with relationships and minimal success with friendships, especially given the numerous betrayals/backstabbings/ghosting/fake people I've had the misfortune of encountering in high school, undergrad, and even beyond\n* Based on personality tests, I'm also considered to be an INTJ, which unsurprisingly is the least compatible personality trait with North American society, given what I've shared and others in the respective sub have shared\n\nYou could take a couple of these traits, particularly autism, and put them into someone else and you'd see practically the same outcome. Unable to find meaningful relationships despite their best efforts. Once again, I'm not referring to the people who are clearly too far gone in their ugly personalities, but moreso for the people who may not have such personalities but still struggle and fail.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, I feel like some people have what I call \"supernatural love powers\". What do I mean by this? Well, take Mormons for example. They practically don't have to do anything above and beyond to find love and get married at a prime age, and I feel that even those with the challenges I mentioned above would still be able to find meaningful relationships by virtue of their religion, ethnic background, or social status. \n\nSo yeah, I hope this isn't too controversial, but I would not have posted this if I wasn't truly desperate to change my perspective, even if I admittedly might have some difficulty accepting different perspectives initially.

Nations and political groups have always used it to coerce people into action. \n\nHowever, the last 30 years of increasingly \"personalized\" news and social media has created more and more self-contained echo chambers that deeply benefit from hyping their specific audience's particular fears and concerns. They rely on the age old technique of blaming reliable \"boogeymen\" that are out to get them.\n\nAs the increasing economic distortion field of social media makes us feel more and more insecure about our own social and economic standing, these echo chambers tell us that we, too, would be rich and powerful if some other group hadn't wronged us or wasn't trying to destroy us. \n\nIn many (if not all) cases, there is some real injustice and, possibly, genuine concerns that ought to be addressed. However, the echo chamber serves to amplify the scope and scale of those concerns and discount or dismiss the concerns of others. \n\nThe facilitators of the echo chamber profit from their enablement leading people to go deeper and deeper into the victimhood rabbit hole. \n\nPeople occasionally peek out of the rabbit hole and see that their victimhood is not validated by others or see other people's sense of victimhood as a threat to their own desire to be the \"true victims\" who deserve attention and restitution. \n\nAny denial of their \"true victim\" identity only serves as proof of the threat from the \"other.\"\n\nThere is no truth unless it agrees with us. Facts are replaced with varying sets of \"alternative facts.\" We are told not to trust our eyes or our feelings if they counter our narrative. They claim that the conspirators of our destruction are rooted deep in every institution and they are continually working towards our demise. \n\nThere is no nuance. There can be no compromise. Every person who disagrees with us is \"in the pocket\" or \"under the control\" of \"the other.\" Every fight is another step in the existential struggle. Every slight is proof of the other's intention to destroy. Every victory is a sign of righteousness. All damage done in the name of the cause is excusable. \n\nSo... deeper and deeper we go until the only option left is the complete suppression and silencing of others who do not acknowledge our absolute and unarguable right to be validated and for our perceived wrongs to be made right. \n\nThis, to me, seems like the template for each group I interact with and I see no sign that this will change given how the echo chambers are being reinforced by the increasingly \"personalized,\" click-driven media landscape.",

I will mostly just be talking about Margot Robbie being snubbed due to “sexism” as I already understand the side of the argument that misogyny was the reason why Greta Gerwig wasn’t nominated for Best Director.\n\nMany people were surprised that Ryan was nominated for his acting but not Margot Robbie, including myself. And they responded with the unfairness by calling the Oscars sexist. This seems ridiculous. Margot Robbie wasn’t competing against her co-star. If she was, I think most people agree that the outcome would’ve (hopefully) been different. She lost to another woman. You could argue that maybe the Oscars wanted to push their narrative by “refusing to nominate the lead of Barbie”, and yet they nominated an actress who had the most controversial and progressive monologue in the movie: America Ferrera, along with the movie receiving 6 other Oscar nominations. This really just sounds like people are mad that Margot Robbie didn’t get nominated for Best Actress and calling sexism when it doesn’t make sense in this case.\n\nI’m willing to believe that the Oscars are sexist as I’ve disliked these awards for a while now. Shows and actors/actresses are constantly getting snubbed out of awards and it doesn’t seem like many of the people winning the awards deserve them. However, I still don’t see how you can make the claim that Margot Robbie being robbed out of a nomination is misogynistic.\n\nEdit: I do want to add that, based on my opinion and the opinions of others, Margot Robbie definitely seems to have been snubbed. My argument is simply that this is either due to a difference in acting preference, ignorance, or, as someone pointed out, the judges seem to favor actors/actresses that “transform” into characters. Since Margot Robbie is beautiful already, becoming a doll character isn’t too far off. (And this favoritism is unfair) I simply believe the judges snubbed her out of a nomination like they have done to many men and women in the past and is not due to sexism.",

Second, why I think this is important enough to make a fuss about.\n\n## How should they be defined?\n\n0^0 = 1\n\n0/0 = 0\n\n0 (mod 0) = 0\n\n### Why?\n\n0^0 = 1 is already almost universally accepted by mathematicians. So much so that in all fields of math, 0^0 is either defined to be 1, or left undefined. [Furthermore there are not, and have never been, any authors defining 0^0 as anything other than 1.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_the_power_of_zero?wprov=sfti1#Current_situation) \n\n0 (mod 0) = 0  \nFirst let me say, I understand that n mod 0 is left undefined for all non-zero n for obvious reasons. But for n = 0, whatever arguments you used, kinda fall apart. So it feels like it would be reasonable to take a closer look at this case. We obviously can't assign it any number with absolute value larger than zero, because we're taking mod 0, so the only number left is 0. And it extends the idea that n mod n = 0 for all n.\n\n0÷0 is an empty sum. One of the most notorious reasons I've heard advocating for 0^0 = 1 is that it's an empty product. By that logic, why can't we say 0/0 is an empty sum? There's not really as much too this one, it's mostly that 0/0 can't be defined as anything non-zero, and defining it to be zero doesn't seem to cause any problems. And it extends the idea that 0/n = 0 for all n.\n\nThis wouldn't change anything algebraically, (n/n = 1 , n^(a)/n^(b) = n^(a-b) for all n≠0 was the case before and it still is now), it's only arithmetically that things have changed. I've simply decided to fill the hole of what was left undefined.\n\n## Why should they be defined anyway?\n\n(TL;DR: it's mostly just me whining).\n\nThis is mostly my experience, but the whole reason I decided to make this post was because one line of code was just the last straw. In my code I was assuming n (mod n) = 0 for all n, which felt like a super reasonable assumption to make, but when I was testing edge cases, I got an arithmetic error. 0 mod 0 was undefined, which confused me. Why not just define it as zero? After looking into it, I didn't get any answers other than \"because n mod 0 doesn't make sense for any n\". Nothing rigorous, just the same assertion over and over.\n\nThen a bunch of arguments online started coming back to me where I was defending 0^0 being undefined when I lost my footing so-to-speak. One of the biggest counter arguments is that 0^0 *is defined* to be 1 in ℕ. So I wonder now, why can't 0/0 and 0 (mod 0) be the same? \n\nArithmetically it fill holes, and makes certain situations in programming  and higher math easier, with fewer edge cases. Any situation where it's helpful to define it as such will be much more concise, and any where it's not, we just exclude 0 anyway like we already do. In cases like programming, we have to work around these 0 cases anyway, why not just allow us the opportunity to use the special case where it's definition is useful?\n\nSo my stance is that all of the three I've listed should be true in ℝ, but I'd even be happy with those only being the definitions in ℕ.\n\n## Preemptive Arguments / What would change my mind?\n\nThe main argument I've heard is \"The Argument From Limits\". Because lim f(x)/g(x) → 0/0 ⇏ lim f(x)/g(x) = 1.\n\nAnd I agree. I never said it was. My argument was never from limits. It was just to fill the arithmetic hole of being undefined. It was discontinuous before, and it's discontinuous now. nothing has changed except I put something in the hole that was left undefined anyway. \n\nThe main counter argument I've used, and the main counter argument I expect to get is \"It will be too complicated for calculus students. Imagine trying to teach students that 0/0 is indeterminate, and also 0/0 = 0, it would be maddening for both parties\". I agree, and I believe (as of yet) this is the only valid objection. However, it doesn't quite convince me. It's mostly just a \"Student's will just have to deal with it\" kinda thing. Either they'll keep asking questions until they understand, or they'll just memorize the fact that \"if I see 0/0, it's 0, unless it's in a limit\", which isn't too complicated to memorize.\n\nIt doesn't really add any barrier to serious math, and it also is an opportunity to learn more and understand why we define operations the way we do. So I don't think this line of debate would change my mind.\n\n### What would change my mind? \n\nAny blatant contradiction caused by defining these as what I've given would certainly be enough. This would attack my ideas at the heart, and I would be forced to change my view.\n\nAlternatively, attacking the \"should be\" part of my view. If you showed that it would be far too annoying for mathematics to deal with 0 in these scenarios. To be clear, it would have to be a genuine nuisance to the day-to-day life of a mathematician, not just something where you have to add one or two extra sentences to the top of your paper each time.\n\nThese are the main ways I can think of, but I'm still open to change my mind.",

  "selftext": "I would like to start off by saying that I will block anyone who insults me in the comments or anyone who tells me to “git gud”. That’s not what this post is about and I want to be clear that this is just my opinion and I’m very open to hearing what other people have to say. That being said, that doesn’t mean I’m not going to argue back in any way.\n\nI’d also like to be clear that I’m specifically talking about the original dark souls game.\n\nSo, I love RPGs, both tabletop and video game. I find them to be a blast and when I hear that dark souls mimics old school DnD through its design philosophy, I wonder what’s not to love.\n\nI’ve always heard that these games were frustrating and punishing. So I give them a try.\n\nI first played Bloodborne which I had a blast with. There was something cinematic about it that I really enjoyed. It wasn’t just punishing in its combat, nor was it just rewarding, it was fun and had an element of escapism to it.\n\nNow enter dark souls, I enjoyed dark souls 1 for a long time. But I eventually started to realize its whole design isn’t about fun. Or at least, not what I’m calling “fun”. It’s about being rewarded. There’s a certain kind of enjoyment that comes from reward, but when the entire moment to moment gameplay begins to revolve around reward and it doesn’t compel you in any other way, it isn’t only frustrating, but reward becomes the only reason you end up playing.\n\nI’m aware that dark souls has wonderful lore and worldbuilding, but the lore and worldbuilding don’t seem present in the moment to moment gameplay. And fans reply to this by saying you’re supposed to discover it through interacting with the game, but the problem with this is that it’s again- not fun. \n\nIt feels like I’m being fed a dose of morphine every time I beat a boss. Yeah it’s rewarding but the reward goes away when you realize it’s just a video game and you actually accomplished nothing of significance. Reward is an important tool in video games I won’t lie, but when that’s all that’s there in the moment to moment gameplay, I have a hard time getting on board from a conceptual standpoint.\n\nI’m not saying that this kind of gameplay isn’t enjoyable, but it misses what’s really important, fun. If you’re not enjoying the process of beating that boss, you aren’t having fun, you’re just enjoying the experience of reward after the fact. And I won’t lie, the reward is immense in dark souls. But I’d say Bloodborne did it better in that the process of playing the game is actually enjoyable and not just the outcome of victory.\n\nOld school DnD is very much enjoyable both during and after completing a challenge. Dark souls claims to take from it, yet it’s missing the whole idea that you create a story while you play and enjoy the process of doing so.\n\nIn Bloodborne, I get this feeling of creating a story. I can’t quite explain how but the world and narrative are much more present throughout the game even if it’s not spoonfed to you.\n\nI guess my takeaway is that Miyazaki had improved the formula by the time he made Bloodborne. But I do feel as if the design philosophy had changed between games.",

  "selftext": "(Edited - By “forgiveness” I mean, you no longer feel negatively towards the individual who has wronged you.\n\nBy “heal” I mean that you “feel better”.)\n\nWhen I was a child I got jumped by a bunch of my cousins after basketball practice. One in particular got into a 1v1 fist fight with me and it had to be broken up. The coach forced both of us to say sorry to one another and shake hands. Neither of us meant it. I never forgot that and yet I don’t feel hatred towards him. But I never “forgave him” either. I am not sorry for having fought back. I don’t hate him. But I feel “nothing” towards him (which I consider a negative emotion because he is no longer positively endeared). But he was not “forgiven”. I don’t feel like that experience negatively affected my development however. I assume that means that I “healed”? Or did that not “damage me”? Because I never forgot it and it did not make me feel postively. \n\n\n“It’s always better to forgive”. \n“Forgiveness is what frees you.”\n\nI am sure that we have all heard things like this before. \n\nI do not understand how this is true, let alone why it is regarded as a universal cliche. Nor do I understand how anyone can claim that saying or thinking the words “I forgive you” actually does anything at all for one’s “inner peace”. \n\nForgiveness does not reverse a wrong.\nIt does not reverse the negative emotions that one felt at the time of the experience.\nIt does not eradicate a negative memory. \nIt does not reverse trauma.\nIt does not bring back a murdered family member.\nIt does not reverse a rape or sexual assault.\nIt is not “necessary” to heal. \n\n“Forgiving someone” has never made me feel better. And being told “I forgive you” by someone else has never made me feel anything positive if I had legitimately wronged someone that I did not want to hurt. \n\nWe don’t even actually “know” if someone actually forgives us on top of that. We can’t read anyone’s mind. You don’t actually “know” what anyone thinks or how anyone feels about you at the end of the day.\n\nI could literally argue that forgiveness is a lie that you tell yourself when you are tired of feeling negatively about something. \n\nA mere cognitive placebo effect directly proportional to one’s beliefs.\n\nAs a species that is physiologically wired to dwell on negative experiences, how exactly is attempting to exist against our nature “healing” anything at all?\n\nThe only thing that has ever made me feel positively about something that has been done to me was by enacting revenge and receiving the outcome that I wanted at that person’s expense.\n\nI am a victim of a crime. Someone did something really bad to me almost a decade ago and I spent several years after the incident planning my revenge. Meticulously gathering evidence and watching them for all of those years until successfully enacted. I enacted this plan so well that they literally couldn’t do anything at all but stay silent and leave me alone forever because it was unadulterated checkmate. Someone who caused me trauma and physiological complications as a direct result of their actions.\n\nIt had to be done. It wasn’t a want, it was a need. It was only by doing that did I truly feel like I did what I needed to do for my peace of mind and that is when I felt healed.\n\nTherefore it enrages me whenever I hear that forgiveness is necessary for one to reach that “freedom” because that’s just blatantly false.\n\nThey were literally not forgiven. And never will be.\n\nI feel free because I took my life back. By checkmating them in theirs.\n\nAbsolutely nobody was forgiven. I am healed.\n\nForgiveness is not a necessary element of healing.\n\n\n(Edited: typos)\n\n(Edited: Stating my view point blank for those who appear to be confused by what I actually believe:\n\n>Revenge can “heal” (it has healed me).\nCompassion, politeness, and kindness are not necessary to heal.\nIt is perfectly possible to hate someone and heal without ever “letting go” of that hatred.\nIt is perfectly possible to heal without experiencing a positive emotion towards the person who catalyzed a negative emotion.\nForgiveness is not a necessary element of healing. \n\n\n(Edited: Added a personal anecdote further exemplifying why I genuinely believe that revenge heals (therefore, forgiveness is not necessary to heal) so I will not have to keep telling this story again in the comment section.)",

At that point I probably wasn't attracted to them enough to date them. \nBut I find that I (F) feel strongly about my partner's legs (being strong) and hair (length, and that they have hair).

Of course most hetero men will like some curves and feminine features, but I don't fault them for that and that's subjective anyhow.

The darkness of the background forces your eyes to the brutal display of cannibalism. The  imprefect brushstrokes give it a chaotic feel, as one should feel when witnessing cannibalism. But what's also incredibly interesting is the sublte look of terror, horror and guilt in Saturn's eyes. Alsomst as if he is not in control of his actions and some outside force is forcing him to eat his son. Not only does this create a different interpretation of the original myth in Saturn's motives but it also connects to Goya's personal life. This painting is one of Goya's black paintings. A collection of paintings he made in his later years after the napeoleonian wars and after seeing the terror caused by war and the spanish inquisition. This painting his human darkness made into a painting and can have various meanings. It may also be how Goya saw himself in relation to his children as seven out of eight of his children died very young, meaning that he maybe saw himself in Saturn.\n\nAI cant do this. Maybe AGI one day but simple algorithmic AI cant paint like this. It cant create stories in it's paintings or attach meaning to it. All AI can see is a guy eating another person.\n\nThere is also the problem of skill. We as humans like to celebrate human ability and creating art requires a lot of skill. Not just physicial but mental. Creativity is a skill as well. And some pieces of art could be recreated with microsoft paint yes, but the same can be said about hoe olympic sprinters can never outrun a car, and yet they are still worthy of exaltation.

Regardless of what you think about whether this is justified or not, or how much of it is, the fact is that by far the most that men hear from this side is negativity: **what not to do** and **how not to be**.\n\nWhat men get comparatively little of, is any kind of indication of positive alternatives: **what to do** and **how to be**. If not this, then what? What is expected of us? What would be the right things to do? Sure, there are some positive narratives or role models on the progressive side, but as far as my searches show, it's a small minority. There are many on the conservative side though. The progressives hate them, but rarely offer anything in their place, only double down on the criticism.\n\nBut there is something very basic and primal about human psychology: we like the people who are nice and help us, and don’t like the ones who are mean and criticise us.

A group consisting of a human brain and the components needed to sustain it however, would, as far as my understanding goes, because it can feel pain and pleasure on its own, and it would not function while missing parts - making it the smallest entity that can experience pain or pleasure.\n\nI will define a *negative overflow* as \"the amount of pain resultant from an event that is greater than that resultant from the same event.\" Thus, an overflow of negativity. An important thing to keep in mind is that the calculation of a negative overflow should mot be concerned only with immediate effects. For example, if the event of poisoning a river will cause pain in the far future, that pain is resultant of the event as well, and must be included in the calculation. A positive overflow would be vice versa.\n\nI will define a *positive overflow floor* as \"the positive overflow experienced by the experiencer experiencing the lowest positive overflow.\" \n\nNow that those terms have been defined, I believe that every ethical conflict can be solved by;\n\nFirst, attempting to quantify the amounts of pleasure and pain in everything, in as logically as possible. \n\nThen, calculating the ratio of pleasure and pain being experienced by each experiencer in existence as logically as possible. \n\nAnd finally, attempting to steer any given event in a direction toward which there is the least negative overflow as logically as possible.

  "selftext": "While semantically investigating the aphoristic phrase, \"history repeats itself,\" may seem arbitrary as the original purpose of this aphorism is to simply state the historical cause & consequential effects that can occur in our individualized micro lives and institutionalized macro countries, I believe a poetic revision of the aphoristic saying \"history repeats itself\" would be more accurately portrayed as \"History rhymes with itself,\" because this is more precise language to illuminate the idea that history builds off its own causal events.\n\nSuch an impactful word as 'history,' is difficult to contextualize. With many micro- & macro- examples available within historical accounts and our lives, the only tangible evidence that is mutually shared among all of us would be our differences of our upbringings. Whether you had three parents, two parents, one, none, or other typical guardians, these caregivers wish to guide you (for better or for worse) to be the person that they wish to mold. At times, you may thrive or deviate from this environment; but ultimately, these foundational blocks by these guardians are what upbrings our early lives to influence the type of character that we may become in the future.\n\nHistory repeating itself may imply that the nature of a human is at a constant; although, this phrase also ignores the possibility of new inventions and concepts (that we may not know of) that may reshape society's and human's structure. For example, the rise of smartphones and social media/communication starting in the 2000s inherently shape cultural norms in the West, while creating a new genre of hobbies and careers based on an evolved median (computers) that has built off of previous technological inventions. What type of concepts from 100 years from now that may destroy our current reality of metaphysics today? History would have to build off its own technological inventions in order to create futuristic teleporters, flying cars, other Back to the Future references, etc..\n\nLastly in poetic terms, rhyming gives a predictive melody what the next phrase of the poem may say, but our predictions may be one or two letters short of the actual outcome. \n\n\"I was having a ball throwing shit against the stall!

  "selftext": "This is related to the other post on AI generated art. I saw some people commenting the argument, well if you were told your favorite art was generated by an AI, why would that decrease its value? It's the same exact art as you found meaning in moments before. I personally think it does, and this is why.\n\nThe truth is, this phenomena happens all the time when it comes to art created by humans. One example is the book Wicked Saints by Emily Duncan, which has been criticized for its anti semitic portrayal of a character and racism. Initially, a lot of readers had brushed it off or ignored it, but after news came out of the author's past bullying towards poc, some people had lowered their ratings and mentioned the news as the reason why they had done so. Technically, it's the same book before the news came out and after the news came out. And yet, people saw the book differently in the two time frames. The reason for this is, before, people saw the racism and thought it was just a coincidence and didn't pay attention to it. After, people saw that the racism was likely intentional, and reflective of the author's own viewpoints. A similar phenomena happened with JK Rowling's Ink Black Heart. Had people not known it's JK Rowling, they would likely have a different reaction than the fact it is.\n\nOverall, I believe it is a similar logic when it comes to AI art. For example, when I read Tim O Brien's book about his experience during the Vietnam war, I was incredibly moved by the feelings of sadness, anger, and guilt. If you then told me after I finished the book, that actually O Brien never fought in the war, and he was just imagined those feelings, the meaning I gained from that book would change. If you were to tell me that actually, it was an AI that wrote the book, how I see the book would change again. To me, part of why I liked the book originally was because the experiences described in it were real. When O Brien wrote the book, he wasn't simply writing a story, but about his own emotions and memories. If they weren't real, I will not like it as much even if the AI had written an identical book. Since AI only operates on data and algorithms, they do not feel human emotions or have human experiences, which I think is what makes art meaningful.",

I acknowledge that my opinion may have its flaws and I'm open to changing my view through this discussion.\n\nThe crux of my argument lies in the addictive nature of gambling. Despite my own positive experiences, I can't overlook the broader social harm caused by gambling addiction. This addiction often leads to financial ruin, mental health issues, and strained relationships. It's a societal problem that exploits hope and frequently results in despair.\n\nAdditionally, the corrupting influence of gambling, especially in sports, is a significant concern. Betting on outcomes can lead to match-fixing and compromise the integrity of sports. This corruption isn't limited to sports; it extends to political and financial systems, where decisions can become distorted by a gambling mentality.\n\nMoreover, the societal costs of gambling, such as increased crime, loss of productivity, and healthcare expenses related to addiction, are substantial. These costs often overshadow the revenue generated by the gambling industry. While I have personally benefited from gambling, I am aware that my experiences don't negate the broader negative impacts.\n\nI understand that my stance might seem contradictory, and I'm open to hearing different perspectives on this issue. Perhaps there are aspects of this topic that I haven't fully considered, and I am willing to adjust my viewpoint based on new insights.",

  "selftext": "NOTE: I would just like to point out how this post (made by a black woman https://www.reddit.com/r/blackladies/comments/hlj74l/should\\_i\\_give\\_up\\_on\\_black\\_men/) expressing a similar sentiment, was met with compassion and understanding for her experiences by black women, while mine was met with accusations of racism. Just thought that was funny \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to start, dating is already hard and it seems like there's often an inherent dehumanization aspect to it which causes people to not see the other person as a human past whether they want to date them or not. But as a black man, when it comes to black women, it definitely feels a lot more antagonistic.Now I have never seriously dated a black girl and that's not from lack of trying. I remember growing up I was never on the radar of black girls and would get made fun of by them because I was into 'white boy stuff'. But then around the end of high school I grew more attractive and started dating an Asian girl, and a common question that was asked was \"Whats wrong with black women\". I obviously would answer \"nothing\" to which the next question would be why I'm not dating one. Obviously the women in my family constantly reinforced that I had to date a black girl becuase this or that.\n\nI then remember when I was maybe 21, my black friend was interested in this girl so i went and attempted to introduce him to which they responded they were only interested in white guys. One day I went people watching at the club and there was a cute older black woman standing at the bar. Just watching how she interacted with black guys vs nonblack guys was so different. When black guys would approach her she was very standoffish and challenging but when a nonblack guy approached her she was open and bubbly.\n\nMost recently I made an effort to date more black women thinking maybe it's just in my head. This week alone I went on 4 dates and I remember just feeling like a clown the entire time. It wasn't fun because they were refusing to even try to have a good time, giving short answers and were making little subtle comments based on stereotypes of black men. It definitely felt like they thought I owed them something and left feeling worse off, ending 2 of the dates after less than 30 minutes. So idk what the specific reason for this is but it clearly has to do with race because this dynamic only happens when I go out with black women. Maybe it's because they're projecting stereotypes or maybe it's because I'm not 'black' enough or something. Not sure if this is something present in other communities but it seems like a common thing within the black community.\n\nI think if I was to date enough black women I'm sure I'd find a few that don't act like this towards me but at the same time what's the trade off? It feels like I would be handicapping myself in the dating world if I attempted to pursue more black women but wouldn't get a benefit that I wouldn't get from dating any other race.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCMV?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: A word",

  "title": "CMV: The higher abdunance of translated entertainment media, especially in terms of video games, is a net negative for the welfare and future of people living in countries whose native language is not English. Speaking English is a necessity in the modern world, and games help learn that skill.",
  "selftext": "I have noticed that over the years, an increasing quantity of video games are getting localized into more and more languages. Now, judging anecdotally from my Hungarian experience - the quality is likely quite horrible but it is serviceable enough to play - especially if you are not familiar with the source material.\n\nThis has the consequence that children in non-English speaking countries can consume entertainment in their native language. As someone from a country whose native language is NOT english, and said country's english fluency is rather abysmal: this is a bad thing.\n\nLearning English is a vital skill to do well in life. \n\n* Career-wise, speaking English permits you to read scientific publications (critical for being able to work in an R&D or engineering environment; but also for anyone planning on getting a university degree given your BSc Thesis requires significant literarture review - often making up 25-40% of the entire work). \n* Career-wise, speaking English enables you to immigrate to another country much more easily than if you only know your native language. This can have varying difficulties unfortunately due to immigration law discriminating based on home country, but a bosnian who speaks will have a far easier time immigrating to even somewhere like Hungary or poland than one who only speaks Bosnian. At the very least, speaking English reduces exploitation by employment agencies and bosses by giving a common language.\n* Career-wise, speaking English permits you to work jobs that require international interaction. With multinational companies, good jobs often require colaboration with teams in other countries. Lack of conversational, fluent English makes this an impossible task.\n* Personal Growth-wise, speaking English enables you to consume news directly published by journalists in foreign countries, allowing you to see how life is in that country without relying on your native media to (mis)represent the situation. This is a very common issue with rural Hungarian folk being fed outright false news about life in Germany that if they were able to even talk to german people on a forum, would be resolved.\n* Personal Growth-wise, speaking English enables you to consume material that might be banned in your country. For instance, if there's laws about \"LGBT propaganda\" with threats of fines and jail time, your only real source for such matters will be on servers outside your country's jurisdiction. This particularly applies to people in Russia, and maybe (unfortunately) one day to Hungary.\n* Personal Growth-wise, speaking English opens up the globe for socialization. You can make friends in Spain, Germany, Poland, Russia, Brazil, Japan, US and the list goes on - you get to see a far more diverse set of perspectives than if you'd only spoke your native Language.\n* Personal Growth-wise, the English wikipedia far outperforms any localized variant in quality and quantity alike.\n\nTherefore, it is clear that speaking English is a must-have skill.\nUnfortunately, as children are wont to do - they will not recognize these advantages gained by putting in the effort to learn English. They aren't fun - other than making friends in other countries  and wikipedia diving - and therefore suffer the same fate as other elementary-high school subjects.\n\nHowever, if make English a requirement to enjoy highly entertaining, engaging media? Learning English suddenly has an instantaneous reward, a tangible sense of improvement and access to that which was impossible before you improved. It gives children a motivation far more powerful than any of my earlier listed arguments.\n\nI know this out of anecdotal experience. I grew up in a rural, quite poor family - albeit with a PC and internet connection even if other things were uncertain. I engaged in \"traditional eastern european methods to acquire video games,\" and then played them until I hit roadblocks due to my lack of comprehension. So, like you'd practice last hitting in League of Legends to rank up, I worked with dictionaries and phrasebooks until I could solve quests in Morrowind, Gothic 2, KOTOR and other story & text heavy roleplaying games. Eventually, I got into playing Neverwinter Nights 2 online on heavy roleplaying servers, and I am utterly confident when I say this: If not for that, I'd probably be just like my countrypeople and barely manage to scrap together an English sentence.\n\nIf I didn't have the video game as a motivator, I'd have never put in the work. In fact, I have infamously neglected homework for all my classes. I had peers from wealthier families who received private tutoring, and yet I outperformed them when it came to English as a Second Language thanks to having a tangible, direct reason to study and then use it live. I ended up with B2 quality English by high school, and finished by high school with a C1 language certificate. Finally, my chemistry thesis was written and defended in English.\n\nThis is not an exceptional story. This is **the** archetypical story for all my friends - be they Russians, Spanish, Polish, Chilean - they have all vastly outperformed their peers regardless of their career choice (business, programming, engineering, theatre) thanks to being forced to speak English to play their much-desired roleplaying games.\n\nBy localizing video games, we are robbing the future generation of a very powerful language learning tool. \n\nTherefore, by the above argument: Localizing video games harms the younger generations of non-English countries.",

  "title": "CMV: Reddit, as well as all forms of social media as it's currently built, is inappropriate for philosophy/philosophy-adjacent conversations",
  "selftext": "My view is that despite the interest some people on here have with philosophical conversations—whether that be related to ethics, politics, aesthetics, etc.—I don't believe Reddit or any other social media platform actually facilitates insightful, novel, creative, or otherwise *good* arguments or models. This isn't to say philosophy shouldn't be more public, but rather that a lot of the conversations I see and the ways that social media makes the environment not conducive to actually well-thought-out, intellectually honest, formally and informally good discussions. \n\nFor starters, I think Reddit's upvote system can indirectly encourage arguments that appeal to popularity or the inverse. Like, it may be the case that n people believe in some proposition *p* and *p* is true or reasonable, but whether *p* is epistemically merited is irrelevant to if n people have belief in *p*; for a more concrete example, the Euthyphro dilemma in the Euthyphro by Plato—is the pious god-beloved because it is pious, or is it pious because it is god-beloved?—points out the irrelevancy of the gods insofar in explaining what piety is. The fact that the gods love piety doesn't explain what piety is. To go back to the abstract example, it is not in the n number of beliefs that makes *p* true.\n\nDoes that make sense? The point is that there is some cause for why n people believe in *p*, and appealing to the n number of beliefs doesn't explain very much beyond it having the quality of popularity; despite this somewhat trivial statement, the upvote system makes the popular beliefs popular and the unpopular beliefs unpopular regardless of the actual merit of the beliefs. It's possible that the upvote system is used to uplift reasonable, good, or well-thought out arguments or models, but it is not *necessary* that the upvote system uplifts those arguments. The upvote system is a Reddit/forum thing, but likes, shares, and retweets function similarly.\n\nThe second reason I think social media isn't a good medium for philosophy is because, from my perspective, the conversations generally don't go deep enough. \n\nWhat initially prompted me to think about this was a now 4 month old post along the lines of \"CMV: Credit scores shouldn't be in the rent process.\" The comments that stuck out to me was this belief that credit scores are reflective of your moral character (at least in regards with money) so having a low credit score means in some way you're deficient morally. (**Personally**, I think that credit scores are more indicative of financial health, but I digress.) Regardless of my personal opinions on the matter, there was more discussion about why morally deficient people are less desirable rent applicants and not about how low credit scores are indicative of moral deficiency. This is important (and an issue that's actually prevalent in academic philosophy) because if we don't explicitly lay out our assumptions, it's not going to be apparent when we're wrong. And, being wrong is the best teacher!\n\nOn the base logic level, if it is the case that accept the premise/assumption (if they have a low credit score, they are morally deficient \\[and all that entails\\]), and still show its conclusion doesn't follow—*that* person has a low credit score but not from moral deficiency but, say, bad luck in a bad economy, then the inner logician in us can reasonably infer that our initial assumption is incorrect (modus tollens). \n\nOn the metalogic level in regard to arguments using prepositions and predicates (basically, statements and statements about something else), it is the case that valid arguments have no valuations where the set of premises is true and its conclusion false. Consistency with respects to statements just means there is at least one valuation where it is true, and contra positively if there is no valuation where the statement(s) is true, it is inconsistent. I think this is relevant because valid arguments have no valuations where the premises are true and its conclusion false, but if the premises themselves are inconsistent (i.e. it's contradictory or always false), arguments with inconsistent premises *are* valid insofar as they make no legitimate claim. To that effect, if we don't go deep enough to explore our assumptions, it's possible that we're uplifting vacuously valid arguments that are well-written than well-thought out.\n\nThe crux of the issue here, though, is that social media doesn't encourage deep thinking. Outside of Reddit, it's an aggressive algorithm designed with the platform's business model in mind (e.g. the TikTok algorithm is going to send videos to keep you engaged because engagement means more seen ads and more chances to buy from the TikTok shop.) On Reddit, it's the internal cultural of the subreddit that determines what is acceptable and unacceptable, in addition to a subtle but nevertheless invasive platform design that enables constant scrolling and consumption of content. If long-form posts are frequently ignored (maybe they're not immediately gratifying or they take up too much space for more entertaining content), long-form posts will be ignored; but, deep thinking requires long(er)-form posts, so in some ways you could say that *some* subreddits discourage deep thinking. To that effect, it is possible that particular subreddits encourage/enable deep thinking and deep discussions, but it is not necessary that Reddit as a whole encourages those things.",

This also assumes that value is subjective (a person dying of thirst values a glass of water much more, and would pay much more, than another person would, etc). \n\nThe consequence of this is that corporations can only *sell* what consumers voluntarily value over their own cash. The businesses can only be as greedy as the consumers who buy from them, and vice versa.\n\nIf the balance is ever lost, it is corrected automatically. Corporations who are too greedy, and charge too much, lose market share and revenue, and must reenter the greed balance to compete.

Growing up I never had lots of friends or anything so the most consistant bonds I had were with my relatives, and especially with my biological mother, who was overbearing, and lots of aunts, and granma (my biological father would visit sometimes but was ultimately very absent), and an uncle from my biological mother's side, but I couldn't relate to him much.\r  \n\r  \nWhen I was a young boy (5-12) I remember feeling neutral with most kids my age, but feeling different from my biological older brother and not being able to relate to him. And maybe a bit with a male cousin who was my age, but I was more relaxed and neutral with him. Now, I know there can be lots of non-sexual reasons to \"feel different\" from someone, especially at a young age and having very different personalities. But I remember playing make-believe as the pink ranger, Kimberly, and even doing a feminine voice just like her when \"fighting\". My biological brother sometimes would call me out on this but I didn't care much, in fighting games I would pick guys sometimes but also female characters because I thought they looked more beautiful and agile. On one instance, I remember hearing my aunts and grandma telling my biological older brother to leave me alone and not comment on these \"feminine\" things. But my grandma would tell me to \"man up\" sometimes, and that \"the boys play with the boys and not with the girls\" when I wanted to play a lot with my female cousins and my biological sister.

And, at school, some classmates teased me about me liking other boys like three or four times.\r  \n\r  \nThe more I grew into my teens, the less I would hear comments on my sexuality, and the more masculine I felt to be honest. I got into a class group where we were like 17 dudes and 4 women so I spent a lot of time with other guys as well and became more open and stuff. Now, at 25.

  "selftext": "They say \"it is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.\" I simply believe this isn't true. Love is not a constant. It can be broken in less than a millisecond and years of love can be completely broken and forgotten. All the time you have invested in love and all of the work you put in can be stripped away in a complete instant and you will be left alone. To have loved for a significant amount of time and for it to be robbed from you means that it never really existed in the capacity that you believed it did and it was merely an illusion. Love isn't really real, it's more of a construct to help us continue pushing forward until you're left with nothing. You are much better off to continue the way you are now than to fall in love and have momentary happiness for it to end and be left worse than you were before. \n\nA 6 year long investment of a relationship that ended in complete and utter betrayal was one of the biggest wastes of time in my entire life. I gave every last bit of love to someone who, in the end, would become my worst enemy. I had my reservations even before entering this relationship because I was afraid of getting hurt. After years I let my guard down and I allowed myself to believe that love existed and it would last forever. Now that it is over, I am left with nothing. I wake up believing everything was my fault even though I was the one betrayed. I would have been so much better off and happier having not entering this relationship at all. I guess the title of this post should be more akin to \"love doesn't exist\" but I hold onto hope that there are some people in this world that find true love, but that is few and far between. For the rest of us, wasting time and energy loving others is useless. You are better off focusing on every other aspect of your life than deciding to give your all to another. I don't know if you'll be able to change my mind, but I at least hope that I can see others' perspective on the matter.\n\nEdit: \nMost of you are right. There is much more love in this world than the love for a significant other. It's not right to place all the love in the entire world in the palms of one person. While I feel as though betrayal stings every single day and the pain never really leaves, the love for others, friends, family, aren't diminished by the hands of one or two other people. It's not fair to give up on love when there are so many other aspects of love to give in the universe.",

  "title": "CMV: US Healthcare Incentives are Misaligned from Patient Interests. Patient and healthcare system agendas are at odds.",
  "selftext": "Healthcare centers are like businesses that provide products/services to repair and monitor your health. Patients shouldn't blindly trust that healthcare workers and medical facilities always have their best interests in mind.\n\n* **Services**: Clinicians such as dentists and other healthcare workers only get paid if you're (in most cases) in pain & unhealthy. It is solely a financial transactional relationship where they will only resolve your pain, restore your health, or monitor/maintain it if you can pay with insurance or out of pocket. It doesn't matter if you've seen them for years, the second you can't pay, it's over. And the more pain and health issues you have, the more money they make.\n* **Finances**: Patients do not have the specialized healthcare knowledge to recognize/detect when they're being deceived financially or oversold services they don't need (like a scam in terms of major upselling/marking up past what treatments should cost, doing extra services like X-rays or etc that they don't need, and so on). And again, the more health issues and pain you have, the more money they'd make. But even if not looking at it as negatively, it is an exchange of money for treating pain or restoring health. Think about what their incentives must be then.\n   * For example, there are many guides out there others have made on how not to get scammed by the dentist and other healthcare professionals in efforts to help minimize the chances of exploitation/manipulation there may be, including from a select few people in the medical field themselves since they know this can and likely does happen.\n* **Mistakes**: Patients do not have the specialized healthcare knowledge to recognize/detect when their clinician makes a mistake in many cases. They would rely on the clinician/healthcare worker for this information to be documented and reported to them. They also wouldn't have the specialized insurance or financial knowledge to know when something may be intentionally or unintentionally coded/billed wrong to their insurance or in an invoice.\n* **Mistakes**: Clinicians in many roles including dentists to surgeons & etc are expected to never make mistakes. It's not the same as non-healthcare jobs where if you accidentally sent an email or made grammar errors it's nbd. If they do make a mistake, it is a much higher risk for them to admit it to the patient or in general since they could potentially get sued, banned/barred from ever doing their job again in a country, etc.\n   * For example, it is not the same as a barista in a coffee store making coffee and a mistake happens where they can just remake the coffee. Or where the customer has the coffee knowledge to know the wrong coffee was made or an error in the right order was made. If a barista does make a mistake, it is easily salvageable for the product and financially, but in healthcare this isn't the case (the product may be your tooth, an organ, etc). Usually a coffee customer isn't in dire need of coffee and would have time or general understanding on its price point too for the product. And if a barista does make mistakes, they can still be a barista in that state or throughout the country.\n* **Records**: studies have found, including from associations for healthcare areas like dentistry, that insufficient recordkeeping and documentation is done at times on patients during visits. Couple this with the chances of how underreporting for mistakes can occur including in patient records, or the laws on maintenance of these records in terms of longevity and also quality. Additionally consider financial incentives where they may be motivated to have less records if not involving insurance or for some other reason, which would be harder to track cash \"under the table\" payments tax wise.\n* **Nepotism**: if studies, everyday people, and organizations in general seem to find nepotism does exist in the medical field from medschool to jobs afterwards, are you really getting the best possible treatment that's merit-based?\n* **Cottage industry**: aspects of the medical field still operate like a cottage industry, such as dentistry, orthodontists, optometry, physical therapy, chiropractors, audiology, etc. This means they're like home-based systems of production/services where service quality can vary greatly from one healthcare office to another as well as prices, tools/technology equipment, staff skills, and more.\n* **Oversight/regulation**: some medical boards provide little protection for patients (ex: injuries), NDAs from surgeons like plastic or dentists/orthodontists, medical field clinicians/people regulate each other in some cases versus independent outside parties, and more.\n* **Subjectiveness**: some medical fields are subjective where a clinician can think of one solution or diagnose X issue while another may say Y and propose a different treatment. This is true for dentists, chiropractors, and more.\n* **Services/Treatment Approval**: the No Surprises Act was developed for a reason to protect patients from surprised bills and not consented to services. Informed consent is required from medical professionals when treating patients. Yet studies have found that patients don't always understand all of the risks or costs associated with recommended treatment.",

  "selftext": "You will never get better service (on average) anywhere other than the service industry. \n\nServers/bartenders literally live on their tips. Giving bad service hurts your bottom line. A McDonald’s employee or a Dr’s receptionist could care less whether you leave happy or not. Tipping incentivizes people to be nice to each other and those who are nicer and more courteous will get paid more. This would help breed a culture where it pays to be a good person. \n\nTipping culture also means prices will be lower since businesses don’t need to rely on paying as much for employees. This helps small businesses who are struggling to keep their doors open.  On top of this, it allows you to pay for the service you receive. Don’t you get irritated when you go to McDonald’s and you get home only to find out your Coke was a Diet Coke, you ordered a burger and fries but the burger was missing cheese and the fries were cold? Ever go into the Dr office and see the receptionists ignoring you because they’re gossiping about things that happened over the weekend. These things happen all the time in every industry, but the only one that penalizes the paychecks of those who aren’t giving you a good experience is the service industry. \n\nQuite simply: You will breed a society of people where everyone is nice to everyone even if it’s fake nice, you’ll still be treated important, it’ll make things cheaper across the board with easier wages helping small businesses, and you’ll only need to pay for what you deserve to pay for. Bad services mean bad tips, so if you don’t get what you deserve, you don’t need to pay what you expect.",

  "selftext": "I have only one important caveat: that the artists who's works have been used in image set without permission deserve recompence and the ability to opt out. Once the tech was proven to be possible and successful they should have destroyed those datasets and rebuilt them with proper respect to artists and copyright owners, before releasing the models to the public. Unfortunately now the cat is well and truly out of the bag and I don't think there is any going back.\n\nWith that in consideration; I think basically everyone discussing AI art on platforms like reddit, YouTube, pixiv, etc have a strong emotional bias against the technology, and are unable to discuss its merits. Commonly when an AI image is posted you see comments calling it soulless, bad art, obviously fake art, or just generally claiming it is objectively bad. Even when the art itself is cool or interesting. It seems like even expressing a neutral opinion about ai pieces will get you dozens of replies telling you you are objectively wrong, and that you should feel bad for being interested in the tech.\n\nI wouldn't call myself an artist these days, the most artsy thing I still do is 3D print and paint miniatures for dnd. I have had an artistic background though, before pivoting my career path to trades. I foresaw myself struggling too much to make a career as an actual artist (was training to go into theatre design) and decided I just want to live easily and keep my hobbies. \n\nArt has historically been full of gatekeepers. Photography was considered similarly soulless. Then when photoshop was created it was considered cheating. Even extremely famous artists were ignored in their time because their art was 'incorrect' as such. (Think van gogh). I feel a lot of people decrying AI art don't realise they are becoming the gatekeepers here by being resistant to change.\n\nI'm not sure what else I should include in this post, feel free to ask additional stuff in the replies. I suppose my personal opinion is like this: AI tools are here to stay, and they will improve and improve in the coming years until they're as good or better than traditional methods. Combined with other artistic tools it will be used to created incredible works of art. It has also opened up a world of creativity for many people who never found a way to express themselves artistically. Many of my fellow DND players are really happy that they can make character art without having to copy something from online or commission an artist. I think there will always be a place for talented artists, but that world is going to change massively, the same way that it has since the advent of digital art tools and methods.",

  "title": "CMV: Football would be significantly better if the clock stopped between plays after the two minute warning.",
  "selftext": "My thesis: football should change its rules, so that during the last two minutes of the game, the clock stops between every down.  Better is subjective, but I'll get into what I think the purpose of football is to put it in context.\n\nFor personal context: I’m not a huge football fan; I’m just a guy who is sometimes in the same room as football fans and who ends up watching the game through passive interest and nothing else to do.\n\nI’m going to structure the argument as stated here:\n\n\\-First, I’ll establish what football is and how it works\n\n\\-Second, I’ll talk about what makes football a different watching experience than other sports, both positively and negatively\n\n\\-Third, I’ll make some statements about what professional sports are even for in general\n\n\\-Fourth (and finally), I’ll put it together to establish why the current rules for clock-stopping erode everything that makes football good and bring forward all of its problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Establishing the Basics:**\n\nA basic explanation of how football works, for anyone who doesn’t know, and also just to set a foundation for what’s coming later. As stated above, I’m not really a football guy; this is just stuff I picked up through osmosis. Football fans, if I get something wrong, please correct me.\n\nTeam A has the ball, and has 4 attempts (called “downs”) to move the ball 10 yards down the field. They move the ball by either throwing it and having a downfield player catch it, or by handing it off to someone and having them run.\n\nTeam B is doing everything it can to stop team A from getting those 10 yards. This generally involves being some combination of fast, hostile, and large.\n\nIf Team A successfully moves the ball 10 or more yards within 4 downs, they countdown starts over; they get another 4 downs to move the ball another 10 yards. Rinse and repeat until they get the ball to the end of the field, at which point they score.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Team A uses up their 4 downs without moving the ball 10 yards, the teams switch sides. Team B gets the ball and now has 4 downs to move it 10 yards in the other direction, while Team A is trying to stop them.\n\nBetween any two downs, a timer is set for 30 seconds. This is called the “play clock”, and its purpose is to prevent teams from waiting forever between their downs and making the game take an agonizingly long time. If the next down doesn’t start within 30 seconds of the previous down’s ending, something bad happens. I’m not sure what, because it never actually happens in the NFL, but I assume it’s pretty rough.\n\nSo far, so good. Now, about the clock.\n\nThe game of football takes 60 minutes to play, split into 4 15-minute quarters. Or, at least, that’s what it says on the box; in reality, the game takes between 3 and 4 hours. Some of the difference comes from the halftime break (between quarters 2 and 3) or from the shorter breaks on the first and third quartiles, but another huge chunk of that time comes from the clock-stopped time between downs.\n\nSee, depending on the way a given down ends, the clock might stop until the next down starts, while the play clock is counting down. A down ends when one of the following happens:\n\n\\-The player with the ball runs into the end of the field (called the “end zone”) and scores\n\n\\-The player with the ball is brought to the ground (confusingly called “downing” the player). This can happen as the result of a tackle from the opposing team, or as the result of the player downing themself.\n\n\\-The player with the ball runs out of grounds\n\n\\-The ball is thrown, but no one catches it, and the ball hits the ground (an incomplete pass)In the first two of the above situations, the clock keeps ticking while the play clock counts down to the beginning of the next down; in the last two of the above situations, the clock stops while the play clock counts down, and only starts up again when the next down starts.\n\nOkay, so that’s football in a nutshell. There are a bunch of special rules governing edge cases, different conditions under which the ball is turned over from one team to the other, and special point rules for field goals and 2 point conversions, etc, but for the most part, the above is the basis of the game and all the other rules are designed to facilitate that game structure.\n\n**What Makes Football Different:**\n\nAsk basically anyone who isn’t an avid football fan whether they enjoy watching football, and they’ll tell you that the game takes way too long to be exciting. You watch 3 to 4 hours of TV to see less than 60 minutes of actual playtime; compare that with a game like soccer, or even tennis, and the ratio of Entertaining Stuff to Boring Downtime is absolutely atrocious for football. No wonder so many people are bored with it; in my opinion (again, as a firmly stated non-football person), that’s football’s single biggest downside as a sport. There’s just so much time with everyone spent sitting around not doing anything.\n\nSo, then, if it’s so god-danged boring for 75% of the time you have the TV on, why does anyone watch football in the first place? In a word: drama. What football lacks in continuous watching pleasure, it more than makes up for in extreme moments of tension and dynamism. There’s no way to really measure this, but I’d go so far as to say that the exciting moments in football are probably the most exciting moments in all of team sports. One 3 second play is all it takes for the entire status of the game to get violently thrown off course. Turnarounds, comebacks, run-backs, long plays, some guy the size of a refrigerator barreling through a horde of 11 angry defenders doing everything in their power to stop him; each one of these things can happen, and then can be over, in just a few seconds. A team can be behind by 14 points and make it back into the lead in less than 30 seconds of in-game time. Football’s moments are pretty spaced out, but when a big play is made, there’s nothing else like it.\n\n**What Sports are For:**\n\nBefore I go on a rant about what happens after the two minute warning, a quick aside about why pro sports exist. It seems like all of the value that pro sport have can be traced back to entertainment. It’s entertaining to see people achieve incredibly high levels of skill; it’s entertaining to watch tense competition, unsure of the outcome; it’s entertaining to become a part of a fandom. Pro sports don’t provide goods or safety or medicine or education or social infrastructure. At their core, all pro sports exist because the rest of us enjoy watching passionate athletes push the bounds of human achievement.\n\nIn this view, the best sport is the one that is the most exciting to watch. So, when I say something will make football \"better\", I mean it'll make it a better viewing experience.\n\n**Why the clock should stop between every down after the two minute warning:**Finally, we've got the tools. Now, why should the clock be stopped between every down after the two minute warning?\n\nFor context, the two minute warning is the warning that teams are given when 2 minutes remain on the clock until the game is over. This is the “get shit done” time period of the game; if you’re behind, you better get your ass in gear and find some points before your loss is set in stone.\n\nBut, what usually happens after the two minute warning is this: the team in the lead gets possession of the ball, and then the game just de facto ends. It doesn’t literally end until the clock runs out, but because the clock only stops when a pass isn’t completed or when the ball goes out of bounds, they can just hand the ball to a player who self-downs, let the play clock run out as the game clock ticks down, and then repeat that 4 times.\n\nIt’s, like, the most horrible way for a game to end, from a viewer perspective. And it seems particularly ironic that it takes place in football. As I said above, the whole reason this game is special, the reason it’s worth watching in the first place even though 75% of the watch time is just dudes standing on some grass without anything happening, is the exciting moments. For the viewer, these moments are the absolute core of the game. And this game, which is so built on excitement, flops its way to an end with all the tension of a deflated balloon.\n\nThe entire reason I enjoy watching football is because of its capacity for drama. I never care who wins, but I (and, I presume, many other people) absolutely love the excitement of a game that is down to the wire, with the lead changing teams over and over again! Or a game where a team makes a heroic comeback, earning impossible-seeming points to re-take the lead in the final moments. These are the games that have people leaping out of their chairs in excitement and shouting uncontrollably.\n\nAnd yet, with the way the current football rules are, most football games just kind of… sizzle out. It’s sort of like Game of Thrones: it’s the most exciting and invigorating TV show you’ve ever seen, right up until the very end, at which point it just craps out and everyone leaves with a bitter taste in their mouth, thinking about how great it could have been.This is why the clock should stop between all downs after the two minute warning. This would force any team with possession of the ball to actually engage with the game right up until the end. If you’re in the lead, you’re already at an advantage, and you’ll still probably win. It’s riskier, sure, but not by a ton. But the benefits to us viewers would be huge!\n\nIn that case, why not stop the clock between every play? Well, it already takes a stupid amount of time to play a game that is nominally 60 minutes. Stopping the clock after every down would make that way worse. Enacting this after the two minute warning seems to provide a good balance between keeping the game at a reasonable level of time-sink while also ensuring that the highest-tension moments of the game aren't stomped on by a technicality in the rules about the game timer.\n\nIf you want to CMV, the most obvious things to do to me seem to either:\n\n\\-Explain why else pro football matters. If there’s some reason it’s important for football games to end this way that I don’t understand because I’m viewing sports through the lens of entertainment, I’d love to learn.\n\n\\-Explain why this current state of affairs actually provides for a good viewing experience. I don’t really see how that’s possible—sure, the fans of the team in the lead get to rejoice earlier, but there are also the fans of the team that has no chance to come back even though they nominally have 2 minutes left of game time. And I’d imagine that even some team stans feel that ending a game on a timing technicality like this isn’t in the spirit of the sport.If you can think of another way to CMV, that’s also fine; I just think the above two are the main pivot points of my argument, so that’s where the weaknesses likely are.\n\nEdit: sorry for the formatting! I actually didn't write this on mobile; I did it on the notes app, and copied it into reddit. No idea it worked out this way. ",

  "selftext": "In my opinion, western teenagers have it easier than eastern teenagers.\n\nLike almost all of you, when I go on the internet, I am exposed to a plethora of qestern cultures and atmospheres. A common theme I see is that their western education systems are not as stressful as our eastern education systems. They talk about dating, have nearly failing grades such as 70s and 80s being acknowledged as amazing grades, and have multiple chances to pass the class. However, I as an Indian, find those very simple and easy. I only have one chance to pass my final examination, which counts as nearly 80% of my grade. My tests and prelims only count for 20% of my grade. In my school, the pass mark is 20%. Obviously, I have it harder than most westerners.\n\nMoreso, imagine the amount of stress and studying an Indian has to do to get into a top college in India! 1st, they have to stufy from 6 to 7 hours per day for 2 years for either the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education or the Central Board of Secondary Education! Then, they have to study from 7 to 9 hours per day for 2 years for either the Indian School Certificate or the Central Board of Secondary Education. After that, they have to study for 10 to 12 hours per day for the Joint Entrance Examination, National Eligibility cum Entrance Test, Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering, etc, for 1 to 2 years! Chinese students have a similar ordeal. Meanwhile to get into an Ivy league college, one just has to learn a foreign language, do some social service, etc, for around 4 years! Obviously, the former is more stressful to be in.\n\nIn 2022, around 13,089 students died in India due to overstress. In South Korea, the number of students that committed suicide was 13,452 students in 2023. In China, the number of students that fell victim was \n11,296 students in 2021. Compare that with Greenland, which has only around 35 to 50 each year in the 2020s. In the France, only 300 to 350 teenagers commit suicide per year due to overstress. Therefore, we can conclude that more teenagers fall prey to overstress in eastern countries than in their western counterparts. The main reason why this occurs is the high population density in eastern countries which increases competition to get into good colleges.",

  "title": "CMV: Captain America was wrong in Avenger Civil War",
  "selftext": "I know this is an old topic but i would still like to have a go at it. I think Iron Man was right in Civil War and Captain America was just being unreasonable. \n\nSo in Avenger Civil War, the world government can no longer turn a blind eye to the actions of the Avenger and passed the Sokovia Accord which states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary. There are also provisions on the regulations of enhanced individuals but that's another topic. I also won't go into details about the Accord, rather i want to look at the general idea of the Accord.\n\nTo reiterate, the Avengers - an organization comprised of some of the most powerful individuals in the history of humanity will be placed under the control of a UN panel in which they can only act after being sanctioned by said panel. As for the implementation, i imagine it would be something like the UNSC which we currently have but without the Veto power (hopefully). \n\nFor the arguments, Iron man believed that the Accord is necessary since it will legitimize the actions of the Avenger and with official public support, there would be less damage. In other words, he wants the Avenger to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nCaptain America, on the other hand, believed that the government should not be in control of the Avenger since they could abuse their power for political gains. They could stop the Avenger from doing the right things when it is necessary.\n\nIn my opinion, Captain America's view is too idealistic and too arrogant. \n\nFirst of all, the Accord wasn't the product of the US government, it was drafted and passed by 117 nations around the world. It is effectively a decision of the world. So the argument that any single nation can use it to benefit themselves is lackluster. Also, it doesn't seem the Accord can force them to do anything, they just need to have clearance when they want to do something. So the Avengers would not become some sort of tool, rather, they would only be limited in what they can do.\n\nSecond, Cap's way of thinking that the Avenger \"always knows best\" is inherently arrogant, egotistical and authoritarian. The Avengers are not infallible, in fact, after everything, they were much more prone to error than regular people. A system must able to handle the worst situation, a system that relies on factors outside of its control like \"trust\" is inherently not reliable. What if the Avengers turn rouge? what if, to protect his friends, Cap is willing to go and commit crimes? to bust his friends out of jail? Expecting a man (no matter how virtuous) to always choose the best option for all in every case is delusional. It's the rhetoric of dictators and single-party states use: \"There is no need for regulations since I/the party always knows best and will never become corrupted\".\n\nThirdly, there is also the issue of liability. The Avenger has no authority to conduct the actions they performed in any country. What gives them the right to attack people without any warrant, without giving people their day in court? What gives them the right to main, cripple and kill people without any sort of judgment or verdict? Why can the Avengers deny people their right to due process? \"Well, because they are Hydra agents\" is not a valid excuse. What gives them the right to unleash an uncontrollable behemoth with no regard for collateral damages? They made these decisions by themselves without consulting anyone and refused to take responsibility. Also, the Avengers can't just waltz into any country and do whatever they want, whenever they want in the name of \"beating up the bad guy\". They spat in the face of all those countries they fought in. \n\nIn short, this is not a viable option for using their power for the good of the people when they apparently care more about beating up bad guys than protecting people.\n\nI know this is just a comic book movie and i agree, they can do whatever they want. I'm merely saying that if you apply that scenario to the real world, Captain America would most certainly be in the wrong.",

I think most cases of minors doing something wrong is because of their upbringing. The frontal lobe isn't fully developed until 25 (correct me if I'm wrong) and I think children should be given grace until they're 18 at the very least. Whatever crime they commit, the parents should face the legal consequences because they should've raised their child better/more diligently. If it was a case where the child was deemed insane, then obviously the kid should be sent to a facility and get help.\n\nI'm somewhat unconfident in my view because I'm not very well researched on subjects like ethics/law, so I will be extremely open to giving Deltas and conceding my argument",

However in the west only the far left and far right positions delivered by firebrands are considered the populist postion. \n\nConsider the topic of abortion. The majority of Americans support abortion to be legal under some circumstances according to the Gallup poll 51 percent believe this according to polling done in July of 2023. So why do we as society only believe that either the far right or the far left represents a populist position on the matter when their beliefs are in the minority making their postions out of the populist norm. \n\nConsider the controversy of Pennsylvania senator John fetterman recently with his unequivocally support for Israel in the current Israel hamas war. John fetterman wasn't elected by the people of Pennsylvania to support Palestinian issues. He was elected to support democracy and to prevent a nationwide abortion ban. The moderate voters who swung to him in suburban Philadelphia counties didn't care about that issue because it wasn't an issue then or they might actually support Israel. So wouldn't that make fettermans position a populist one if populism is simply supporting the ideas that your constituents want you to support. Why do people consider him compromised when he never had major opinions on palestine in the past as lt. Govenor or mayor of Braddock pa. \n\nSo why do we consider the politics of either bernie sanders and Jeremy corbyn on the left and Nigel farage and donald Trump populist when based on the definition of populism their ideas would be accepted by the minority of voters. Maybe people like them and others \"tell it like it is\" but does that make them populist based on the defiention of the word. Consider the topic of health insurance in America according to Gallup polling in January of 2023 57 percent of Americans said government should ensure some form of health coverage for all but 53 percent think the private industry should run it not the government and a majority like the affordable care act. So why is these positions not considered the populist ones and the minority of support for Medicare for all at 43 percent according to Gallup poll research. \n\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/468401/majority-say-gov-ensure-healthcare.aspx&ved=2ahUKEwiLoauTl_KDAxUuFVkFHV6VBz8QFnoECA8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw39_eHA5m-VigKWdcCGH-w2\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://news.gallup.com/poll/321143/americans-stand-abortion.aspx&ved=2ahUKEwjN7raelPKDAxX9EFkFHQTCCtAQFnoECBAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3AnH1PcbRG2GIeTuKtKsZr",

  "selftext": "I'll state my case and then preemptively defend myself, so if you're going to comment, read it all.\n\nWhen you're teaching something, you have to know what you're actually teaching, in depth, to be able to give someone the knowledge. As someone who educates the juniors in my team at work, I find that I can't really explain something until I fully understand it, and I can't fully understand it without hands on experience. \n\nI'm infinitely more knowledgeable, working now, than I was fresh out of college, when really, I knew just some theory. I imagine going into teaching at that point, and I can't help but feel I would've been a very uninspiring teacher, because I think kids really pay attention when they understand stuff, but lose interest when they don't, and feel like they never will \"with this fucking teacher\". Most teachers have no/minimal experience with their subject, so how can they be of any use? \n\nMath is a good example of a subject that really needs to be taught from ground up, and with historical context. It's also important to show kids the actual real life application of math. Yea, most math teachers just tell you some formulas. No wonder math is stereotypical \"the worst\" and \"I hate it\", because it probably requires one of the highest degrees of preparation before being taught, beyond just theory.\n\nAnyway you get the gist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Clapback 1: \"But knowing and being an expert doesn't translate into being a good teacher that can convey information\"*\n\nI don't think there's a universally recognized good way to make people good teachers. If you think that's what the pedagogical module is for...lmao. It's mostly just a waste of time \"you pass, get out of here\". Granted, I didn't finish it, but I still attempted it. \n\nPeople can train their teaching ability but I feel like some people are more interested about it than others, some people have better social skills, and that matters too. There are many factors. I feel like the ability of being able to teach well is spread throughout the population. Just because you're a teacher doesn't mean you can teach. Just because you work at a corporation doesn't mean you can't. \n\nSo who would you rather have teaching you? A good teacher with real life skills? Or a good teacher without real life skills? Keep in mind, most teachers aren't good teachers, and don't have real life skills. And people wonder why education is so bad.\n\n*Clapback 2: \"You mentioned math, but for some other subjects what you said makes less sense. What about foreign languages?\"*\n\nWhat about them? If you work as a translator (of books, live), or editor, etc. you will probably know more regardless, and get in contact with the culture as well, which is important. Still WAY better than learning a language and going straight into teaching after college.\n\nI don't think that there's a subject where teaching isn't greatly improved by hands-on experience for years and decades.\n\n*Clapback 3: \"Ok, so then who is gonna teach the children?? Someone has to, dismissed.\"*\n\nSomeone like me who isn't considering teaching, because it pays so bad (and other reasons: in my country at least you also have to deal with politically placed school directors for instance). It pays bad, because it's so easy to become one and the quality filter is non existent (yea, someone had to say it). But I would gladly teach for a couple of months, as a break from what I do. And I'm sure A LOT of people would. \n\nThere could be a system where people sign up for a class for just a semester. Or other systems, who knows.

For example, Vine was a social media site that ran from 2013 to 2017 where users would upload 6 second clips of themselves. This gave birth to equally unintelligent memes to modern day 'brainrot'. Popular ones include; a girl saying \"Asian people are-\" before wheezing, \"so I was sitting there, barbeque sauce on my titties\", a kid wearing his hood behind his ears, and equally nonsensical videos. These videos are widely seen as iconic.\n\nIn the early 2010's (or arguably the late 2000's), the memes were just as foolish. There was a popular branch of memes at the time known as 'Major League Gaming' (MLG) that encompassed; a hooded man saying \"fuck her right in the pussy\", a very poorly drawn Sonic the Hedgehog ('Sanic'), an old guy saying \"wow\" before winking, a kid shouting \"oh baby a triple\", another kid saying \"I like turtles\", Mountain Dew, Doritos, everything being Illuminati - yet the older side of 'Gen-Z' and everyone else above want to bag on the new generations of memes for making no sense? it's hypocritical.\n\nBrainrot has been around forever.

The cost of hired security to curb it just ends up getting passed on to the customer (or, oftentimes, the taxpayer in the case of actual police involvement). I’m also tired of seeing edgy internet leftists (I am considerably left of center) engaging in apologism or even outright endorsing it as a means of leveling the playing field. All it does it foment further decay in social trust, enforce stereotypes, and make it harder for small businesses to survive. It’s not only lazy and morally wrong, but also a particularly shitty tactic if you want to actually improve the lives of the poor in a meaningful and enduring way. Actions have consequences, and even if it were entirely decriminalized (for the record, I don’t support jailing nonviolent shoplifters), it still leads to bad outcomes for everyone involved.\n\nEdit: A lot of similar responses, so will address collectively: in a true ‘survival’ scenario, where failure to shoplift would result in imminent starvation, I cannot rightfully condemn the individual.\n\nTo assert that this edge case is representative of the typical shoplifting incident is where I am going to push back, and is the kind of view I commonly see on Reddit which in large part inspired the post to begin with. In the overwhelming majority of cases, one or more of the following is true which would render the action immoral: 1.) the item stolen is not strictly a survival necessity (eg designer clothing or footwear); 2.) the shoplifter has spent a sum of money that could cover a necessary purchase on an unnecessary purchase instead (eg buying lottery tickets and stealing food); 3.) food banks or other philanthropic initiatives are available to procure a substitute product. In the unlikely circumstance where all of these are false, then an individual act of theft could possibly be condoned, but it would nevertheless reflect a pressing need for social action to address these issues as a more effective response than to normalize theft.",

I certainly never say I know better than the millions of voters who do collectively decide on policy. \n\nStop strawmanning. Me being able to recognize my relative powerlessness in a political system does not at all correlate to wanting more power.

Im talking just graduated, Investment banking/Corporate Finance/Portfolio Management/Private Equity analysts are making 200,000+ and idek if that includes bonuses and all that. That beats engineers as well as IT pretty soundly. These are 22 year olds making more than a 50 year old doctor in some cases.\n\nSecond, I believe even the more readily available jobs for business major make waaaaaay more than others. I know people who:\n\nWent into teaching needing a second job with nearly 10 years experience.\n\nWent into architecture for 7 years of study with a PHD making maybe 60,000.\n\nWent into chemistry with a 3.5 GPA and is unemployed or barely making over 50000 with no benefits.\n\nWent into med school and is now a ~~slave~~ resident with crippling student debt.\n\nMeanwhile douchebag Joe who spent college roofieing girls with his 2.5 GPA went into commercial credit and is clearing 160,000 at 30 years old. His boss who was in the same frat is clearing 300,000 plus with just a bachelors. You can go into commercial credit at like any bank and move up from there easily with no further education. Seriously go to r/financialcareers and you see hella people with just a bachelors pulling in doctors wages. \n\nThird of all business majors seemingly have the highest ceiling for potential career earnings with basically little to no need for continuous education (unless you count spending their MBA doing coke in Cabo). I get doctors studying their ass off to make maybe 400,000, but you get Private Wealth Managers, Managers and Directors making the same with an MBA and sometimes not even that. Also as a doctor you make up to maybe high six figures and thats it. With an mba you can be some hedge fund dude who pulls 500 million in a year.\n\nIt just seems like business majors dont need to try really hard in their studies compared to other majors and have a seemingly stupid high pay ceiling with almost no need for continuing education. At this rate why does anyone go into anything except business.",

  "selftext": "To be clear, I do think harassment is a serious problem affecting both men and women. I'm not trying to minimize anybody's trauma here. Many men/women have been harassed by other men/women and that's not at all Ok. \n\nBut one of the things that bothers me about the way we currently talk about sexual harassment is that it's often \"did this person make you feel uncomfortable or not\" and not \"was this behavior objectively inappropriate.\" \n\nIf I'm walking behind somebody in a dark alley at night, they may very well feel uncomfortable. But I don't face consequences for that because it's generally recognized that the person I'm walking behind might feel uncomfortable even though I didn't do anything problematic. Same thing if the roles are reversed. \n\nThat doesn't seem to be the case with workplace harassment. And the problem I see with that is that a myriad of factors will make a particular behavior seem more/less threatening even if the behavior is the same. For example, looks, fashion or lack of fashion, whether the other person is unkempt or not, mannerisms, and anxiety. \n\nIf there was a list of behaviors that could be considered inappropriate, people would know whether their behavior was in line or out of line. If they behaved in a way that was within guidelines they wouldn't be punished. If they behaved in a way that was not in the guidelines they wouldn't automatically be punished, but they could be if it made the other person uncomfortable. And men and women who interacted in a way that is in line with the guidelines could feel confident that there won't be consequences.  \n\nThat's my view but I'm open to hearing other thoughts.

At such levels, in addition to psychological reactions, hearing damage is a risk (depending on the level and duration of exposure), and there have also been reports of migraine, vomiting and loss of equilibrium [160]. Handheld prototypes have been reported generating pulses of sound of 1 s duration at 125–150 dB re 20 μPa, with ‘the capacity to knock people off their feet’ [159], but any proven effectiveness might well rely on auditory effects rather than radiation forces, which would be too weak (§4b).\"\n\nto make matters worse these devices cause tinnitus and apparently tinnitus is amplified by stress created by the tinnitus -.-.

  "selftext": "As harsh as it sounds I really do think it’s necessary. Nobody stumbles into the life of being a serial rapist. It’s not like some sexual assault cases where there’s some, if not nuance, then grey area. To be clear, the assault happening is unjustifiable and wrong no matter what, but the college frat boy who rapes a girl while she’s passed out at a party is different from a predator following a woman to her job, her gym, her house, waiting for a moment to kidnap her and get his rocks off. More time, planning, obsession and in some cases violence go into the latter type of offender.\n\nThe frat boy, in most cases I’ve seen, is opportunistic. They want sex. They’d prefer it consensually but if the girl is drunk and too fucked up to say “no” they’re fine with that too. Serial rapists however, they get off on the lack of consent. They get off on the resistance. They want the person to scream, fight and try and run. Domination is inextricably bound up with their sexual desire. \n\nDid anybody watch The Last of Us on HBO? Well, there’s a character just like that in the show. Someone that gets off on resistance. Someone like that can’t be reformed, retrained or redeemed. They’re wild dogs. And even if you could “tame” them, it’s still too risky in my opinion. A drunk who relapses will likely hurt themselves, either via alcohol poisoning or just your run-of-the-mill self-destruction of their lives. A junkie will likely be the same. Though the risk they betray a friend or family member and rob them for a quick fix is also a factor. They too are more likely to just OD and die.\n\nA serial sex offender though? If they relapse someone is getting raped.\n\nThat risk is too much for me. Humans are animals, no? If an untrained/abused/mentally ill dog bites two or three kids, not matter how much their owners might love them, they’re getting put down for the benefit of society according to the state. Even if you could put them on meds or put them in a different environment there’s always the risk that down the line something could set them off and then it might not be a bitten kid you’re dealing with but a dead one. I feel like this is a happy medium for the criminal justice reformers and the tough-on-crime crowd. Because when the offender is “fixed”, we release them from prison free of the “urges” that would make them want to attack someone again, we save billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on feeding and housing them, and the “law and order” crowd can sleep soundly knowing these guys are castrated and, though they’re free, will remain on a list for the rest of their lives.  \n\nSo what do we think?",

I feel that America puts a specific pressure upon men to create a society where men are put in an arena to fight for their own survival, and to prove to women that they can survive.

  "title": "CMV: Alimony should be abolished.",
  "selftext": "Please read the entire post before commenting, if you have something to say and then you read my entire post, you may be surprised to discover that I already addressed the point you were going to make.\n\nRemember, alimony is different from child support. If a couple breaks up and one person gets custody of the child, it makes logical sense for the non-custodial parent to be forced to pay child support to the custodial parent. \n\nAlimony is money you pay to your ex-husband/wife. This can happen, even if you never had any children. \n\nI believe that alimony should be abolished. \n\nHere are my reasons. \n\nReason #1: If you can end a marriage at will, you should be allowed (legally) to abandon financial responsibility at will. \n\nThis day in age, we are lucky enough to have no fault divorce. No fault divorce is a good thing. \n\nOnce upon a time, getting a divorce required both spouses to be present. That creates a problem if one spouse wants a divorce and the other does not. You also had to establish fault. In my radical opinion, filing for divorce should not require fault to be established. Amicable divorce is a real thing. Some couples split because the wife wants to have more children and the husband does not or because the husband realised that he was gay. If you want different things, or one spouse has a sexual orientation preventing him or her from being attracted to the other spouse, you should not remain married. Some couples split because of irreconcilable differences. In those cases, both spouses believe that they are right. How do you establish fault then?\n\nBefore the institution of no fault divorce, many domestic abuse victims became trapped in abusive relationships, because domestic violence was not grounds for divorce in many states ( https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/28/legislature-divorce-reform/99749172/ ). Read chapter 12 of “Marriage, a History. How Love Conquered Marriage” by Stephany Coontz. \n\nIn 1969, Ronald Reagan, who was the governor of California, implemented no fault divorce, a concept that rapidly spread to other states ( https://www.nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/the-evolution-of-divorce ). Following the implementation of no fault divorce, the overall happiness of the population improved and suicide rates decreased dramatically ( http://www.worldlii.org/int/journals/lsn/abstracts/481447.html ). \n\nOpponents of no fault divorce worry that divorce is bad for kids. I would argue that it is better for a child to come from a broken home or have their divorced parents share custody of them than live in a home with parents who do not want to be married to one another. This hypothesis is born out of empirical data. There is over whelming evidence that children experience severe stress and anxiety when surrounded by constant parental conflict and frequently experience relief when their parents separate ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-divorce-bad-for-children/ ). \n\nThat is why divorce rates rose in the early 1970’s. It wasn’t because society was crumbling. It was because divorce was finally available to those who really needed it. \n\nDo you agree with me that no fault divorce is a good thing? If not, I am willing to hear the argument. If, however, you do agree with me that no fault divorce is a good thing, then you cannot have it both ways. You cannot end a marriage at will then demand that the financial obligations keep coming after the marriage ends. If you believe that the government has no right to prevent you from ending your marriage, you cannot turn around and say that the government has a duty to force your spouse to support you. Your spouse choosing to support you should be a private thing between the two of you. \n\n\nReason #2: Being paid by your ex-spouse after the divorce is like being paid by your employer after losing your job. \n\nAfter losing your job, your former employer is not required to keep paying you. Therefore, after a divorce, you should not be required to keep paying your spouse. You may be thinking that severance pay is a real thing. However, let’s keep three points in mind. \n\nPoint #1: \n\nSeverance pay is not required. \nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=Severance+pay+is+not+required.&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIICAEQABgWGB4yDQgCEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgDEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgEEAAYhgMYgAQYigUyDQgFEAAYhgMYgAQYigXSAQczMDVqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 \n\nPoint #2: \n\nAlimony has no time limit in some states. Depending on where you live, you can be required to pay alimony for the rest of your life ( https://www.cga.ct.gov/2014/rpt/2014-R-0036.htm#:~:text=Connecticut%20law%20does%20not%20set,indefinite%20or%20lifetime%20alimony%20order. ). In the state of Florida, there is a law that says alimony can last no longer than half the length of the marriage ( https://www.tampafamilylaw.com/divorce-family-law/alimony-spousal-support/florida-alimony-bill/#:~:text=Mid%2DTerm%20Marriage&text=Just%20like%20a%20short%2Dterm,paying%20ex%2Dspouse's%20gross%20income. ). Even at companies where severance pay exists, it is never the case (that I know of) that severance pay can last a lifetime or even that it is required to last half the amount of time you spent working at the company. \n\nPoint #3: \n\nComparing alimony to severance payment works, only if the person who initiated the divorce is the one paying the alimony. If the person who initiated the divorce is the one receiving alimony, that is analogous to your employer being required to pay you even after you have quit your job. Generally speaking, severance pay is not given to those who leave a job voluntarily. \n\nReason #3: You could (and I would argue should) get a job and receive government support in the meantime. \n\nAlimony was created in a time when women had very limited job options, and so alimony was just about the only way for a divorced woman to make ends meet. That is not the world in which we live today. Today, women account for almost half of the workforce ( https://www.bls.gov/blog/2017/12-stats-about-working-women.htm#:~:text=Women%20are%20Integral%20to%20Today's,three%2Dquarters%20of%20the%20workforce. ). \n\nIf you are unable to work, then you can and probably should receive disability benefits. If, however, you are capable of working, then just do that. You can receive welfare benefits in the meantime. Universal Basic Income also sounds like a pretty good idea ( https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc?si=EIhJYmknnX6_I0FO ). \n\nImagine that your spouse asks you for a divorce. You get down on your hands and knees and beg your spouse not to divorce you. You make every promise you possibly can to change and improve the marriage, but your pleas fall on deaf ears. \n\nIn this situation, if your spouse has to receive government benefits in order to make ends meet, you will have to support your ex-spouse through your tax dollars. However, every tax paying citizen will have as much financial responsibility to your ex-spouse as you do. This makes logical sense, as every tax paying citizen had as much say in the decision to end the marriage as you did. \n\nReason #4: For as long as alimony exists, you could be rewarded for destroying your marriage.\n\nIf the lower earner cheated and that was the reason for the divorce, it would not be right to force the higher earner to pay alimony to the person who destroyed the marriage through infidelity. \n\nGold digging has always been a thing. There have always been people who value their partners exclusively for their money. Alimony takes gold digging to a whole new level. Not only is the higher earner valued exclusively for his or her ability to provide financially, the higher earner is more useful to the lower earner after the divorce than he/she ever was while the couple was together. \n\nReason #5: If you were abused physically and feel you are owed reparations, those reparations do not need to take place in the form of alimony. \n\nThe argument in favour of alimony that may be on your mind is physical abuse. If you abused your spouse physically, then you should be forced to pay reparations. \n\nObviously, being forced to pay reparations to someone you have abused makes logical sense. This does not need to take place in the form of alimony. I am pretty sure there are laws that allow you to sue someone for assault. \n\nReason #6: If we go off the logic that you deserve to be compensated for the sacrifices you made during the marriage, then this should not be specific to married people.\n\nHere is one hypothetical I hear a lot from those who support alimony. \n\nImagine your spouse supports you through medical school and you become a rich doctor. Many proponents of alimony argue that, after the divorce, you are entitled to your ex-spouse’s money, because your ex-spouse would not have been able to make as much money as they did if it weren't for you supporting them. \n\nImagine your aunt lets you live in her home to save money while you attend medical school. If you become a rich doctor, should you be compelled by court order to pay your aunt some of your money? No legal precedent that I know of allows this hypothetical aunt to take her niece or nephew to court and demand money from her niece or nephew. \n\nSuppose you have kidney disease and someone gives you a kidney. If it weren’t for this person, you would be dead. If you become a doctor, should you be compelled by court order to give money to the person who gave you a kidney? \n\nReason #7: If you wish to receive money from your spouse following the divorce (and especially if you want it to be mandatory) you should ask for a contract that says so. \n\nIf you decide to take time off of work so as to make sacrifices for the marriage, you know that being divorced and no longer having monetary support from your spouse is a real possibility. You ought to get a contract signed stating that your spouse will have to support you after the divorce, if that is what you want to happen. \n\nAs it currently works, if you wish to get married and you do not want to have to pay alimony in the event of a divorce, you have to get a prenup signed, which specifies that no alimony will be paid in the event of a divorce. Some people feel awkward asking for a prenup, because it sounds like you expect the marriage to fail. If one person feels that the expectation to support your spouse should end when the marriage ends while the other person wants to receive monetary compensation following divorce, the latter is the one who should be placed in the awkward position of having to talk to a lawyer and get a contract signed guaranteeing that you will get what you want in the event of a divorce. That is because the latter is the one who feels entitled to someone else’s money and the former is the one who believes that you should have to stay married if you want to continue receiving support from your spouse.\n\nReason #8: There is nothing wrong with both parents working. \n\nOne of the reasons behind alimony (though it certainly is not the only reason) is that, in a lot of marriages, one spouse goes to work while the other stays home with the kids. In theory alimony is supposed to be there to ensure that the homemakers has a way to makes ends meet in the event of a divorce. \n\nI would argue that, if you are worried about the possibility of having no way to support yourself following a divorce, the best thing to do would be to simply have both spouses work during the marriage. There is no empirical data, that I know of, to suggest that having one parent stay home with the kids is even beneficial, let alone necessary. \n\nStatistics show that, on average, working mothers are happier than stay at home moms.\nhttps://www.psycom.net/depression/depression-in-women/stay-at-home-mom https://www.parents.com/parenting/moms/stay-at-home-mom-depression-is-real/ https://www.metroparent.com/parenting/advice/stay-home-moms-depressed-angry-sad-study-says/ \n\nMen fare better when mentally and physically when care taking responsibilities are shared in a relationship ( https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/797597 ). Couples with a female bread winner report more happiness ( https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/08/study-shows-husbands-whose-wives-out-earn-them-are-happier.html ).\nRaising a child costs $233,610 from birth to age 18 ( https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/01/13/cost-raising-child?fbclid=IwAR2NgNz74eHTl8x7nY2OMp6JdOzP_tbqWGrZtWyeIwzteZ264n-5XM7pB4s ). The annual cost of living in most U.S. states in between $55,000 and $73,000: https://www.gobankingrates.com/making-money/economy/rising-cost-of-living-in-america/ The median household income as of 2020, is approximately $71,000: https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+the+median+household+income+in+the+united+states&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=what+is+the+median+household+income+in+the+united+states&aqs=chrome.0.0i512l3j0i22i30l7.10249j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\n\nBased on the statistics listed in the above paragraph, I would say that the chances of being able to make ends meet are greater if both parents are working.\n\nWith a high number of families with both parents working, there will be a need for babysitters. This will offer job opportunities to those willing to perform the job of babysitter.\n\nReason #9: Most people have friends or relatives with whom they can stay. Those who do not ought to hold down a job. \n\nImagine that you get a divorce and you are the lower earner. Now imagine that, after the divorce, your sister and brother-in-law let you live with them. You have no financial responsibilities. In that situation, you should not need alimony to meet your basic needs, yet the current system would still allow you to take your ex-spouse to court and demand alimony. The vast majority of people have that option. The few people who do not have the option of staying with a friend or relative should not quit working. They should instead be holding down a job the best they can. \n\nReason #10: What if the homemaker was incompetent and did not serve their spouse?\n\nImagine one partner goes to work while the other stays home and takes care of the kids. The homemaker can just abandon his/her responsibilities at a moment’s notice. It is only fair that the breadwinner be able to abandon his/her responsibilities at a moment’s notice. \n\nLet’s address an argument that is likely to come up. The sacrifices that the homemaker made enabled to breadwinner to advance in her or her career, it is only fair that the homemaker be compensated for those sacrifices. What if the homemaker did not exactly make those sacrifices? What if the homemaker never cleaned anything, the house was always a mess? What if the homemaker was constantly feeding the kids MacDonald’s, due to being too lazy to prepare the kids a home cooked meal? What if you are a stay at home mom/dad with a nanny and a house keeper. In that situation, I do not think that the home maker really sacrifices in the same way that the bread winner did. \n\n\nedit: In my original post, I made a point about the supposed bias against men in the court system.\n\nWomen are overwhelmingly the ones who receive alimony ( https://farzadlaw.com/divorce-statistics#:~:text=Nearly%2098%25%20of%20people%20receiving%20alimony%20are%20women. ).\n\nOne commenter did well to entertain the possibility that maybe the rates at which women receive alimony and the rate at which men pay it is due to the fact that there is tremendous pressure on men to be providers and women are more likely to have to take time off of work because they need to recover from pregnancies. Whether or not the system is actually biased in favor of women, I am not sure, but that really is not the point. I edited out the part about gender bias, not just because I am unsure if the gender bias in the court system really is as common as the media will have you believe, but also because it does not matter. You do not need to make the case that the courts are biased against men to make a good case against alimony.",

  "selftext": "This post is created as a response to the ever present and annoying Tom Brady haters that are obsessed with tearing down a person that they don’t know or cares about their existence. They take any opportunity to praise Mahomes as so “unlucky” in his career while talking about how many breaks Brady has gotten in his playoff career. Here’s an example from @barryonhere on X:\n\n“A teammate fumbling the ball out of the back of the endzone for an opponent touchback NEVER happened to Tom Brady ONCE in 381 career starts btw.”\n\nThis is one particular stat. For a more general look at Luck, let’s go through Mahomes playoff resume, shall we?\n\n2020 Divisional Round: Chiefs go down 24-0 against the Texans early on. However, due to Bill O’Brien’s idiocy and the Texans falling apart on both sides of the ball, the Chiefs are able to come back and win.\n\n2020 AFC Championship: The 9-7 Titans knocked off the 14-2 Ravens in the previous round, making the Chief’s route to the Super Bowl much easier. \n\nSuper Bowl 54: Patrick Mahomes threw two interceptions in the first three quarters of the game and was narrowly able to muster another comeback due to Kyle Shanahan choking and Jimmy G falling apart. Many missed penalties also.\n\n2021 Divisional Round: Mahomes went down but the defense clutched up against Mayfield.\n\n2022 Divisional Round: After Buffalo scored with 2 minutes left, Tyreek Hill had a massive miracle touchdown. After Buffalo scored again, KC went down the field in less than 13 seconds due to terrible defensive playcalling. The coin toss. May I say more.\n\n2023 AFC Championship: This game went down to a hit out of bounds getting KC into field goal range. Very questionable reffing also.\n\nSuper Bowl 57: James Bradberry and excellent Special Teams play.\n\n2024 Wildcard: Defense holding the #1 ranked offensive to 7 points in freezing temperatures.\n\n2024 Divisional Round: Multiple deep passes by Allen dropped by his receivers, missed 44 yard field goal in final 2 minutes to tie the game.\n\nAs you can clearly see, there has been incredible luck present for the Chiefs to have the runs they’ve had, nearly as much as the Patriots had in their first few Championship runs. You can apply this logic to any other Dynasty, whether the Bulls, 49ers, Cowboys, Lakers, etc. Anyone peddling these arguments against one athlete or team has a personal vendetta to grind.",

  "selftext": "EDIT: I was misinformed, it was not replacing it, just played alongside! I don’t think this is a big issue anymore, but I’m leaving the post up because there is interesting knowledge in here. Original Post as follows:\n\nTL:DR - I don’t feel like the National Anthem is problematic, and it is a long cultural tradition. Why should we replace it? (Especially when it will piss a lot of people off for seemingly little reason). It’s one thing to play this other national anthem alongside, another to replace the old one.\n\nSaw on here that they are replacing the National Anthem this year at the upcoming football games with the “Black National Anthem” (Lift Every Voice).\n\nI’m very liberal, but this feels kind of weird to me. It’d be one thing to sing this alongside The National Anthem, but it feels way over the line to replace this.\n\nI don’t feel a change like this is necessary because the National Anthem isn’t really even a problematic song. If anything, it’s a bit dull. But at any rate, it’s a tradition, and long traditions that don’t harm anyone or imply anything negative should be generally respected.\n\nI don’t really like the Lift Every Voice song either, because of the religious implications of the song, which (in my opinion) actually add problematic layers to it (think pledge of allegiance). It also doesn’t feel like it’s significant culturally. Is it even significant to black people? Aren’t there other folk songs that are more significant to black people? I truly don’t know.\n\nI don’t call many things virtue signaling, but this feels like very weird virtue signaling to me. I don’t quite understand the point. It seems like a change that will piss a lot of people off for very little reason. Not all traditions are bad, or imply systemic white supremacy.",

  "selftext": "I anticipate a lot of semantics around what “better” means, and I'm deliberately leaving that up for interpretation/discussion.\n\nYou hear these debates a lot across every major sport, but in my experience it's biggest in basketball circles. Someone says Steph Curry is the greatest or Lebron is the greatest, then someone else counters PFFT IF THEY PLAYED IN JORDAN'S ERA and goes on about the league being “soft now.” Then someone else chimes in that Wilt Chamberlain's stats will never be equaled. Then someone counters by saying “Wilt was playing against plumbers and mailmen.” Et cetera.\n\nI'm with the plumbers and mailmen crowd. I don't care how many titles Margaret Court won in the 60s and 70s; the level of competition then was far far lower than it is today. If we could somehow put peak Margaret Court up against peak Serena Williams, I think Serena would blow her away. If you had Wilt Chamberlain go 1-on-1 with Joel Embiid or Nikola Jokic, Mr. 100 points would look like a YMCA rec league bum.\n\nWho has more “natural talent” is hard to address, and not a question I'm interested in here. My position is simply that by and large, modern athletes are better at their sport than athletes from significantly long ago. \n\n“Top 25 all time” lists always include a good helping of names from the distant past; I think this is mostly due to nostalgia and hero worship. A truly objective list, based on nothing but “how good are they at the game/sport,” would almost always be dominated by modern practitioners. Because mostly, they are just better.\n\nPeople say it's not fair to compare across eras; I think it's totally fair and people just don't like the result. I think when folks protest such comparisons, what they are really saying is, “please don't do that because I want to keep thinking this old timer that I have long admired is the best, and if you compare them to the modern elite, it will be an unfavorable comparison.”",

  "title": "CMV: humanity’s prioritisation of liberal economic interests instead of global social interests will ruin us",
  "selftext": "I believe we are torn on what the role of the West is. In the 20th century, there was a strife between the field of anthropology and the emergent field of human rights. The anthro side was culturally relativist, while the human rights side wanted to impose universal values to protect human dignity from a liberal perspective. Ultimately, the anthro side acquiesced to the human rights side, especially after WW2, acknowledging the need for liberal intervention at times of crisis. However, we still have our problems on this front.\n\nThe modern nature of Western intervention has tarnished the reputation of how far this kind of intervention should go. We forced democracies across the globe not for the goal of liberal social and democratic values, but to stop the spread of communist ones, ultimately because the neoliberal goal was an economically liberal one (such as FDI’s). It was forced because it was all part of a global power and economic goal, not a social humanitarian one. \n\nNowadays ideas of Western democratic intervention are met with heavy skepticism, but I believe this is because people are still not aware that a deliniation between liberal state intervention for the sake of humanitarian efforts and those for the sake of global economic order have yet to be made. The Western economies continue to pay African warlords for cobalt and lithium, the continue to pay Saudi Arabian nobility for oil who enslaved the majority of their population for oil. The West contributes to global instability and then acts suprised when many counties react by emigrating to the West in droves because they stand at the top of the global order. \n\nOn the public level, political and corporate interests in the West have become deeply entwined with technological advancements. Solidarity is difficult to come by, and when it is it’s mass disorganisation is co-opted and taken advantage of by the state (eg BLM was commodified by the democratic party in the US and the Arab Spring co-opted by the Egyptian military gov following the ousting of Mubarak). People hardly feel that they have an individual voice, so they set themselves against each other. Often you might find two liberals with similar goals at each other’s throats on an internet forum over some semantic nuanced disagreement (the people are lacking individual expression). \n\nTLDR: Liberalism is applied only economically, creating massive disjunctures and unrest. It could be applied socially if the people willed it under their Western democracies, but we are being driven farther and farther from actionable solidarity through our increasing alienation. \n\nAlso, I said ‘humanity,’ in the title but i’m specifically referring to the Western enforced global order so apologies if that comes across poorly.",

It keeps it entirely in check and shifts the power pole to the people. Isn’t this literally what Marx has thought of when he talks about the dictatorship of the proletarian but without it being ideological? You can’t cancel someone for the sake of canceling them, it has to be based on reasonable stance and allow for discourse, in which the accused party redeems themselves or digs their grave. You can argue for cases in which a people jump on a bandwagon abuse it but none of these have created valid existential threats that the everyday person doesn’t go though. Cancel culture strips these entities of a privilege but no of their position or existent, it gives em the right to earn it.\n\nI’m don’t want to say it’s better than voting but it gives the people immediate control over the political landscape and isn’t this sort of the ultimate goal of a democracy? For the people, by the people. \n\n\nMaybe I don’t see it, even if the potential brutality and monstrosity of the mob mentality exists, but acts of canceling doesn’t exceed the Internet space and its impact lies on the public persona of the entity and their representative not a person itself. As a political movement and an organic democratic tool, I don’t see how we can ever set aside cancel culture. It’s important and necessary!\n\n\n\nEdit: thank you guys so much for all the participation. I did not expect so many answers, it’s a bit overwhelming tbh. I’m trying to read them all and respond.

But even if this research is right, I think there is a clear and obvious explanation to it. Surely it's because people who have more sexual and relationship experience simply know a substandard lover when they get one, so of course they are more likely to cheat or break up and go look for someone better. The solution seems to be to just become a better lover.\n\nIn fact, I very much prefer to date people with a lot of experience! I've got two main reasons:\n\n1. People who have more sexual experience will statistically speaking be better lovers. This means that dating someone with a higher body count will mean you will get better sex.\n2.

Comoros\n\nAnd this is one of the biggest lies that I've ever been told. Because historically most of these countries are **conquered by Arabs** and they united the languages of all these countries and made the Arabic is the official language to all these countries.\n\n# And classifying these countries and classifying us (Egyptians) as Arabs is so as ridiculous as classifying Niger and Cameroon as European nations because they speak the same European language (French).\n\nAnd even countries like **Somalia**, Comoros, Mauritania and **Djibouti** most of its population **don't speak Arabic**. So I don't know why it's considered \"*an Arab State*\"\n\nGenetically and historically *Arabs are the descendants of Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula*, which are the countries 2 - 8 (Yemen & Gulf states). And what is more interesting about this fact even **genetically we are not Arabs.** \n\nThe **National Geographic Genographic Project (NGGP)** conducted a *genetic analysis* all across Egypt and they discovered that only 17 percent of Egyptians are Arabs, while **68 percent of the indigenous population** is from North Africa, four percent are from Jewish ancestry, three percent are of East African origins, another three percent from Asia Minor and three percent are South European.\r  \n\r\n\n[https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/](https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/) \n\n# And another article in the Gurdian said that Studies on modern Egyptian DNA support the view that neither Egyptian Muslims nor Copts are Arab. All the invasions that Egypt has experienced over millennia, including the Arab invasion, do not seem to account for more than 15% of modern Egyptians' ancestry. Which said that about 85% of Egyptians are descendants of the indigenous Ancient Egyptians.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/egyptian-arab-cultural-identity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/egyptian-arab-cultural-identity) \n\nAnd I think these studies are different due to the difference in samples of the population of Egypt.

  "title": "CMV: The quote \"Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it\" is ignorant and off the mark.",
  "selftext": "I've never been able to stand this quote, for a couple of reasons:  \nIt assumes that the reason history repeats itself is because of a lack of knowledge or wisdom about the past. That horrible crimes and unjust atrocities are perpetuated because of a lack of knowledge about history. I think this is wrong - I think human beings will always behave like this because it's in our nature to behave like this, and no amount of book-learning is going to change that.  \nAlso remember that so many of the evil tyrants, despots, and dictators of history were usually well educated and well read individuals who studied history deeply. Stalin and Hitler were famously well read. Learning about famous statesmen, politicians, generals, etc has been a commonly documented activity of the ruling elite going back to ancient times. The thing is, those individuals choose to learn a different lesson from history that you or I might learn. For instance, a normal person might read about the period of the Holocaust/WW2 and think, \"hmm, what can we do to prevent such horrifying atrocities in the future\". Someone with the disposition of a Stalin, or a Pol Pot, might read about that same period history and think \"what can I do to avoid Hitler's mistakes in my quest for power?\". No amount of book-reading is going to change their fundamental nature.  \nAnd yes, I understand that the vast majority of people are not bloodthirsty wannabe tyrants, but as long as the people who manipulate the levers of power and influence in the world are indifferent to the well-being of the common man (and they are, certainly), then humanity will always have pointless wars, populist dictators, petty tribalistic politics, etc. It is our nature to behave like this.  \nAt the end of the day, we are living beings that evolved on a world with finite resources, and thus evolution bred in us an inherent competitiveness, greed, lust, violence, myopia, us vs them mentality. This is deeper than human nature, it's the nature of most living things on Earth. History will continue to repeat itself until human nature changes, something which learning about the past will never be able to bring about.  \n2) There's a smug, silent assumption on the part of the person posting this quote somewhere that they have, in fact, learned from history, while the \"other\" has not. But history is actually insanely complicated, and its variables and parameters are always changing, so a behavior or course of action that worked in 50 BC likely won't work in the 21st Century. We almost always look back at history and think that the \"right\" behavior was so simple, that it's shocking that people behaved otherwise, but this is just hindsight bias. We have to live history going forward, and that is hard, and the best decision to make is often very difficult to determine.  \nAgain, most of the statesmen and politicians of the past who have made horrible, boneheaded decisions were often well educated and well-read individuals (take, for instance, the politicians of Britain and France in the 1930's, during the period before WW2) who thought deeply about history, and yet they still made those mistakes. We like to think that, because we bought a history book off Amazon or from Barnes and Nobles, and spent the next few weeks reading it, that we are suddenly enlightened about history, but the reality is so much more complicated than that. Anyhow, rant over.  \nTLDR: The mistakes of history are repeated, and always will be repeated, because of human nature, which is fixed, and this is something that will not be changed by learning/reading about history. Humans will always behave horribly to one another and will always make myopic, unintelligent decisions regarding the future because that is how we fundamentally are all the way down to our core.",

Outdoor adventures, Playful antics at home, etc. They're up for anything, bringing this infectious energy that makes life way more fun.  \n\n\n  \nSure, cats have their own thing going on, and I'm not knocking their charm.

  "title": "CMV: Despite Black History Month, Widespread Ignorance and Uneducated Perspectives Fuel Misguided Beliefs.",
  "selftext": "To follow rules A and C, I am first going to clearly outline what my belief is and what I am willing to have my mind changed on. I will divide this post into 3 categories. **preliminary data**, **my belief**, and **education**.\n\n*Disclaimer*: this will be a long post, so please come with an open mind and read all sections before going to the comments section. Even though I will respond, it will be slightly annoying if someone says something that I already covered in my post.\n\n**Preliminary Data**  \nFirstly, there is a massive difference between having an opinion on an issue and being objectively wrong. Many conservatives use black people and the black communities in their political speeches, not knowing that they are objectively wrong.  Good examples of this are the claims that systemic racism does not exist, and people who talk about it are crying victim. They throw it alongside \"white guilt\" and \"white oppression\". Another thing that conservatives (and Asian Americans) try to do, is compare the successfulness of each community to create the false argument that the reason why asians are more successful is because they \"work harder\", \"value education\" etc.\n\n**My Belief**  \nThe reason why I believe that people often give hurtful, objectively wrong takes on the black community, is because they are uneducated on black history. Most of the arguments people use against systemic racism (for example), could easily be disproven by bringing out a history book and understanding the events of the past.\n\nI believe that black history month is a necessity. I believe that even though we celebrate black history month every year, clearly it's not effective because people do not understand the basic principles of black history. I believe that if we were to educate more people about black history, these uneducated racist beliefs would be removed. As of right now, I have a lot of faith and believe that this is a great solution. I believe that most people use black history month as a celebration, while ignoring what it stands for. Widespread Ignorance and Uneducated Perspectives Fuel Misguided Beliefs.\n\n**Education**  \nThis final section of my post is going to give arguments against the commonly held beliefs noted in the ('Preliminary Data') sections.\n\n# For those that deny systemic racism\n\nIt is well documented in history the specific policies that were put into place to confine black individuals into poor neighborhoods, with poor education, unable to buy homes, etc. Redlining and 'Separate but equal' are the first things that come into mind. If you are going to deny this fact, I will tolerate you, however keep in mind that you are proving my original title to be correct.\n\nAnyways, the other argument that people make is to say that these policies are illegal now. Even though the policies are illegal, the impact it had was not only severe, but still prevalent. To understand why, we have the monopoly analogy.\n\nLet's say that you and your friends were playing monopoly for the past 3 hours. If someone else joins you after that time, would it be fair? Sure, the rules are exactly the same. But you would inherently be at a massive advantage because you were able to play the game for 3 hours before I was allowed to.\n\nKeep in mind, this analogy also explains equity pretty well. If I was given some sort of perk to help me catch up, I am not being 'against you'. I am not 'discriminating' against you. It was an attempt to make it more fair for everyone on the board.\n\n# For those that believe in the African American / Asian American success comparison and \"model minority\".\n\nConservatives and Asian Americans try to compare the successfulness of asian American communities to black communities, to create the false narrative that the reason why they are more successful is because they \"work harder\", \"value education\", etc.\n\nThis sounds good at first, until you realize there are 3 massive advantages they have by default.\n\n1. Generally speaking, the way the us immigration policy works, is that it favors individuals with higher education and higher income, meaning they are more likely to already be at an advantage when they come here. This article explains it very well: [https://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2016/04/11/why-asian-americans-are-the-most-educated-group-in-america/](https://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2016/04/11/why-asian-americans-are-the-most-educated-group-in-america/)\n2. The government also provides grants, business loans, and opportunities for said immigrants. Traditionally, African Americans have been denied these opportunities\n3. immigrants in general did not have to face the same systemic issues that certain native-born groups did.\n\nThis entire 'model minority' thing is just a cheap way to discredit the struggles of the African American community.\n\n# African American Schooling\n\nI will keep this section short because I have been typing for long enough.\n\n[https://www.floridabrightfutures.gov/](https://www.floridabrightfutures.gov/)\n\nSomeone tried to argue that this policy gives free education for everyone native born in Florida. The requirements:\n\n3.5 weighted GPA or betterat least 1290 on the SATand 100 hours of logged community service\n\nFirst on the SAT: [https://www.jbhe.com/features/53\\_SAT.html](https://www.jbhe.com/features/53_SAT.html)\n\nClearly, one of the main factors in explaining the SAT racial gap is that black students almost across the board are not being adequately schooled to perform well on the SAT and similar tests. Public schools in many neighborhoods with large black populations are underfunded, inadequately staffed, and ill equipped to provide the same quality of secondary education that is offered in predominantly white suburban school districts.\n\nA major reason for the SAT racial gap appears to be explained by the fact that black students who take the SAT have not followed the same academic track as white students. It is true that 97 percent of both blacks and whites who take the SAT have studied algebra in high school. But in higher level mathematics courses such as trigonometry and calculus, whites hold a very large lead. In 2006, 47 percent of white SAT test takers had taken trigonometry in high school compared to 36 percent of black test takers. Some 30 percent of white test takers had taken calculus in high school. Only 15 percent of black students had taken calculus, one half as many as whites. Thirty-three percent of white SAT test takers had taken\n\nThere is a lot more, but you get the point\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAnyways. Now that you have everything laid out, the preliminary, my belief, and the education. CMV!",

  "selftext": "Firstly, I believe that because humans’ theoretical evolution mostly happened at random, it could have easily been any other singly branch on the evolution tree that became as complex as us. Therefore just because we are given higher awareness/intelligence doesn’t mean we inherently hold higher value over any other kinds of sentient life.\n\nThen, we have the overwhelming arguments that humans have higher capacities for evil than most sentient life. We can conceptualize future events, not just us doing them, but what other people/things might do, which allows us an advantage to scheme, perform multilateral manipulation of others, and with enough mindfulness, limit the vulnerableness and unawareness that gets most other less intelligent species killed or extinct. We typically have direct responsibility for our acts of insidious nature because we are self-aware enough to know what role our actions take in others’ lives, using empathy. On the animals side, we may not fully know if other animals possess this empathy or not when doing things like capturing/stalking prey, but we know for the most part that most don’t communicate with a language that tells others they know what they’re doing, which is where the harm of conscious insidious behavior spreads.\n\nTherefore, due to the exponentially higher amount of self-aware evil that humans knowingly commit, I believe it would be moral for humans to take a step back on the Darwin ladder and become extinct to stop the torture that has been inflicted on other animals in the name of “we got to be the first species to be much smarter than you”. I believe this sentiment is biased against non-humans, who like I said, I don’t believe has lesser inherent value than humans. If we were to go extinct, that doesn’t end all future intelligent life, and my hope is that the digital and ecological footprint left by humans would be a warning call for the next species that evolves to be self-aware, and if there is no next species, there’s still no moral right or wrong coming from this that I can think of. Can anyone change my view?\n\nEDIT: I’m sorry for being so stuck on my position to others, it helps to fully challenge everything my brain tells me to challenge. But overall I’m convinced that it’s too vague to speculate that this would be a positive for all sentient life. Thanks to all for the intriguing and thought-provoking points!!!",

  "selftext": "I've been a big predictor of AI and Robotics replacing jobs for the last 10 years. I always said by 2030, cars and semi trucks would drive themselves, all stores would be self checkout, cleaning robots will replace janitors, construction would be done with huge 3d printers, and basically any kind of work would just require faaaaar less people. \n\nSocialism in the form of Universal Basic Income (supplied by heavy taxes on corporations that use machines to replace workers) is the only decent path forward. What else are we going to? Let people starve in the streets? Create fake jobs to pay people?\n\nI think unemployment could rise to be as high as 25% between 2030 and 2040. The AI/robotics take over is just waiting on one thing: the prices of robotics to go down so that replacing fast food workers with a conveyor belt (similar to a car factory) is more profitable than the current human model (for the record, I don't expect fully automated places until 2040+ but if labor is reduced across the board by even 25%, we are going to be in trouble).\n\nEurope will pivot fine because they are closer to socialism than we are. \n\nIn the U. S. though, boomers and conservatives are going to resist UBI with their very lives. Most boomers are retired anyways and will heavily resent the idea of people being able to \"retire\" at 18 while they had to work their asses for 40+ years to \"earn the right to quit working\". \n\nWe will require the boomer vote over the next 10 years in order for democrats to get 60% of the Senate to agree to a UBI bill, which is a fat chance. \n\nOur social safety systems will collapse because boomers will never vote to increase funding for \"handouts\". \n\nMany of us will lose our houses and everything we own. \n\nExcept for our guns \n\nWe won't just starve to death on the streets. Many of us will start robbing places for food or even shelter. \n\nI could imagine some having so much resentment that they open fire with an assault rifle on a crowd of who as they perceive as being rich people. \n\nI myself, if I have nothing left to lose and I think I'm going to starve on the streets, I may be more inclined to take out people who I believe are responsible for voting my life away. Or at least to secure resources for myself and my family. \n\nThere will be HUGE clashes of tens of thousands of armed (but not trained) people agaist police, swat, national guard, and probably even the military. Until boomers and conservatives finally give in and vote for politicians that will switch our society to socialism, millions will die in the violence that ensues because our dysfunctional government allows for the tyranny of the minority. \n\nThe only way to avoid any of this is to start building in UBI systems now before our puny social safety nets start collapsing from the incoming high unemployment levels. And whenever I suggest this now to my boomer parents (who actually haven't voted republican since Bush), they scoff at it. If conservative democrats aren't even for it, we got no chance. \n\nYou won't be able to CMV by arguing that automation won't send unemployment skyrocketing by 2030. You'll need to argue based on how you think our government will react. Maybe the president can declare martial law and use the military to get food, water, and shelter to the tens of millions that will be displaced. \n\nLooking at the political landscape now, I have 0 hope anything will get done until after millions have started dying. \n\nWith that said, I do think we will come out of this as a stronger society. A society where you don't have to work for basic needs is one humans have never experienced before and I think it could be transcendent for our species. We will get to focus on living our lives and doing the things we want, not what we have to do. \n\nGetting there will be bloody though. Please CMV, I hate this belief but cannot find any evidence to the contrary.\n\nEdit: I am fully committed to the premise of my arguments. Nobody has been able to convince me that \"automation isn't going to replace jobs at crisis levels\".\n\nLet's assume the premise is true but take out the time lines since you all are screaming \"too soon!\" at me. How will governments adapt when demand for human labor gets so low that there is permanent high unemployment? That's what I really wanted to discuss.\n\nWhat's the solution? How can it be anything other than UBI? \n\n",

This is not me saying that discrimination is good - it's me saying that, as a black person, why would you ever want to patronize a business that is *legally obligated* to serve you, and that in any other circumstance would treat you worse than a white patron. This is just an example, of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a perfect world, there would be no racism and there would be no discrimination based on these protected classes, but we don't live in a perfect world, and it's important to realize that we can't legislate ourselves out of it.

Many modern nations were literally created (instigated) by colonizers, who came in and brought massive changes. States sprang up to organize and defend themselves from 'alien invaders' such as the British Empire. If UFOs/UAPs are proven to be real, our individual country and culture based differences would become obsolete.\n\nIt would give us the reason to bridge cultures separated by thousands of miles to work collectively to help represent each other to an advanced culture that may have difficulty understanding humanity. It would hep us eradicate our fears of each other, embrace our similarities and be less critical of our differences. \n\nOur religious differences which seem so important today would pale in the face of a visitor from the stars whose technology and knowledge of the universe is potentially thousands or even millions of years more informed than our own.\n\nEdit: Aliens are friendly.

  "selftext": "I know this post will be controversial but I've been thinking about it for some time. There seems to be a disconnect over how politicians and law and regulation is overall started in the United states. Many people will give a pass to a person who voted for a politican who enacts a bad policy for their state country or city. It all starts origin wise with a vote by the people for a person or proposition to enact a law. \n\nFor example the people in states like Texas and Idaho and other states with complete abortion bans (even the life of the mother is really just on paper) if you are a conservative person who has been voting republican your whole life and saw the extremist pro forced birth laws creep in your state year after year you can't be surprised by your state now post dobbs going full abortion ban. Many will say it's counter productive to do this as it could drive people away from changing their beliefs and voting for another person party or policy. But I believe that confronting someone with that fact that these polices that are enacted are in fact started by a vote. Many people feel that their votes are not causes for bad policy and can divorce their responsibility for their vote for harmful policy. Many \"left wing\" Podcasters claimed this about blaming Trump voters in 2016 by saying you couldn't blame them for voting for him. \n\nAnd so people don't think I'm leaning politically one way or another I think that way about a voter in the south side of Chicago who bemoans gang violence but won't vote for another alderman or state representative or voters who are upset about rising crime yet vote for people who support cashless bail or abolishing bail altogether.",

  "selftext": "As a parent, I'm concerned about my 13yo son's social engagements, which is mostly online, through gaming. He has friends from school, but rarely sees them after school or on the weekends outside of school. I worry about the long-term effects on his social and emotional development as a person spending so much time online.\n\nI'm in my late 40s, and grew up in a time before smartphones and online communities. In my experience in-person interactions benefited me greatly: getting a deeper understanding of friends through nonverbal cues, a sense of true connection with friends when you're just hanging out, and the opportunity for more meaningful conversations when there are fewer distractions around.\n\nThese things seem to be missing in my son's online interactions, which are often limited to in-game discussions about strategy, or even which game to play next, and then lack any in-depth (or even mundane talk) that happens naturally when you spend time together face-to-face. Also, he ends up meeting a variety of online-only friends and those relationships are more fleeting and never get that deep and real. I think spending more time with fewer, but real in person friends would be better for his social development. He'd have more opportunities to learn social skills - listening, empathy, resolving conflicts, social cues, etc.\n\nI advocate for a much more balanced approach, ideally splitting his social time equally between online and offline. We already don't allow him to play games during the weekdays when school is on. And I'd do more to encourage and allow him and his friends to get together in person more.",

  "selftext": "My proposal is simple. When a child in born in the US or becomes a US citizen, they receive a 1 time payment of 10k that goes into a 401(k) like account gaining compound interest. It would be tied to something like the S&P500 to try and maximize growth rate. It would be gaining interest for something like 70 years. The person wouldn't be able to access the account in the meantime. But when you retire, you would have something like $800k. It would cost the taxpayer ~50 billion a year compared to the current SSA budget of 1,500 billion a year. I know it wouldn't start being used until ~2090, but the actual SS payment would start decreasing around 2050. I've been thinking about this for a while, and I would just like to know why it wouldn't work.\n\n\nI would like to make some clarifications. First, this would basically be a government subsidized 401(k) account that would couldn't access until you reached 70, like current SS. It would basically be a diversified investment, like an index fund, that you can't have access to for 70 years. The only difference would be that the money you got would be your own personal account, not a pool of money. Second, between 1970 and 2020, the average S&P500 return on investment rate was ~10%, while inflation was ~3-4%. Third, even if this entire program was an absolute dumpster fire and failed completely. It would only cost $2-3 billion a month, while the DOD spent ~$60 billion and SS ~125 billion. Fourth, in order for this program to work, current SS payments would have to continue. This means that future workers who wouldn't get SS would still have to work/pay into SS to support the current system. However, as the number of people getting SS would decrease and the number of people just getting this 401(k) investment would increase, the overall SS taxes would go down. Along with that, the people that have 401(k) investments would have more money when they retire than current SS recipients.",

  "selftext": "James Baldwin nailed it best a generation ago. \n\nBut on a deeper level the fact of the matter is, the well is poisoned between peoples with white skin in America and peoples with black skin. No matter how many times you reference partnership during the Civil Rights Movement, the overall political climate in America is not one where a white person can say to someone black “hey you owe us x because of Y” black people are instantly going bristle at the perceived entitlement of the white person speaking.\n\nThis isn’t to say there aren’t Jews of color, Jewish-Black partnerships toward equity and racial justice or even that future collaborations are impossible. I don’t think divides are unbridgeable but they are very real and need to be acknowledged. Speaking of divides, I think progressive leftists and activists in the US need to acknowledge that Jewish patience is wearing thin. And while I’m not trying to speak for all Jews, from what I’ve seen, across the political spectrum, I think a lot of Jewish allies are increasingly disillusioned with the discourse coming from the Left and the perceived double standard applied to them. Take the most recent example where even mildly pro Jewish stances like that of Noah Schnapp, of Stranger Things fame, are rewarded with virulent antisemitism and patronizing “sit down and shut up white boy” talk from black and white activists on twitter and subs like r/fauxmoi. \n\nThe divide is only going to grow and get worse over time the more they refuse to acknowledge it and the more they refuse to acknowledge that antisemitism is growing amongst young blacks and Latinos.

  "title": "CMV: AI art isn't theft, and effort shouldn't be a prerequisite for making art",
  "selftext": "I'm interested in what people have to say about a couple of things. I definitely agree that there need to be regulations in place--AI shouldn't be able to claim it's another author, for example, but to raise a couple of counterpoints to what the anti-AI crowd thinks, I have a couple of questions. I have my own answers, but I'd like to see what other people think:\n\n1. How do we differentiate between a human studying other people's works and then using them to develop their own style and AI? and\n2. Should effort be a requirement for art? Is someone who's disabled less worthy of creating art than someone who's abled?\n\nHere are some of my thoughts:\n\n1. I think it's a bit of a turing test. If you can't tell the difference between an AI using other people's works as inspiration vs. a human, then it opens a whole can of worms to just say \"well AI doesn't have rights, because it's AI.\" You also open things up to witchhunts where you're persecuting people because you think they might be using AI.\n2. I think we have to judge things based on results to a certain extent. If you generate a wholly-AI generated work, at least at this point, it's bound not to be as good as the work of someone who put actual effort in. But what if an author spends a lot of time with the AI, going back and forth with it about plot ideas, characters, etc.? What if the author guides the style of the AI based on the style of their own work? I think it has to be said that while society under capitalism assumes that effort is traded for money, that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. There are many devices that make our lives easier--wheelchairs, glasses, the printing press, technology that allows you to trace artwork, etc. Should these things be banned because they make labour easier?In the end, I think your ideas are your ideas, and using AI to help you improve upon those ideas is still going to result in different work than someone else. I think using AI is a very personal choice--akin to say, the choice between hand-drawn art and digital art. Do you ban digital art because it's \"easier\" than hand-drawn art? Or do you let people choose whether to engage with digital art? I think more choices are rarely a bad thing.\n\nAll that being said, I'd like to think I'm a reasonable person, and am genuinely interested to see what people have to say on the topic.\n\n**Edit: Important Notes- I should clarify that what I'm referring to here is not AI-generated images, but writing. (I'm a writer, and as such I'm not really qualified to speak intelligently about visual media.)**\n\n**I also am not qualified (or really interested) in the debate about wholly AI-generated writing. I happen to think that's not very interesting. What I'm interested (and semi-qualified to have an opinion) in is writing that I would call AI-human-hybrid writing, where you put in a substantial amount of effort into idea generation, formation, and editing.**\n\n\\*\\*\\***Edit 3: Because I'm not allowed to make a top comment on my own post (didn't know this, sorry), I'm posting an example of how I use the generative model sudowrite to illustrate the kind of thing I'm talking about. Sorry for any confusion I caused by linking to my own comment:**  \nI'd argue that good AI can interpret things. For example, sudowrite, the language learning model I've been using, had this to say about the 2000-word sample of my scifi novel that I put in:  \n\"3rd person POV, introspective/melancholic tone, complex vocabulary, vivid descriptions, realistic dialogue. Steady rhythm. Character development, world-building. Themes: empathy, isolation, and connection. Motifs of Karros, cybernetic brains, and reality. Explores social/political implications of genetic engineering/technological advancement on Zenobia.\"  \nI put in information sudowrite calls a \"story bible,\" including a braindump, genre, style, a synopsis, characters, and an outline. It generated a first chapter. I'd argue it copied my style pretty well without being derivative.  \nCompare a paragraph of what it generated to my own writing. Here's what it generated with my guidance:  \n\"The cobalt skies of Helena wept ash, a solemn gray veil that draped over the city’s streets like a mourner's shroud. The air was thick with the scent of artificial smoke, wafting from the meticulously crafted pyres that blazed in controlled fury. The sorrowful tableau of the reenactment evoked a haunting beauty—a solemn homage to Earth's distant past and its architectural marvels lost to time. Onlookers stood shoulder to shoulder along the replicated Seine, their faces glowing in the firelight, captivated by the spectacle of synthetic embers licking at the sky.\"  \nAnd here's some of my own writing:  \n\"It had taken nearly a year to figure out how to safely reenact the fire of Notre Dame. A transparent semi-permeable nanobot shield kept the fire contained but oxygenated. The fire itself ignited the sky, horrifying yet grotesquely beautiful at the same time.On the streets of the city of Helena, humanity cried.\\[...\\]The decision to burn the cathedral had been hotly contested—the exact replica of Notre Dame had become a staple in the city, venerated by its highly Catholic population just as much as Earth’s Parisians revered the original. The flame differed from the original fire only in the fact that the bells now rang loudly from the towers of the cathedral, their cries ringing out in pained peals. It was as if the bells themselves mourned the loss of their master, mourned the loss of the ever-towering spires of Notre Dame.\"  \nThe two writing styles are definitely different, but I can learn from what the AI wrote to improve my own writing. Similarly, I can teach the AI some things I think it did wrong. In fact, it can teach itself some things it did wrong. If I run that first paragraph through the feedback feature, it comes up with a lot of points about the writing that it thinks could be improved.  \nExamples sudowrite gives on avenues for improvement:  \n1) The city of Helena is described as a place of sorrow and grief, yet the main character, Card, seems almost detached from this emotion. Is there a reason for this? Is he numb to the tragedy around him, or is he suppressing his feelings in some way? This could be explored more to give the reader a better understanding of his character and his relationship to the city.  \n2) The use of technology in this society is a central theme, but it is only briefly touched upon. What are the implications of this advanced technology on the characters and the world they live in? How does it affect their relationships and their understanding of what is real? This could be delved into further to add depth to the story.  \n3) There is a mention of Card being an \"alien-human hybrid,\" but it is not fully explained or explored. This aspect of his identity could be woven into the story more to enhance the reader's understanding of his character and his place in this society.\"  \nWhich are all very good points that I can then brainstorm with sudowrite to elaborate upon.  \nHere's the thing: I wouldn't mind if sudowrite used the data I gave it to help other people. Hell, I wouldn't even mind if people generated fanfiction using my writing, as long as they gave me credit for the original work. I don't think the AI is plagiarizing my idea just because I fed it some generative info. It came up with an entirely different way to portray the scene. In my work, the cathedral is actually being burned down. In the AI's work, it's all an elaborate illusion.That's incredibly interesting and valuable to me, and I think it helps make me a better writer.  \nIn my example, did I steal from other writers? Was I lazy, or did I instead use the AI as an opportunity to learn how to improve my own work?",

I'm no expert but from my reading on soap, when in contact with dirt and germs, the soap molecules thoroughly surround the dirt/germs and form tiny clusters which prevent them from attaching to anything else. These then just rinse off down the drain. Any grime that remains on a bar of soap after contact with your body, or any other surface, is encapsulated in this soap molecule clusters, and will immediately rinse off after contact with water. In the shower you are constantly being rinsed with water, so there should be no concern about how clean your bar of soap is.\n\nImportant note... I could see washcloths or loofahs being a different consideration here, when talking about the order of washing yourself. If you're applying the soap to your dirty body directly using a cloth, then maybe it could collect grime that you wouldn't want to rub on your face. I don't use a washcloth/loofah so this post is entirely focused on the bar of soap itself.",

Peterson appealed, and has lost that appeal. \n\nYou can read the initial court conclusions [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23924637-peterson-v-college-of-psychologists-of-ontario-_-superior-court-of-justice),  as the appeals court gave no reasoning.\n\nThere are a lot of people who are viewing this as a violation of his rights to free speech and see it as a specific attack on his views.  Again, ignoring the legitimacy of his views, I think the court decision is absolutely correct, and his \"punishment\" is beyond fair.  \n\nFirst off, while Peterson is allowed to hold any view he likes, if he wishes to maintain association with the Ontario College of Psychologists, which is what a license indicates.  If he does not wish to maintain himself to the standards of the OCP, he can become a councellor without a license and practice by his own set of standards.  If he wants to maintain his license, and use it to lend himself credibility, he must live up to the standards set out by the OCP.  \n\nBeyond that, he isn't even being punished for his views, but the manner in which he carries out his message.  The actual code of ethics violation is the very first rule of the Ethical Standards, section 2, as follows:\n\n>Not engage publicly (e.g., in public statements, presentations, research reports, with primary clients or other contacts) in degrading comments about others, including demeaning jokes based on such characteristics as culture, nationality, ethnicity, colour, race, religion, sex, gender, or sexual orientation.\n\nand as the court ruling points out, he has engaged in degredation of specific people on numerous accounts.\n\nThese includes jokes around suicide, referring to a city councellor as a “appalling self-righteous moralizing thing”, calling Eliot Page's physicaian a criminal, etc etc.  \n\nWhether or not the underlying opinions Peterson has are valid opinions to hold, these sorts of statements are obviously violations to the code of conduct written above.\n\nThe OCP is well within their rights to maintain these standards, and ask anyone practice to hold to them.  \n\nFurther, there is a higher level of standard expected of Peterson if he wishes to use his accrediation to give himself credibility.  The court notes that Peterson changed the way in which he used his label, stating in 2020 that he \"opted not to advertise his title on his Twitter\".  By identifying himself as a \"clinical psychologist\", which did in 2022 on twitter, he is using his association to the OCP formally, and in doing so, their credibility as an organization is *also* being invoked. \n\nThe courts determined that the OCP has every right to set their own standards and adhere to them.  While asking him to refrain his language could be an infringement on free expression if he were being arrested or fined by the government, this is an example of an organization creating their standards, and resting their association on those standards.  There is no obligation for any organization to maintain associiation and approval, even in a society with free expression.",

An older guy in his 50s kept groping me on the bus on my way back from school. After that there has been several instances of guys touching me in an indecent way throughout the years. This is not even counting the catcalling and being stared at that I have faced, just the physical molestations. I guess I am lucky in that I have not been sexually assaulted yet or had a bottle of acid thrown at my face, but that's about it. \n\nHowever I recently saw a post talking about women's issues where a guy asked in the comments \"what is your source which states that all women have actually been harassed at least once in their lives?\" And technically he is correct, because there has actually never been any study proving the statement that \"ALL adult women have been harassed in some way or form throughout their lives\".\n\nIt made me really curious about it, because after all it is very possible that I have likely been projecting my personal experiences on others.

The government spends tens of billions of dollars a year just to make the labor force smaller. Obviously only a fraction of this is black people being imprisoned due to racism, but it is one of the most concrete effects of systemic racism.\n* Employment discrimination. Yes, it helps white people get slightly nicer jobs, but, again, there is currently a labor shortage and those costs are just passed to the (majority white) consumers.\n* More broadly, the most historically racist parts of the US, the parts which had slavery and the Jim Crow south, are now the poorest parts of the country.

I’d always been curious about Key West, since I know a lot of people who’ve been and I’ve never really been sure what to expect about it, though I’m a big fan of key lime pie. I recently had the opportunity to spend two nights in Key West, and found out what it was all about. I have to admit I’m fairly disappointed after the visit and feel like it’s kind of a place with the worst of New Orleans and the Caribbean, and not much redeeming.\n\nIt’s the worst of New Orleans in that Duval Street is a pretty clear lesser knockoff of Bourbon Street. Bourbon Street has a shitload of bars, clubs, etc., and is a gateway to the rest of the French Quarter. The street also has an energy and character about it, bodily fluids running down it and all. Duval Street has a handful of bars, a lot of tourist traps/shops, and there isn’t much around it except for residential neighborhoods. The food also wasn’t anything close to on par with New Orleans or other cuisine tourist spots.\n\nIt’s the worst of the Caribbean in that it’s not really in the Caribbean, but it’s so far south that it prides itself on being tropical and the image it conjures is margaritas in the sand. In reality, almost no hotels/resorts are actually beachfront, and there aren’t many major beaches that you see driving around. Most hotels aren’t that distinguishable from any other hotel in a tourist destination, when a Caribbean resort is almost guaranteed to be on the beach, with a sprawling property with pools, restaurants, etc. I’m also a diver, and did a few dives while there. Key West sells itself as a diving destination up there with the premiere Caribbean diving spots (the Caymans, Bonaire, Cozumel, etc.), but that’s not the experience I had diving. The water was certainly colder than the Caribbean at the same time of year, the visibility was a lot worse, the currents were stronger than your typical Caribbean dive site, and I didn’t come out of the water impressed much by what I’d seen.\n\nHelp me find some positives about Key West, a way it’s not just a shitty Wish.com version of New Orleans crossed with the Caribbean, and something to go back for? Right now, the only way I could see it being a place worth visiting is if you’re a drunk college kid, LGBTQ+, or a middle-aged swinger.",

  "title": "CMV: It's not okay to ask for advice about a potential love interest from another friend.",
  "selftext": "Yesterday during my session with my therapist, she said it's okay to ask a woman's friend's about them if I'm interested in them. For example, if I ask if the person is single, they may say \"Yes, she is single, she might be interested\" or \"No, she has a boyfriend, sorry\", for example.\n\nHowever, I've been hesitant to do that and I like to treat crushes as a one-man, \"no one but yourself, trust no one\" job. This is for a few main reasons:\n\n1. I feel that it would be putting my energy into the wrong thing. People say that you should talk to the woman DIRECTLY when pursuing a relationship. This means gauging her potential interest through social cues, stating your intentions/asking her on a date, etc. I think telling other people you like a woman carries the risk of them passing the knowledge to your love interest *before* you can state your feelings directly, which can show a lack of confidence. It would block direct communication of your feelings and thereby reduce the chances of a *clearly communicated* romantic relationship. Why spend time and energy trying to learn about a woman and communicate your interests *through* another person when you could use the same time and energy to ask her out, get to know her better, and gauge her interest via social cues? Why do all sorts of crowdsourcing and gathering enough information to write a research paper over... a simple crush? Something that plenty of people have and can handle with ease?\n\n2. The woman's mutual friends aren't obligated to give me info about her. In fact, they may even give me the wrong info if they aren't comfortable giving me true information, which could screw me over in the long run. All of that could be avoided by cutting all the extra people out of the equation and talking to the woman directly.\n\n3. I feel that it entirely misses the point of dating. If you want to establish a relationship, people say, state your intentions and ask her out. The question is not: \"Is she single?\" \"Does she have a boyfriend?\" The question is: \"How can I communicate my intentions and seeing if this person likes me back?\" Do I want to find out if a woman is *single*, or if I have relationship potential with said woman?\n\nMy hesitation comes from poor experiences in grade school. Two that come to mind are:\n\n1. Senior year of HS. I liked a girl from band. Her friend posted on his Snapchat story responding to an anonymous comment. The comment asked \"Is [crush] single?\" to which he responded \"Yeah, go hit her up\". I commented on the post asking how I can do that. He didn't directly answer the question, and instead asked \"Did you ask that?\" The conversation didn't continue after that. A few weeks later, I heard the girl was dating the male friend in question. On his story, he responded to an anonymous comment asking \"Are you and [crush] dating?\" by confirming the statement.\n\n2. Also senior year of HS. I tried pursuing a relationship with a girl from my class, and I admit I was not in the right in this situation because I didn't take signals of her not being interested, mistook friendliness for romantic attraction, and became distressed over not getting what I wanted. I asked several of my classmates if she was single, to which I got several different answers. Most of them just didn't know, some of them said she was single but not looking for a romantic partner, some of them said she had a boyfriend, and even one of them said she was flirting with a guy but I could somehow \"overtake\" him if I tried hard enough. One day I asked the girl \"are you dating someone\", to which she said no but it was an uncomfortable no. I admit this was a big mistake on my part. I strongly believe some of them told her I liked her. One day I messaged her asking about going to the beach during spring break with some of our peers, to which she said she would not be able to since she would be traveling out of the country. One day I was with some of her friends during the lunch break. They told me they knew I had a crush on her, so they tried videocalling her on my phone (it didn't go through), then asked what I would do if she had COVID (this was in 2020 right before quarantine), then dared me to sing a song about her. One of them also told me she would actually not be traveling out of the country and therefore could bring her on the beach trip. A few days later, the girl blocked me on my socials and the beach trip didn't happen due to quarantine. I was shocked because I felt that \"I did everything I was supposed to do, and I still got blocked.\"\n\nMy trust in other people went down after that and since then I became scared of asking for advice about a specific person from my peers out of fear of being given the wrong information and fucked over as a result. \n\nHowever, I have begun making some effort to rebuild my trust with my peers in that sense. It was only recently in early 2023 that I opened up to a select few of my closest friends about a platonic obsession (squish) with a female friend, and after opening up to them I felt a million times better. Now I would like to further open myself up and feel more comfortable about telling my peers about romance.\n\nCMV",

A child who is succeeding in a New Mexico driven education environment, would see major damage if their parents were to get a job in Maine.    \nThis is also possible with the disparity in quality of education, but without a standard, I see it being exacerbated.  In my example, without the Dept of Education, New Mexico may prioritize a trades/agricultural type of curriculum that their students would thrive in, while Maine may focus on a STEM style of curriculum, which the New Mexico student may not be able to catch up to.  The opposite is true, where a child of Maine may not be able to catch up to an agriculturally driven curriculum.  \n\nI also believe that states will have a much easier time of fudging their own stats to claim success while the constituency is left in the dark surrounding the pitfalls.  With a national standard, there are at least things we can point to across the spectrum of states that can be used to bolter ideas or initiatives.  Most importantly, we can establish different case laws around educational laws to ensure the historically disenfranchised are looked after.    \nI don't see a huge benefit to dismantling the Dept of Ed aside from making it easier for state governments to trap, water down, or pigeon-hole, their students.    \nThis is not to say i'm please with the current federal regulations (No Child Left Behind), but I believe that education should remain a national standard.  \n\nI will try to respond as much as I can, but please be patient with my first CMV post.

  "selftext": "Hello dear community,\n\n~~I would like to start my argumentation with a quote often attributed to Voltaire:~~\n\n~~\"To learn who rules over you, find out who you are not allowed to criticize.\"~~\n\n~~This quote is often taken to convey the idea that those who suppress discussions and criticism are often the ones wielding oppressive power in society. When examining societal discourse, people often focus on criticizing the opposing political side, which is quite normal in a democracy.~~\n\nThe issue, in my view, lies in the authority that sets the foundation for these discussions. While there are official sources directly from parliaments that accurately and neutrally document what has transpired, few individuals have the time to read through all of it. Instead, we rely on news media to filter out the (supposedly?) important information and present it to the reader. This wouldn't be a problem if the subsequently published news were not being reinterpreted by the author.\n\nThe problem with online news media is that they are primarily financed through advertising rather than subscriptions and impulse purchases. A single click is the most valuable, and obtaining it is crucial. The risk of publishing a bad piece of news, not getting clicks, and consequently not earning advertising revenue is much greater than with print media, which employs a subscription model and still receives money upfront even if an editorial is not widely read. They would still receive the money if the magazine were bought at the kiosk because no one really reads the entire magazine before buying it.\n\nTo maximize clicks on an article, news media must employ tactics to lure the online reader, who has a wide array of choices, to their own site. This is where the tricks come into play: emotional and sensational headlines get clicked more often than sober and neutral ones. However, not every event in our society is emotional and sensational. In fact, very few are. To present neutral news as sensational and emotional as possible without altering the truth, internet media resorts to some tricks:\n\nFor example, in a city X, a person has died. Due to the stab wounds, it is suspected that the person was murdered with a knife, and the police are investigating for murder and have arrested some individuals, including a foreigner.\n\nThe neutral headline would read:\n\n\"Police Investigate Suspected Murder in City X\"\n\nSo far, so neutral. However, that's not brutal enough for the journalist, so let's add some brutality:\n\n\"Police Investigate Bloodbath in City X\"\n\nDo you see how the \"suspected\" can be dropped? Because the crime scene was full of blood, regardless of whether it was murder or not. If an foreigner is among the arrested individuals, let's add that:\n\n\"Police Investigate Foreigner for Bloodbath in City X\"\n\nEverything is still true. An investigation is ongoing against a foreigner, and there was a bloodbath. However, for the reader, it may appear as if the foreigner is the only arrest in the investigation. The reader is led to think that the foreigner caused the bloodbath because he is (apparently) the only one arrested. To perfect the reader's pre-judgment, let's leave out the investigation and simply pose the question:\n\n\"Did a Foreigner Cause the Bloodbath in City X?\"\n\nSo, we avoid making a factual claim and instead ask a question.\n\nIn my opinion, something fundamental needs to change in the news culture of the internet. Online news media have a financial incentive to divide society and post sensational news. Otherwise, we will approach the end of democracy with eyes wide open.\n\n**Edit:** Thank you for pointing out the dark background behind the supposed Voltaire quote. It's quite ironic that I myself quote something sensationalistic and evidently didn't adequately research the origin of the quote.\n\n**Edit2:** Thank you first of all for the many comments. I believe the irony of my own post, as described by many here, has shown me that I've let myself be convinced by my own anger towards certain news outlets. It is indeed the case that I wrote this post after reading an article that had pushed me over the edge. Nevertheless, I don't want to delete this post. On one hand, I want to keep it for other Reddit users who may have also fallen victim to this blind anger. On the other hand, I don't want to erase the good arguments that have been written under this post. I want to make it clear once again: My view has definitely changed. The world is a bit more complex than for me to solely blame a single industry. Additionally, some of the media I criticized are under the influence of extremist forces (who created these websites themselves), making it unfair to hold the entire journalism accountable. Also, thanks for pointing out the difference between reporters and editors.",

  "selftext": "Mayo Clinic report defines narcissism as a personality disorder:  It is a mental condition in which people have an inflated sense of their own importance, a deep need for excessive attention and admiration, troubled relationships, and a lack of empathy for others. But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism.\n\nThere seems to me that most people these days have no curiosity or patience to try and connect to others in a meaningful way. The biggest reason to interact with others is to be affirmed and seen, but not to see the other persons. All feeling and emotions are shallow and fleeting and built on unrealistic fantasies. \n\nTo fall in love you have to be able to see other people as something other than a product to consume or a source of validation. To love you must be able to focus on someone other than yourself. We are constantly comparing everyone to everyone else and only the best is good enough.\n\nThere can be no acceptance of any negative feelings that may come from interacting with flesh and blood humans. The tolerance for any form of miscommunication or \"bad vibe\" is so incredibly low.\n\nAll of these shallow attitudes stems from narcissism, and narcissism is increasing in modern Western societies (some calls it an epidemic). We have a culture that promotes self-admiration, self-expression, and self-absorption at the expence of curiosity and intuition. The ego is to strong to accept the loss of control that comes with falling in love. The lack of empathy and the focus on the self make it impossible to build a healthy relationship that might lead to love. \n\nhttps://theconversation.com/why-are-we-becoming-so-narcissistic-heres-the-science-55773",

  "selftext": "I understand the idea behind quotas. Historically x group was discriminated against so there are fewer of X group in Y area and we should fix that by adding more of X group to Y area. And when looking at it from a group perspective, they make perfect sense. \n\nI don't like quotas for a couple of reasons. \n\nFirst, because it seems like when there's a mismatch between the representation of a group in society- say group A is 24% of the population and group B is 55% of the population- and the representation of a group in say a pool of applicants, the individuals in the group that is underrepresented in the pool have a better chance of getting the job solely because they are part of that underrepresented group. \n\nSecond, Quotas are not addressing the problem, they are countering it. If one group is overwhelmingly represented in a company because there is bias in favor of that group and against other groups and a bunch of managers of another group are added to the pool, the biased managers are still there. When those managers receive an application from somebody who is not part of their preferred group or are deciding who to promote, that bias will influence their decision. \n\nI think it would be far better to weed out the racism and the overt racists from the company instead and retrain managers who display a particular bias with their decisions (but aren't overtly racist.) The first step would be creating a welcoming company culture. The second step would be giving employees more tools to report racism. The third step- unfortunate but I don't see an alternative- would be analyzing managers hiring and promotion decisions. \n\nThis is not perfect and there would be pitfalls, but at least every individual would have a similar chance of being hired/promoted regardless of their race.

The foreign country is giving a discount to consumers and local government is denying it's people of this discount.

We are who we are as a combination of nature and nurture. \n\nSo how we decide and who we are, depends also on our genetics. Therefore, if your parents decided to have sex an hour layer, a different sperm would likely win the race (sperm cells are constantly dying and being replaced). \n\nThis would give you a different genetic predisposition and you would automatically perceive the world differently. And you can say the same for every single event that happened before our birth. All of it had an effect on what finally became us.\n\nSo then, how could the local bum make the same choice as Cindy Lou from across the street? Will the thought even come to him? \n\nWe have no free will, because we are limited and therefore so is our will.\n\nWe decide what we decide because we cannot decide differently.\n\nEven if we decide to change to be better, that was not a free will choice, merely the product of whatever happened to you combined with your genetic predisposition.",

I think a points and skill based system is the most ideal with some component of family reunification.\n\nMy argument is that having a significant minority (5-10% +) be Muslims is dangerous. The reason for this is multi-folded.\n\n1. Muslims and the Islamic world is anti-western and particularly anti-American. Letting people in that actively despise you is very questionable and will only lead to a resentful population. The Islamic world always has enough resentful (real and imagined).\n\n2. Europe shows that high levels of Muslim immigration is generally a net negative. British Pakistanis are a good example of this; the population is generally poorer, less educated, radicalized, welfare dependent and hostile. \n\nPakistani grooming gangs are a notable example: \n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/quilliam-grooming-gangs-report-asian-abuse-rotherham-rochdale-newcastle-a8101941.html\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherham_child_sexual_exploitation_scandal\n\nFrance is the European country with the highest portion of Muslim immigrants and many terror attacks including the recent Crepol stabbing attack shows that French Muslims are resentful and refuse to immigrate.\n\nSweden is another case where high level of Muslim\nImmigration has led to formation of gangs and gang violence \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swedish-pm-says-integration-immigrants-has-failed-fueled-gang-crime-2022-04-28/\n\n3.

Indian immigration  to the US, Canada and UK has been a massive success with many in these groups becoming very wealthy and contributing massively to respective societies.  \nNigerian Christian immigration has also been a success to the US. \n\n\nIn the end: morally, economically and socially it doesn’t benefit western countries to have a large Muslim population that will be resentful, criminal, and prone to violence. \n\nThat doesn’t mean that the west should be xenophobic, it should prioritize those that will integrate, embrace liberal and universal values and contribute positively to society.

The only other sources I'm willing to entertain are sources that appear to study the exact same topic but came back with DIFFERENT results. Studies on unrelated topics are outside of the scope here.\n\nHere's the study in question:\n\n[https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/](https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/)\n\nThe findings of this study in particular are critical, as I believe that these findings make the strongest case I'm aware of that gun laws in the United States do indeed help to reduce gun violence. It also refutes the claim that \"no evidence suggests that gun laws reduce gun violence.\" This study does exactly that, and I think it makes that case better than any other evidence I've seen out there. Simply put, anyone who wants to proceed with the claim that gun laws don't reduce gun violence needs to explain the findings of this study, full stop, or else they are being willfully dishonest.\n\nLet me address a few criticisms I think I will find:\n\n\\- *The study was probably done by a biased institution*. Here's the thing: half of this data is verifiable by your own understanding of American politics, and the other half is just data that anyone can look up. This study makes a correlation between the strength of gun laws and the number of people who died due to gun violence. Regarding the former, the strength of gun laws, I firmly believe that anyone should be able to look at the states and how they are ranked in terms of how strict their gun laws are and realize that the classifications do indeed make sense. Blue states seem to have tighter restrictions. Red states don't. None of that is surprising. And the number of gun deaths? Well either a person was shot to death, or they weren't, right? So this isn't really subject to debate. The data was likely pulled from law enforcement records, so I feel like the only people who you could blame for messing up the data would be these law enforcement officers determining whether or not a person died because of a bullet wound. I just...don't see any real reason to think they'd massively screw that task up, ESPECIALLY not with the intent of biasing the results of a gun control study conducted by Everytown.\n\n\\- *The data shows results for a single point in time, whereas the more interesting data is temporal.* That is true, but if you think about it, you can't really come up with a good reason for why a state that had a low amount of gun violence would suddenly start implementing a bunch of gun laws. If there's no danger to their state, then what's causing them to do this? It's just not a convincing angle in my mind.\n\n\\- *Correlation is not causation*. Sure, but I'm not calling this an iron-clad case by any means. But I am saying it is \"convincing\". If this were confounded by some other variable, you'd have to tell me what that variable is and how it could explain the correlation, and I have yet to hear of a convincing one that would completely blow this correlation up. I don't know how you can just toss out a generic \"correlation is not causation\" here without that logically extending to every single regression analysis ever performed in the history of humanity. ESPECIALLY whichever ones support *your* viewpoint!\n\nTL;DR: this source in particular is a cornerstone of the argument that gun laws do indeed lower gun violence, and I see no reason not to think that it demonstrates exactly that.

So much is contingent upon the willpower of person you’re trying to help. You can give them all the help you can but unless *they* truly want to get clean/get off the street there’s nothing you can do. \n\nAnd that gets frustrating and ultimately leads to burnout. \n\nCare for the mentally ill and elderly is equally tough because no matter what way you slice it wiping the hairy, puckered asshole of an 85 year old combative dementia patient is never going to be fun. Its not work that you need a degree for but it needs doing no matter what. And no boy/girl dreams of growing up and doing that for a living. Take it from me, my sister has done it for 10 years at a nursing home and it sucks no matter what. \n\nSome people say it’s a shame we put our elderly into places like that but my aunt once had to help with her dad’s (my grandfather) catheter by adjusting it for him and she told my mom she was deeply disturbed and felt a profound sense of violation at doing it. \n\nAnd I can relate to do that. We foist these jobs on other people because they’re unrewarding and mentally draining. I know people will say it’s matter of compensation but look at countries trying to raise their fertility rates. We have examples of numerous governments passing incentives to try and get young couples to have children. This is one of most quintessentially human things to do, with a partner you love and even with cash benefits being dangled in front of peoples faces you can’t get them to reproduce. \n\nI don’t see why throwing more cash at something like counseling will make it any less appealing.",

It's purely theoretical. \n\nI've heard the question \"why don't we just kill ourselves?\" thrown around in a lot of subreddits lately. And the responses people offer are varied, particularly with people who said they aren't religious. Christians and muslims tend to have the exact same answer no matter what which is essentially \"god forbids it and we would be damned to hell.\" \n\nNow the way I see it, every human \\*needs\\* a reason to live. Something that keeps them going. And this is where I think Christianity and Islam get it perfect because god is said to be infinite along with his punishment. So when a human being accepts god into their heart, an entity that always is, they can be rest assured knowing they will NEVER run out of hope. They are also fearful of his wrath if they disobey this one command god has. \n\nWith secular people however, it seems like their reasons for not just giving up and calling it quits on life comes down to one thing that they like the most. It could be their kid, their pet, their friends, their curiosity to explore the world, video games, etc etc etc. But these reasons are all finite and so it gets me thinking... if one of these things that give secular people their reason for living vanishes, which they all do, does that mean they've lost their will to live? Do they have to find something else or do they feel empty for the remainder of their lives? \n\nI hope my opinion makes sense.",

  "selftext": "In my opinion, biryani should be the national dish of India.\n\nMy 1st reason is that it is universally loved by all Indians, and no state can really 'possess' it like how Odisha 'possesses' rasugulla and West Bengal 'possesses' fuchka. This means that every single state of India has their own variety of biryani. Therefore, almost every Indian has the opportunity to try biryani, since it is therefore, widespread everywhere as well. This means that there won't be jealousy from any other state similar how Odisha and West Bengal fight over roshgollas and rasugullas and manner of debate over the origins of pani puri, fushka, and golgappa are from. Moreso, biryani has many different varieties, designed for a plethora of different Indians who are used to the taste to different dishes.\n\nMy 2nd reason is that biryani has so many different varieties and flavours! You may say that most of them are similar in taste, but let me prove you wrong via a simple comparision of the Bengali biryani and the Hyderabadi biryani. The Bengali biriyani has potatos and eggs in them, along with a few herbs and nuts, which gives it a rather sweet and refreshing taste! However, the southern-born Hyderabadi biryani has an abundance of spices in them, which results in it having, you guessed it, a rather spicy and umami taste! No 2 dishes can be more different than one being sweet and refreshing, and the other being spicy and umami! However, both of them are a type of biryani. The only difference is that the former originated in West Bengal and the latter in Telengana. This shows the vast plethora of tastes that will be respected if biryani becomes the national dish of India!\n\nMy 3rd reason is that biryani is a balanced diet in itself. A balanced diet comprises of 6 main components; with only 5 being found in solid food, which biryani is; proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, minerals and water. The 1st component, protein, is found in biryani via basmati rice. The 2nd component, carbohydrates, is found in biryani via potatoes, herbs, etc. The 3rd compinent, lipids, can be found in biryani via fish, chicken, mutton, etc. The 4th component, vitamins, are found in biryani via carrots, herbs, etc. The 5th component, minerals can be found in biryani via eggs.\n\nThese reasons are the reasons why I believe biryani should be India's national dish.",

From our perspective, dating opens the door to a lot of messy situations either towards ourselves or our partners. For instance, people who with mental health issues are vulnerable to abusive situations and partners who can easily take advantage of us to their liking. I've experienced and seen what this lack of discernment and healthy boundaries can cause. It can make it so we end in an abusive cycle with a narcissist who preys upon the victim's inability to fend for themselves, as their trauma and illness makes it easier to manipulate them and harder for them to leave the situation. Now, from the partner's perspective, a lot of people with trauma can end up becoming abusive towards their partner and not even realize until it's too late. If you’re not aware of your toxic tendencies you can easily become the abuser and cause havoc in your relationship. Mental health is not an excuse to be toxic towards others, specially your loved ones. So, I believe that unless you’re healthy or are have healed considerably your traumas and toxic behaviors, you should NOT be dating. ",

Why the election? A poll recently came out saying that a majority of Iowa Republican voters believe the 2020 elected from rigged. When people lose face in the election system, they might turn to alternative means of getting their candidate in power, as they already tried in 2021 with Jan 6.\n\nI think Republican congressmen and states will refuse to accept the results of the election and stage a much more violent and extreme version of January 6, this will cause the country to split and chaos to ensue. If part of the military defects then it’ll be a full blown war. If not, then things could still get pretty violent in an insurgency. I don’t see any indication of this not happening since they refused to condemn the events of January 6 and have been continually escalating the rhetoric. \n\nPossible counter arguments I’ll address here:\n\n-People are too comfortable - yes, most people are happy to be on their new iPhones and so on, but there’s a non-insignificant part of the population that is extremely angry and on the edge, it doesn’t take a huge group to cause chaos. There doesn’t need to be a huge economic downturn for this to occur, there wasn’t a huge recession before the U.S. civil war from 1860.\n\n-There isn’t a clear geographic split like in 1860, right and left are mixed together. While this is true, there are still geographic divisions today. And even in 1860, a lot of people either wanted nothing to do with the war or actively sympathized with the other side, like copperheads. \n\nAgain, I really hope this doesn’t happen and I hope you’ll convince me that I shouldn’t worry about this.",

Consequently, one cannot make a logically valid moral claim. I define a moral claim as being a statement that says one ought to or should do something without giving a specified goal.\n\n\"One ought not to kill in order to stay out of prison\" is an example of an ought statement with a specified goal and therefore in my view, logically valid.\n\n\"One ought not to kill\" does not have a specified goal and is therefore not logically valid.\n\nI think the closest one-word description of my view would be \"emotivism\" meaning I see any ought claim to just be an expression of one's like or dislike for a given event. This may just sound like an argument from incredulity but I simply don't see how an ought can be derived from an is.\n\nSecondly, I'd like to quickly address a couple of common rebuttals to my argument.\n\nThere's the theological position that claims god to be the arbiter of morality. Why is god the arbiter of morality? Some may say that god knows of a sort of universal moral truth that humanity is unaware of, this doesn't hold up for me either. My main objection is that there is no evidence for this, even if we look at scripture. This also contradicts the idea of god's omnipotence and is in contradiction of the \"can't derive an is from an ought\" principle and creates a paradox of sorts.\n\nThere is also the utilitarian position that even if there is no universal moral truth, we can come to an agreement on what we ought to do. This agreement is said to be based on the common desire for the maximisation of pleasure and the minimisation of pain and that if everyone agrees that one thing is best, then it is incorrect to act otherwise as even you agree that that course of action is best. My issue with this is that people do not desire the maximisation of pleasure of all, just the maximisation of their own pleasure and this argument conflates the two.\n\nThis is my honest understanding of both arguments so if I've got anything wrong please correct me!\n\nI'm looking for someone to either demonstrate that there is a flaw in my view, provide a more convincing version of the counterarguments I have described, or provide a completely different counterexample.",

For example, \"he's a white billionaire that beats up poor people.\" Okay, for one, Batman beats up other white billionaires too, Penguin, and the other crime bosses that he goes against are white billionaires, and they actively poison Gotham and do more damage to the poor in Gotham with their criminal organizations, and the street thugs Batman beats up are actively trying to hurt and kill other people; it's kind of his job to stop them.\n\nEven if they are poor, these people are still choosing to mug or rob someone. It doesn't give them an excuse if Batman is on the roof and sees a man about to mug a pregnant woman. Is Batman supposed to be like, \"Oh, he's poor, so the fact that he's poking a gun at a pregnant woman is justified?\" No, he should stop them. My point is that class doesn't and shouldn't matter if you are a criminal rich or poor; you should be stopped. If someone is trying to steal from me or hurt me, I would want someone to stop them and help me. I don't care if that person is a billionaire or a poor person. Please stop the criminal from attempting to hurt me.\n\nBruce Wayne actually does help Gotham with his wealth; that's what all his non-profit organizations are for, and he treats and pays all his employees very nicely. That's why I kind of cringed at the line in The Flash (2022) movie when Batman had the lasso of truth. I get that it was supposed to be a joke, but it didn't make sense to me because Bruce Wayne does a bunch of stuff for Gotham with his wealth, but let's be honest, no one wants to see a Batman story where the entire story is Bruce Wayne at non-profits and doing stuff with his wealth to help Gotham. A lot of people want to see Batman in the Batmobile fighting crime, and I don't know why this argument gets used against Batman and not any other billionaire superhero.\n\nI also don't think it makes sense for Thomas Wayne to be corrupt. The Wayne family comes from old money. Thomas inherits his wealth, so for him to be a crime boss makes no sense. I could understand if he wasn't a billionaire and went through exploitative, corrupt means to get his billions, but he didn't. The Wayne family ancestors may have been corrupt and exploited people, but Thomas and Bruce didn't do anything except be born, so like I said, it doesn't make sense for Thomas to be a crime boss and Bruce to be evil.\n\nThomas Wayne wasn't the CEO of Wayne Enterprise; he was the owner and maybe a CEO in a figurehead type of way, but he was a surgeon first and foremost, so it doesn't make sense for him to be corrupt. I have also heard the argument that Batman glorifies billionaires and that we shouldn't like Batman because he glorifies rich people. This doesn't make any sense to me at all. Like I said, why does this only apply to Batman and no other billionaire hero? Also, Bruce Wayne didn't do anything; he was born into a rich family and inherited their wealth. That is, he didn't do anything wrong. And if Batman wasn't a billionaire, then his story wouldn't make sense. People would ask, \"How does a regular person leave town at 17, train for a bunch of years, come back, and be able to afford all these suits, gadgets, and cars?\" \n\nI'm pretty sure Bruce donates his wealth a lot more than any other rich superhero like Iron Man, Green Arrow, et cetera. Another argument that doesn't make sense to me is \"He recruits children!\" Every single superhero has recruited a child. Bucky was a literal child in the comics, and Captain America brought him along to fight Nazis in World War II. Every member of the Justice League has a kid sidekick, and before you say, \"Well, they have powers,\" it doesn't matter if a child is put in active danger; it doesn't matter if they have powers or not. The last time I checked, the Teen Titans were kids fighting grown adult villains, and the Titans can still die. I don't know why these arguments get used against Batman, and no one else.\n\nI feel like these arguments are stupid, and the people who use them don't know anything about Batman. I feel like these people have seen clips of Batman from movies and TV shows and think they know everything about characters, and I really don't understand why these arguments only get used against Batman and not any other rich superhero but feel free to CMV.",

  "selftext": "I am not a vegan or even a vegetarian. Many vegans argue that it's so hypocritical that so many people say they love animals but continue to eat them that results in an industry that creates a horrible quality of life for livestock. Logically, I agree with them. I love my cat. I love my parents dog. But honestly I don't think it's fair for me to say I love animals in general when I can't give up meat to help contribute to a better quality of life for them. I live in a city where it would be extremely easy for me to vegetarian or vegan, but I simply like eating meat too much to give it up. I've seen Dominion and a few other docs that show how awful the industry is... and while it upset me, I just couldn't give up meat. I have cut back on red meat and pork and try to only shop for poultry now for environmental reasons, and grown chickens and turkeys kind of disgust me so I feel zero guilt about eat them.\n\nI'd like this view changed because I do want to believe I'm an animal lover but I really can't reconcile that with the fact that I partake in the meat industry.\n\nEDIT: Thinking about it I think this going to be hard to change my mind because 'love' is such an abstract concept to begin with. I appreciate the discussions so far. A popular one is that if ate ethically sourced meat. I agree that is a lot better to cut down on suffering and definitely more empathetic I'm just not sure it shows 'love' to still be choosing to kill them for food.\n\nEDIT 2: It's amazing how many people are changing this into whether or not I should be vegan.

  "selftext": "Freekicks are on average scored about  6% of the time. They are not great scoring chances, though they can be very spectacular. I think eliminating the barrier would help free kicks be better scoring chances with more options available. Currently, there are two ways to utilize a free kick: you use it for a cross, or you try to go over the wall. In the past you could sometimes go under the wall, but in the modern game there are players placed there so it can't happen. This makes free kicks pretty limited. \n\nObviously, simply eliminating the barrier would make free kicks pretty overpowered especially if they're on the edge of the box. That'd incite players to fish for fouls around that area more often. The solution I think is to ony apply the rule when enough distance is in place. Currently, the barrier has to be set 9,15 meters away from the ball. I'd propose to only allow a barrier if it can be placed within the box. That would mean that close up freekicks would remain fair, but freekicks from longer range would be much more dangerous chances.\n\nEDIT: To add some more context, there has been talk of increasing the size of goals to make long shots and freekicks better scoring chances as well (Buffon mentioned it recently). However this would require a change in football fields all around the world that may not be economically viable for very small, local clubs.",

  "title": "CMV: Israel is a colonial project",
  "selftext": "A colony traditionally means that a foreign body encroaches on another people's land in pursuit of domination either by controlling (exploitation colonization) or replacing (settler colonization) the indigenous inhabitants.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Theodor Herzl started the call for the modern zionist movement in 1896 to establish a national homeland for the jews in Palestine, jews at that time constituted a very small minority in Palestine. Jewish immigration started to increase after the movement and their number was estimated at 56,000 in 1918. The immigration specifically skyrocketed after Balfour declaration in 1917 that by 1939, the Jewish population had increased to 445,000. [Source](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-206581/)\r  \n\r  \nSo, it is an obvious case of settler colonization that can't be refuted but some people may argue that if the settler is the true indigenous population then it is not colonization. This can be refuted by:\r  \n\r  \n1) Even if modern-day palestenians started to settle in the region after the jews that doesn't mean that they aren't indigenous; I don't know what makes you indigenous more than living continuously in the same area for about 2000 years. By that same logic, modern-day americans have no place in America because they are the descendants of europeans who invaded the region 300 years ago when the land belonged to the indigenous amirican population.\r  \n\r  \n2) The plot twist, but an obvious thing, is that genetically palestinians are direct descendants of the ancient Israelites; they are jews who converted to christianity and then converted to islam. They are more ethnically israelites than most large jewish groups especailly askenazi jews whose europian ancestry is more than 50% while palestinian muslims have arab ancestory of only 20 to 30%. It is more striking when in comparison, palestinian muslims are more genetically close to askinazi jews than Saudi arabs, but yemenite jews are more arab than palestinian muslims. [Source](https://twitter.com/MiroCyo/status/1712258026881921287?s=20): (mega analysis of several research papers of dna material of several sources compiled into a database summarized in this thread).\r  \n\r  \nIn light of these facts and logical assumptions, there is no way to state that the jews have a distinctive or better claim to the land of palestine more than palestinians EXCEPT if:\r  \n\r  \n1) You strongly sympathize with the jews because of the holaucost in europe and their long persecution there; which is very good and healthy thing to do but what have this to do with the palestinians? They werent the ones to persecute them in europe, so they dont have to atone for the mistakes and atrocities of europeans with their land and lives. If someone owes to compensate them then they should be europeans specifically germans. Why didn't they give them a piece of their land to build a Jewish-majority state?\r  \n\r  \n2) You dont view palestinians as equal humans and thus you think it is okay to take away their rights to solve the jewish problem of europe without europeans being affected that much; a “small” price to pay for salvation.\r  \n\r  \nFrom what I have seen recently it seems that most pro-israel westerners have the combination of both points with the emphasis on the dehumanization of palesteninans; because if you (european and americans) sympathized with the jews, then the centuries-old persecution of jews that climaxed in their genocide in europe wouldn't have happened in the first place and you would have accepted them in your countries instead of easing and encouraging their immigration to the middle east from europe even after the holocaust.\r  \n\r  \nSo, are there other option or pov that can change this view?",

I think that it would be good to have more than just two opinions and in the digital age I think that's gonna be more than possible and it's gonna make the child's life more democratic if well planned and implemented.\r  \n\r  \nI think the subreddit r/AmItheAsshole inspiring because there you can see other people's opinions of someone's personal life and we're talking often 1000s of opinions. Imagine if there was an annual parental review or even a quarterly, monthly review of the child's psychological wellbeing which would then give the child to set up a review of the quality of his or her parents' parenting with 1000s of people being paid to participate in the verdict. If the verdict is that the parents have hurt the child then the child can have a 3rd parent paid for by the government who will have daily calls with the child to see how the child is getting on and also have their say in whether or not the child deserves to be lets say grounded. Then if the child's wellbeing approves in the next review, the parents will have a chance to be left to their own devices to maintain the same level of wellbeing for the child that there was with a 3rd parent involved.\r  \n\r  \nTake the 2nd paragraph with a pinch of salt though. The point of this post is that I'm very unsure about how safe it is to leave a child's life & development all in the hands of just two people and whether in the digital age we can have more healthy and diverse opinions.

  "title": "CMV: The United States should not defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.",
  "selftext": "Taiwan has been a focal point of Chinese-American tension since the inception of the People’s Republic. I have read several articles arguing that we should defend Taiwan in the event of military invasion.\n\nExamples:\n\n[https://time.com/6221072/why-protecting-taiwan-really-matters-to-the-u-s/](https://time.com/6221072/why-protecting-taiwan-really-matters-to-the-u-s/)\n\n[https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/03/american-power-and-the-defense-of-taiwan/](https://www.fpri.org/article/2023/03/american-power-and-the-defense-of-taiwan/)\n\nI think this would be a significant mistake for several reasons.\n\n1.) A war between the United States and China could easily escalate into something terribly destructive. Both powers have nuclear weapons and the world’s strongest militaries. Millions of lives would be at risk from long-range bombers, drone strikes, cyber-espionage, and other irregular forms of warfare. While the United States may be physically safe from invasion, the damage could still be horrific.\n\nIf we’re to fight such a war, it should be over a threat to the United States or its treaty-obligated allies. Not Taiwan.\n\n2. Taiwan can defend itself. It is a highly developed economy with a strong military and impressive stockpile of weapons provided by the United States. China will need to cross a strait and then land troops on a handful of defended beaches. Airborne operations would need to contend with SAMs and other air defenses. The balance of force may change in China’s favor eventually, but it’s still dubious whether an invasion would succeed.\n\n3. Taiwan, while important, is not absolutely essential to the United States. I understand the criticality of semiconductor manufacturing. It’s not worth a third World War, which would impoverish us with far greater efficiency than loss of semiconductors - assuming we would completely lose access.\n\n4. The idea that China will continue to invade other countries (if we do not stop them in Taiwan) does not seem realistic. China has been the world’s foremost power for centuries. In many ways, the ascendancy of other powers has been an aberration. Never have the Chinese sought to extend their domination beyond their immediate sphere.\n\nHistory is no guarantee of the future. But I don’t think China has the ability to physically threaten the United States (outside of nuclear weapons or cyberwarfare). China may ascend to global hegemony, but as the United States demonstrated, that is not all it’s cracked up to be.\n\n5. Our security umbrella is already vast. We have mutual defense agreements with many countries. I would argue we’re already overstretched as is without further commitments, and we can’t be sure of European material support.\n\n6. China does have a legitimate claim to Taiwan. It wasn’t a province of imperial China for as long as, say, Gansu or Sichuan. However, it’s still been part of China for hundreds of years. A little over a third of Taiwan’s people favor closer relations with China, though of course most oppose closer political ties.\n\n(https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/05/12/in-taiwan-views-of-mainland-china-mostly-negative/)\n\nNow, I don’t mean to say that China’s claim overrides Taiwan’s sovereignty or the democratic will of its people. What I mean to say is that the CCP has been signaling all its existence that they will take Taiwan back. We basically guarantee a fight if we commit ourselves to Taiwan’s defense.\n\nThat said, I am open to changing my view firstly because on its face, allowing China to just seize Taiwan by coercion is a bad outcome. It may be the lesser of two evils, but it’s miserable for people in Taiwan who favor independence.\n\nIn addition, many Americans are in favor of defending Taiwan. There are probably reasons out there I missed.\n\n(https://globalaffairs.org/sites/default/files/2021-08/2021%20Taiwan%20Brief.pdf). There is a case for intervention, and maybe I am missing a piece of the puzzle.\n\nAddendum:\n\nIt is possible China will blockade the island to force its submission - I don’t think the United States should attempt to break a blockade militarily, either.\n\nEDIT: I awarded a delta to someone pointing out that Taiwan can’t actually defend itself for long under naval blockade unless we break the cordon by force - effectively a declaration of war. Maybe China would hesitate to fire on neutral ships, but if they actually commit to an invasion, I don’t think anything unarmed can get through.\n\nBasically, not breaking the blockade means ceding the war. That undermines my second point.\n\nEDIT2: In retrospect, coming to Reddit for a measured foreign policy discussion was foolhardy, even for me.",

  "selftext": "I am very willing and open to change my mind on this. First of all I feel like this is kind of a privileged take that some people have without actually living in an area with a large homeless population.\n\nWell I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. \n\nAnti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.\n\nBut getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming. I’m not saying that I don’t care about the homeless people, but there’s a time and place.\n\n\nEdit: Wow. I appreciate the people actually trying to change my view, but this is more towards the people calling me a terrible person and acting as if I don’t care about homeless people…\n\nFirst of all my friends and I volunteer regularly at the homeless shelters.\nIf you actually listen to what I’m saying, you’ll realize that I’m not just trying to get homeless people out of sight and out of mind. My point is that public architecture is a really weird place to have discourse about homeless people.\n\n“I lock my door at night because I live in a high crime neighborhood.”\n\n- “Umm, why? It’s only a high crime neighborhood because your city is neglectful and doesn’t help the people in the neighborhood.”\n\n“Okay? So what? I’m not saying that I hate poor people for committing more crime…I’m literally just locking my door. The situations of the robbers doesn’t change the fact that I personally don’t want to be robbed.”\n\n\n\nEDIT #2\n\nThe amount of privilege and lack of critical thinking is blowing my mind. I can’t address every single comment so here’s some general things. \n\n1. “Put the money towards helping homelessness instead!” \n\nPublic benches are a fraction of the price. Cities already *are* putting money towards helping the homeless. The architecture price is a fart in the wind. Ironically, it’s the same fallacy as telling a homeless person “why are you buying a phone when you should be buying a house?”\n\n2. Society is punishing homeless people and trying to make it impossible for them to live.\n\nWrong. It’s not about punishing homeless people, it’s about making things more enjoyable for non homeless people. In the same way that prisons aren’t about punishing the criminals, they are about protecting the non criminals. (Or at least, that’s what they *should* be about.)\n\n3. “They have no other choice!”\n\nI’m sorry to say it, but this just isn’t completely true. And it’s actually quite simple: homelessness is bad for the economy, it does not benefit society in any way. It’s a net negative for everyone. So there’s genuinely no reason for the government *not* to try and help homeless people.\n\nBecause guess what? Homeless people are expensive. A homeless person costs the government 50k dollars a year. If a homeless person wants to get off the streets, it’s in the gov’s best interest to do everything they can to help. The government is genuinely desperate to end homelessness, and they have no reason NOT to be. This is such a simple concept. \n\nAnd once again, if y’all had any *actual* interactions with homeless people, you would realize that they aren’t just these pity parties for you to fetishize as victims of capitalism. They are real people struggling with something that prevents them from getting help. The most common things I’ve seen are drug abuse and severe mental illness. The PSH housing program has a 98% rehabilitation rate. The people who are actually committing to getting help are receiving help.",

The lack of empathy and sympathy toward their struggle and what they view as disenchantment by large corporations is very real and I think in that sense by referring to it as AI “art” we are disenfranchising the very real and very personal mental and emotional struggle along with the artistic journey of millions of artists.\n\nI think the fundamental differences in these arguments stem from technical accuracy, which is focused on by pro-AI; seen with arguments on how AI art technically doesn’t steal art. And human impact, which is focused on by anti-ai showing how it disenfranchises some artists. The disagreement I think isn’t weather the technology can make art, it’s if the technology should. Instead of the argument boiling down to “is AI art inherently bad?” I think the argument should boil down to essentially “should AI art exist?” Or “does it provide a net benefit?”\n\nTo change my view: you’d either need to provide evidence that the average artist has a deeper understanding of AI technology than presented, AI itself inherently steals art by it’s technical processes or my understanding of the arguments brought forth by both sides are incorrect. I would also be swayed by alternative convincing arguments. Thanks!",

  "selftext": "[Edit: Managed to thread the needle between pissing off defenders of Israel who don't think genocide should be in the conversation, and also pissing of those who think I haven't gone far enough. That's a good day on Reddit]  \n\nI’m not going to go into an especially elaborate throat-clearing about the horrors of 10/7, I think (hope?) that most reasonable people are on the same page about how atrocious and horrifying that was. \n\nListening to the ICJ presentation by South Africa is absolutely harrowing. No one with a conscience can possibly defend or wave away the atrocities that are happening in Gaza. \n\nThe case is incredibly strong but for one crucial element: intent. South Africa presented a mountain of compelling evidence about the genocidal language and attitudes permeating Israeli society, media, government and military, but intent in genocide is an incredibly high bar that I don’t believe has yet been demonstrated, despite the widespread attitudes that very clearly exist to that end in Israel. \n\nFor me, it comes down to intent in command decisions. There is strong inference that soldiers on the ground are taking words of government leaders (Bibi: Amalek, Bougie: no innocent civilians, and others) as carte blanche to kill everything that moves, but the preponderance of evidence still points to this war being a stew of crimes against humanity and war crimes, with *the aim* of eradicating Hamas while *not caring at all* how many innocent Palestinians die. \n\nWe still don’t have enough information to conclude that this war is being prosecuted with the intent to *destroy* the people of Gaza for its own sake. (Though I believe we do have enough evidence, in the form of reporting on private conversations in government about reducing the number of Palestinians in Gaza through exodus after the war, of ethnic cleansing)\n\nThe conditions that have (deliberately) been created in Gaza are genocidal, and Israel’s actions amount to genocide in all but name, but that name is important. I think as more information emerges in the months/years to come, we may well see evidence of acts of genocide on the ground by the IDF (judging by near non-existent rules of engagement as highlighted by the murder of unarmed hostages waving a white flag), but at this point I don’t think we’ve seen that evidence yet.\n\nIn past genocides, the commands have been to kill people for its own sake. We don't yet have the information to conclude that here yet. Or do we?",

  "selftext": "I’ve seen quite a few arguments/complaints online about how modern men are very lonely and how it’s more difficult, statistically, to get into a relationship. I suspect these studies to be skewed towards city life and/or criminally online people, and I’d go as far as to say it’s easier to date for all genders.\n\nThis is why I think it’s easier to date compared to even 20-30 years ago:\n\n1) The bar has fallen:\n\n the traditional/stereotype of partners has been dissolving and I don’t see conventional pairings as often. Women more and more are breadwinners, sexually liberated, independent, strong spirited. Men are being allowed to be more feminine, expressive, vulnerable. Not to say women have stopped being women or men have stopped being men. But there is a lot more flexibility to what kind of person you can be and what you can do, which opens up the dating pool.\n\n2) Ugly ain’t ugly no more:\n\nWhen I look at pictures/portraits/film of the last century, it’s tough. Lot of face cards being rejected. The only saving grace for the past is that they were in better physical shape. They were also starving and choking on smog 24/7 and it shows. \n\nModern people are hot. They are healthier, less nutrient deficiency + curvy/more built, they are more well spoken with pretty good personalities. I might be a bit of a thot in this regard but I’d say 9/10 of women I see everyday I would make love to.\n\n3) Personal experience: \n\nI’m not the best looking guy, and I was terrified I’d never lose my virginity. Then I got scared I wouldn’t even have a relationship. It was a rough couple years.\n\nThen my friend nonchalantly told me to add one of the friends of a girl he was talking to. Had my first relationship within 2 weeks. Had a couple more before losing the V card.\n\nGet to college, anxiety returns. Just put it to the side and hung out with a bunch of people and had fun cuz college. 4 relationships over the course of 5 years, and casual hookups. \n\nGirls have overwhelming been attractive with great personalities. They’ve always looked past my shortcomings and my confidence has gone up a lot over the years. \n\nConclusion:\n\nThe narrative I see online doesn’t add up to the real world. People have become nicer, more open, and more eager to explore. I’m not a nice guy, not attractive, not rich. I’m just honest and talk to people.\n\nI strongly believe I would’ve been a massive loser like 20-30 years ago. I feel like most of my friends have been in similar situations.",

  "title": "CMV: Committing a crime against a vulnerable victim is not inherently worse.",
  "selftext": "I feel like instinctually it feels worse when a crime is committed against a vulnerable person like a child, disabled or elderly person, but I can't square that logically in a way that I can articulate. That is, I'm having a hard time coming up with a logical reason explaining why we all tend to have a visceral reaction that makes crimes against the extremely vulnerable feel worse.\n\nI can think of a few reasons why we could say this, but I feel like they all fail when examined critically:\n\n1. Vulnerable people have higher worth/rights. I don't feel like this makes sense. Liberal tradition holds that all people have equal rights. While certain crimes, such as the murder of a child could be argued to be worse because of the amount of expected years remaining, nobody ever says \"well that old guy getting murdered isn't a big deal because he probably would've croaked on his own in a couple years anyway.\"\n2. It is easier to commit the crime. Difficulty of committing a crime is not really a pretext for how bad a crime is. In general, the criminal justice system tends to actually punish people worse for more difficult to commit crimes. If you steal an unattended phone of a table in a restaurant, you'll probably get a lighter sentence than if you managed to wrestle it out of the hands of a Navy SEAL. Crime isn't an RPG where you get more XP for committing more difficult crimes with the same net result. In general, my observation is that society tends to look down on crimes of opportunity (i.e. low difficulty crimes) less than those that are plotted and overcome obstacles, until you reach some arbitrary point of vulnerability, and then we get the visceral heinous crime reaction, which I don't think makes sense.\n3. The victim is defenseless. Almost all experts, police, etc. will advise you that resisting a crime is usually unwise if compliance/retreat is possible and you have a reasonable suspicion that you will survive. If we believed this, we would logically treat all crime like a spectrum based on the \"difficulty level\" of the victim, which we don't. People don't say, \"that guy successfully mugged a concealed-carrying, heavyweight MMA fighter, so fair play to him.\" We generally don't consider a crime against, e.g. an overweight 55 year old man, any worse than one against a healthy 25 year old man. Yet we would consider a crime against someone in a wheelchair to be in the heinous crime against vulnerable victim category, but it's really like comparing an NFL team to a D3 college team vs. a high school team - neither one has a fighting chance. Realistically, most people, even if not vulnerable enough for the crime to cause a visceral reaction due to their vulnerability, don't really have a decent chance of physically resisting a crime by a healthy young man, and shouldn't be expected to do so. 1. Similarly to #2, overcoming difficulty to successfully commit a crime doesn't change the impact of the crime on the victim. Yet, when a certain level of vulnerability is reached, it somehow feels worse for a way that I can't articulate, and I'm not sure that makes logical sense.\n4. A vulnerable victim would experience greater trauma or impact from the crime. This one makes sense in certain circumstances, but I don't think it applies across the board. Sure, robbing an elderly pensioner *could* cause significantly greater hardship than a person in the prime of their career, but that's not always the case. The impact of the crime is far more complex than some kind of relationship to the victim's vulnerability.\n\nSo to CMV, you'll need to articulate a logical reason why we get this feeling that crime against vulnerable people is worse, explain why my logic above is wrong, or list another reason that I overlooked.\n\nNote: There are clearly some crimes, such as statutory rape, that can by definition only be committed against a vulnerable victim, so citing those is not going to CMV, as I'm only talking about equivalent acts that we see as worse because of who the victim is.",

  "selftext": "For context, I'm a \"person of color\" myself so part of this does come from my personal experience with dating apps and the likes.  \n\nI see a lot of people opposing race filters/preference settings on dating apps because it's \"racist\" that you only want to date within your race, or only want to date specific races.   \n\nThe fact that I disagree with this aside (this isn't what the CMV post is for so please don't try to CMV on me thinking racial preferences are *not* racist), I think that the existence of people who only want to date certain races regardless of the ethics of said preference just makes it *more important* that racial preferences exist on dating apps - not for *their* benefit, *but for the benefit of everyone else.* Why? Because everyone else won't be wasting swipes/likes on people who automatically write them off because of their race/ethnicity.  \n\nI'm a brown guy but I'm open to dating outside of my race - but a lot of women I know, even ones I'm friends with, say they probably wouldn't date a brown guy. So on dating apps without ethnic preferences, I'm always worrying that I'm wasting my swipes/likes on people who are not even going to consider me regardless of how good my profile, prompts and photos are, and that I could've used that like on someone who may actually be interested in me. But without an ethnic filter that would hide the profiles of anyone who isn't interested in me based on my race, I have no clue if I'm wasting swipes or not.      \n\nAdding an ethnic filter wouldn't just make it so that their experience on these apps would be better, it would also make **my** experience and the experience of everyone who *doesn't* have a racial dating preference better, because they will not be wasting swipes on people with preferences they don't fit, and those people will also not feel inconvenienced by getting likes from people who they are not attracted to. It's a win-win for everyone.  \n\nThe only \"argument\" I've seen when this point has been brought up is that it can make people with strict ethnic preferences \"rethink\" those preferences if they see someone they find attractive of an ethnicity they wouldn't usually date. But I think this is pretty unlikely and it's honestly kind of naive to think a dating app would change someone's preferences this heavily, and it shouldn't be a dating app's responsibility or obligation to do this or attempt to do it anyways. And again it inconveniences *everyone* because people of other races waste swipes on people who aren't interested in them, and that person is also having to swipe left on a bunch of extra people they're not interested in as well.  \n\nSo to conclude, yeah, even if you believe having an ethnic preference for dating is wrong, evil and racist, allowing them to filter out ethnicities they don't want to date *helps* those ethnicities because they are not going to be wasting their likes (most dating apps limit the amount of likes you have without paying) on people who are automatically not going to be interested in them because of their race, and gives them more likes to use on people who are at least open to dating them.",

This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216)).  Per the FAO, animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.\r  \n\r  \nWe need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America.  We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the most common rebuttals to the above is a plant-based diet isn't healthy, and therefore isn't a viable solution for sustainability.  In fact, it can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating.  My country (USA) gets 150-200% of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and [its position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.  I say this to focus the discussion around other topics that are much more likely to change my view.\n\nCorporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.\n\n\rThe dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal.  It's true that diet is a personal choice, so I hold it is better to choose a diet that is much more sustainable than what we're currently eating.\r  \n\r\r",

I used to think that only Kenya's politicians use ethnicity to get votes and I was surprised to see that even in liberal democracies like the U.S. and Germany there are these types of politicians.\n\nFor example in the U.S there is a lot of talk about the black vote, hispanic vote and the evangelical vote, the white vote e.t.c. \n\nThe school I went to in Nairobi (the capital city) was multi-ethnic/multi-religious meaning I interacted a lot with people from different faiths, people who spoke different languages from mine and people who had different cultural practices. My best friend was from a different ethnicity, and when I was in university I even dated a muslim girl. \n\nBy the time I became an adult I had already accepted that people were the same even though they looked different, had different beliefs and culture, and I am not the only one, most people that went to the same type of schools that I did, ended up having the same world view. Such that Politicians who use tribalism to get votes had a hard time getting votes from us. \n\nThis is however not the case for all people in my country, lots of people went to school in less diverse places and these people are duped by politicians a lot in to voting against their own interest.\n\nNow back to the west, let's take the US for example some white voters vote for Republicans even though they would be better served by democrats e.g in terms of minimum wage, greater access to health care benefits and good working conditions all because of race based issues.",

  "selftext": "**Background about me**\n\nJust background on myself incase anyone wants to try no true Scotsman on my or anything like that.\n\nI'm approaching 40. Have kids who share my love of games. First console was an NES when I was 5, I've always had a console since. Today I have a gaming PC, a Steam Deck, and a Nintendo Switch.\n\nLately I have been playing Overwatch, Pokemon, New Zelda, Dragon Quest, and I've been digging into a lot of old JRPG's (pixel remasters, Dragon Quest, Super Mario RPG Remake, etc). I've been heavily into WoW in the past (like, into months of playtime), played dozens of JRPGs, remember N64 Mario Party and wrestling games, etc. I think I fit into the category of \"Gamer\" pretty darn well. Always down to play the latest streamer games with friends too (Lethal Company, Among Us, Phasmophobia, Fall Guys, etc).\n\n**The Problem**\n\nI want to start by saying I am not at all saying I love all modern changes in the gaming market. I also know people are allowed to complain.\n\nBut what I have found on reddit, in comment threads on all gaming news articles, inside gaming media itself, and among my friends is a crippling, debilitating, bitter, depressing RAGE.\n\nNothing is good enough. No company is good enough. Everything you are excited about must cater EXCLUSIVLEY to you in exactly the way you wish, or it is Satan's Spawn and f you for enjoying it.\n\nScarlet and Violet come out and don't have AAA graphics. OK? Don't buy it. Do I need friends who haven't played it shitting on me when I am excited about a new mon? Does the subreddit need to be brigaded with people who don't own the game and just want to shit talk it?\n\nCP2077 comes out and I have fun, no bugs, and they offer extended refunds to anyone who does. I'll sound like a broken record, but \\*don't play it if you don't like it\\*. Why do people need to act like the game personally knee capped their grandma?\n\nOverwatch goes FTP and ups skin prices a ton. It's shiny pixels, it's not pay to win. Don't give me crap about new heroes \"Sure, I can instantly play the heroes in a number of modes, and I can unlock for free, but what if I want to be in the meta, without playing the game at all, in competitive?\" What?? Don't buy the skins. Or stop playing the game. The only legit gripe here is that OW 1 disappeared. Funny enough, CS2 comes out and removes the only mode I ever played, Arms Race, and I get shit on because the Gamer Hive Mind decides that was a shitty game mode, so THAT is OK, but 6v6 going away in OW is again personally offensive to people.\n\nPeople converge on takes in this community, the edgier the better. You won't give $$ to companies that put out games that have bugs on platforms you don't use, but you'll give views and Patreon subs to people who bitch about games. Do gamers even like games, or is complaining about them #1 now?\n\nAnd, every time this happens, the publisher makes absolute bank. No one is crying because they went to reddit and people were mean (except, you know, underpaid devs who worked thousands of hours to bring you this just to get shit on). We're only hurting other gamers.\n\nThe only logical thing to do is vote with your wallet, and, IMHO, STFU. If Ford makes a new truck and it sucks, I won't buy it. I won't tell my friend he is a POS for buying it, then go onto Ford forums and say they are an evil company destroying my childhood. Why is disrupting fan communities, when you are not a fan, even a thing? Everyone would be happier and healthier playing what they love, being happy when their friends are happy, and living life. These are *games*.\n\n**TL;DR.** \n\nI think it comes down to this: The community is going to play/talk about X. You feel you need to play X to not be \"left out,\" But \"X\" has some issue. So you decide X owes you, personally, changes, so you can not be left out. Or, you choose to not be left out by actively hating on the game, so you are a \"part of\" the moment by being a hater. The result is a circlejerk of hate. Positive comments are met with \"WHY YOU DEFENDING A MULTIBILLION DOLLAR COMPANY\" or \"YOU BUYING THIS SHIT IS THE PROBLEM!!\" A \"community\" literally frothing at the mouth to insult its members. Who is having fun in these communities, exactly?\n\nBut, am I wrong? Are these people fighting the good fight and stopping bad practices? Are they snapping gamers who have entered the Matrix out of it?",

  "selftext": "Part of the problem of consumer debt is that payments towards a loan are applied to interest prior to the principal, which extends the loan life as it is more difficult to make progress on the interest generating portion of the loan. Further, the interest capitalizes into the principal which compounds the problem. \n\nIt doesn’t make sense that payments made towards the loan are applied to interest prior to principal, because the principal investment is what is used to generate the interest returns. One could not make the interest income without investing into some sort of asset in which the asset then generates the profit/value of the interest. \n\nIf interest is the combination of opportunity cost and risk, then once the principal amount is paid off, how is the initial loan offerer assuming risk? It ought to be the case that the value of the principal has already been recognized and cannot grow in value. The profit would still need to be paid off (interest) but it cannot grow further. Assets aside from land and human capital are subject to depreciation, so the model of a principal investment as an asset that cannot depreciate (but does carry risk in the form of default) is incorrect. \n\nThe strongest counter argument I can think of is that money is fungible and that one cannot differentiate between the dollar that generated the revenue and the one that was the initial investment. The consequence of this is that capitalization should occur instantly and not on a schedule.\n\nI’m sure there are other arguments against this and would love to hear them!

(Example of this: it is linguistically correct to take the Hebrew and the Greek phrase that is translated as “son of man” and instead translate it as “child of humanity.” That change alone takes out a bias that is anti-woman from JC’s words that was not there.) \n\nHate, fear, and anger are easy to weaponize, and these hateful preachers are using those weapons for their own benefits. \n\nPastorArrested is full of these kinds of fire and brimstone style preachers who are arrested and charged for child sexual abuse, and it is freaking disturbing to observe, predictably as the tides, that the faithful close ranks around the pastor that did such monstrous things to a child, though cult psychology easily explains why this happens. \n\nThing is, people don’t just fall into places that have hateful ideologies. Even those who grow up in such religious environments can, and often do, choose to leave that hatefulness behind. That seems to indicate it’s not the religion that makes one hate, but that one hates which directs to that religion. \n\nHate needs to build edifices of untruths, tortured logic, leaps of unreasoning to justify itself. So much work that one needs to put in to be hateful. \n\nTo not hate just requires seeing the other as one sees oneself. Super freaking lazy. \n\nBut I know I’m probably wrong in this, and I would like to see the other perspective since in any religion, there are always adherents who choose to not hate despite hateful messaging, and there are always adherents that choose to hate despite messaging that is free of hate. \n\nExample of the former would be the parishioners of the megachurch pastors claiming a certain orange man that lies, cheats, and steals as a good man who instead are Ridin’ with Biden, and an example of the latter are the Catholics that are upset at Pope Francis for giving a few millimetres to queer folks.",

Most of them can be defeated in under 5 seconds by a decent player. For example Morton/Roy who you can defeat before they reach the wall.\n\nThe level design: is repetitive: aside from the occasional unique theming (sawmill, forest of illusion, somewhat Choco land) feels largely the same.\nThere’s way too many water levels in the first half of the game (up to the forest of illusion) and being water levels they are miserable.\n\nLittle innovation: compared to Mario 3 this game doesn’t really innovate much. The only thing the game really added were secret exits, and the cape feather. It removed so much of what made 3 unique. It tones down the power ups until we’re left with just 5 (cape feather, fire flower, super mushroom, star, and the p-balloon) of which only 3 of them are used often enough to leave an impact. It also removed the card games, out of level items (hammer, anchor, warps, map encounters and the Powerup select)\n\nDid not take advantage of leap from Nes-Snes:  although this game could not have been played on the nes, with little downgrading it could have readily fit on that system. This is in comparison to sonic 1 which would have needed *massive* downgrading to work on the master system (yes I know a demake exists and it’s borderline unrecognizable). Mario world of downgraded would have likely been easily recognizable if downgraded due to it not taking advantage of the snes the same way Sonic 1 took advantage of the genesis \n\nFinally, the castle levels: this is more of a personal thing than anything but I’ve always found them absolutely miserable.

  "selftext": "We’re going based off the stereotypical zombie here. They’re slow, want brains and don’t have much of a consciousness. If you get bit, you turn into one.\nThat being said, I feel as though it may be earlier to survive one than people make it out to be. When pictured, people usually think of a post apocalyptic world but I think we could go about life pretty normally.\n\nFor starters, if this disease eats away at the host like it portrays in some media’s, it’s going to eventually get rid of their ability to see, hear, touch and even bite meaning they’re not really all that dangerous. Even if it doesn’t, and it only starts to infect the dead the real threat are really people who have recently passed away as their body has not been corroded yet, and likely still have full functionality. But I feel like this doesn’t make things all that harder because everyone would steer clear of the zombie once it first becomes infected, hence creating less infected and making it easier to contain. Again, the zombie is slow so you have plenty of time to react.\n\nSuppose there is a hoard anyways, they don’t have much of a consciousness and will probably just follow whatever noise they hear if that sense still remains. So we can just gather them up with a large radio or something. But if it doesn’t work as planned, then just stay inside. They probably won’t recall how to use a doorknob let alone have the strength to open it. So as long as the windows are fairly strong you should be fine. If this disease removes an individuals senses, why not the rest of them? Meaning all we have to do is wait it out from here. Of course, food is an issue, but assuming you are at home, in a grocery store or mall we could just ration it. If not, then growing micro greens whilst you wait for other bigger plants to grow could work due to how long we can go without food.\n\nAfter the majority of the zombies are either caught or decayed we can return to our normal life.

  "selftext": "The best way to figure out how smart someone is, is to gauge their perceived knowledge on a topic outside their expertise. Intelligent people will know they aren’t well educated in that subject, while unintelligent people will assume that they know all there is to know. Another example is that intelligent people will openly admit that they are not informed enough to have an opinion on a certain subject, while intelligent people will form an opinion with whatever knowledge the have, large or small. I think this is a way to separate “book smarts” from intelligence. You can have a PhD and know that outside your field, you truly don’t know that much about the world as a whole, and you can be a high school drop out and be aware of the fact that you may not know much about topics outside of your lifestyle. This can be applied to patients who believe they know more than their doctors, and doctors who believe they know more about living with a condition than their patient.

  "title": "CMV: in the clash between Patrick Stewart and James Corden at the Glamour awards, Patrick Stewart was definitely way more in the wrong",
  "selftext": "Let's dig up some ancient history that done and put away. The two below have already made up ages ago, but I wanna do the CMV anyways. \nIn 2010, Corden was hosting the Glamour Women of the Year awards. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIBUWqSTp90&t=42s\n\nPatrick Stewart for some reason was tearing into him. Starting off by accusing him of \"'looking around as if you would rather be anywhere in the world but here'.\"\n\nJames Corden I think handled this rather decently, where he defended himself, apologized if it seemed that way, and made a joke that allowed both of them to save face and move on. \n\nBut for some reason Patrick Stewart then gets super personal and cruel saying things like\n\n> 'From where I was, I could see your belly and that was from right at the back of the room.'\n\nWhich was not said in a joking way, and clearly Stewart's ego was hurt and he was lashing out \n\nThen afterwards Stewart says \n\n>\"Do you want one more? \"If you fancy one of the Jonas Brothers, cover your belly.\"\n\nSo on top of the nasty fat jokes, he tops it with a \"haha you're gay\" joke.\n\nSo in summary Patrick Stewart was rude for several reasons \n\n1. Interrupting an award show to criticize the host, who has an already difficult job. He may be in his own head because he is thinking about the other million things he has to do or be prepared for later in the show. Even if there is some feedback you want to give, give it after the show, don't publicly embarrass them \n2. Even after receiving an apology which as per point #1 think was overly generous, he still digs into him by making a nasty fat joke.\n3. After insulting Corden and fat people in general in the process he decides to insult Corden by implying he's gay, and by using \"being gay\" as an insult, thus insulting gay people in the process \n\nWhenever this topic comes up, people always tend to criticize Corden and easily forgive Stewart, even though on paper Corden didn't do anything wrong, and Stewart started the whole thing and wouldn't drop it. \n\nThe only reason this didn't keep escalating is because after the stupid Jonas brother gay fat joke, Corden held his tongue and became the better man by not retaliating. \n\nThe only thing I could think of that Corden did wrong was stand close to him at the podium and asking him where the punchline is. But I mean, he also has some self-respect, how many stupid, weak and nasty jokes and criticisms would you take before you start to stand up for yourself. And Corden didn't go nasty or so personal as Stewart did. All he did was criticize Stewart's actions. Stewart criticized him for his personal characteristics that is weight and joking about his sexual orientation.",

You will also pay. This doesn’t stop (in my experience) when you’re going steady either, that’s just how it is.\n\nThere are also many expectations for a man to court a women: Putting himself behind her always, being a shoulder to lean on while staying emotionally stoic, and hell, even dying for her if something terrible happens.\n\nThe man is expected to display his romance in creative and challenging ways. Asking a girl to prom or proposing in a way that is acceptable and not lame takes effort. If you just ask you’re not gonna get a yes.\n\nNow everyone has their job in this world and everyone has to work for what they want. That’s all fine and dandy.\n\nBut in contrast, to me it looks like women sit there and wait for a man to approach. Then on a date, she watches him to see if his behavior is good enough, without much regard to her own. She excepts gifts and favors without guilt, even expects them.\n\nThere are no expectations for her to do anything for a man except basic politeness (not that there should be any expectation). Women do not have to show much affection beyond intimacy. There are no grand displays or gestures they have to live up to (again, not that there should be any).\n\nWomen are judged much more on their appearance - I will concede that. I’m not convinced that alone is as much as the work guys need to put in though.\n\nBut like, obviously I’ve only lived my life as a dude. It’s is very possible I’m missing something and could be pretty biased. So I’d really like to hear the other side of it.\n\nAnd again please no sexist bullsh*t.

  "title": "CMV: Sleep is death.",
  "selftext": "My reasoning: This started when I was thinking about teleporters. There's some discussion that the classic sci-fi teleporter that disassembles someone's atoms and reassembles them somewhere else is actually unethical, since it functionally kills someone by disintegration and then clones them. This got me thinking about possible real life equivalents. For example, when someone goes under for surgery. Their brain is turned off by anesthetic, then some part of them is taken apart and put back together, then they wake up. To the patient, no time passed. Then I started thinking about other, more common causes for loss of consciousness, such as sleep. I thought of all of these things a long time ago, and I must have been in better mental health back then because I managed to dismiss the concept and continue my life as normal, but recently the theory has returned to my mind, probably after discussing teleporters with someone over discord. For the past few days I have woken up each morning with the suspicion that none of my memories are truly my own and that I have a 16 hour clock until oblivion. Obviously, I have lost a lot of sleep over this, which doesn't help with the anxiety.\n\nHere's a few arguments I have gathered myself already, as I am desperate to prove myself wrong. I consider most of these arguments to be sound enough, at least in combination, and I hope that they deter anyone who reads this post from falling victim to this veritable cognitohazard of a theory the way I have, however they have failed to beat my personal anxiety on the subject:\n\n1. It's completely unprovable, like those theories that the universe was created yesterday or that everything is a simulation. Thus there's no point in worrying about it. (Unlike the teleporter situation. If you disassemble someone's atoms they're obviously dead. Furthermore, if you have technology that can instantly assemble perfect copies of people anywhere within a certain range, why are you using it just to teleport them? Why destroy the original? Why not populate the cosmos with clones of Earth's greatest minds, or create organs for transplants or for use in testing to find a cure for cancer or something? Why not use the same concept with inanimate objects to aid in construction or to print food? That's getting off topic though.)\n\n2. The popular explanation for why we can't remember the moment that we go to sleep is simply because our brain doesn't store memories during that time. On top of that, there is brain activity during that stage of sleep. I think. I'm not a neuroscientist and I forgot where I read most of this.\n\n3. [This post on the Lucid Dreaming subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/xlnvrn/i_managed_to_stay_conscious_from_the_moment_i/) If this post and its comments can be trusted, it seems as if some people, with effort, have experienced and remembered the transition from being awake to sleeping that you normally forget, which would sort of prove that the stream of consciousness isn't cut off. (I say \"sort of prove\" since it's just anecdotal evidence, but it's not like there's many ways to get stronger evidence on this topic.) I know that it's possible to remember part of a dream or forget it entirely, so I'm not too skeptical of the idea of someone managing to remember the start of a dream.\n\nEdit: I have convinced myself at this point that sleep is not death. All it took was getting to a less sleep deprived state and mulling over my own arguments again. Sorry that I'm not giving a delta to every well thought out response.",

Content ranges from generic advertising, targeted advertising, donation begging, to actual scams. This signal:noise ratio is so poor that the average citizen's mailbox is barely worth checking anymore. \n\n\"Junk Mail\" is an Advertising Lobby whitewashing term. My attic has junk. \"Trash Mail\" accurately describes the daily process of opening mailbox, immediately trashing 75% of it, then reviewing and trashing the remaining 25%. Yes, usually 0% of mail is kept.\n\nRecently I've refused to waste time checking mail in favor of relatively controllable email. However letters still hold legal weight. Legal notices, city notifications, business notifications, old-school landlords, and more use mail. One day I'll probably miss something important and get in trouble. \n\n---\n\nThis is a broken unregulated system. [Modern people are drowning in notifications](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/health/teen-hundreds-of-phone-notifications-report-wellness/index.html). Letters specially should be a noteworthy event requiring careful reading of it's content. \"Gather around family we received a letter!\"-level noteworthy. Modern day email, phone call, text, or push notifications must be included. This goal is only attainable if each communication is important. \n\nAny non-person-to-person communication (business, political, government) over any medium needs opt-in regulations \n\n* Zero communication allowed without opt-in - Advertising, car warranty scams, coupons, and other litter\n* Opt-in default minimum communication - For example bills, critical service announcements, or appointments. No extraneous newsletters, coupons, or non-critical notifications are allowed\n* Opt-in greater than once per week/month communication - To control otherwise functional companies doing \"maximum-minimum\" abuse for daily spam, throttle their ability to once a week or month. \n* Opt-in unlimited communication - How it is today\n* USPS managed opt-out forms. Citizens need an easy method to change their option. USPS or private company could have 3 field website for consumers that notifies businesses for you as a legal notice. Businesses cannot be trusted to make an easy opt-out process, eg see canceling gym memberships. \n\nThe fundamental laws that founded USPS and unregulated business communication 200+ years ago didn't expect billions of advertising letters sent far and wide for pennies, robots printing truckloads of mail at a time, nor digital communications. Modern problems require modern solutions. \n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Opt-out instead**\n\nFundamentally nobody should have to opt-out of receiving trash. Lawmakers agreed by creating anti-trash-dumping laws. Distributing trash in city mailboxes should not be exempt.\n\nIndustry site https://www.dmachoice.org are pay to opt out and themselves estimate 80% effective. Serial renters must re-opt-out every move + deal with the previous tenant's opt-in trash. \n\nChanging businesses, or \"voting with your wallet\", just because of trash mail is inconvenient to unreasonable like your electric company, closest hospital, bank, or other important services. \n\n**First amendment concerns**\n\nThe first amendment provides a right to speak but not to be heard. \nHere the citizen is controlling communication. The government is merely enforcing the citizen's decisions, not making decisions themselves.\n\n**Advertising and Coupons benefits businesses** \n\nGreat! Advertise the benefits inside participating businesses. Such a valuable service will sell itself with stacks of opt-in forms. Just like every other industry. \n\n**USPS survives off of trash mail**\n\nConsider the environment's resources consumed every year to manufacture the letter, transport between manufacturers then to USPS, delivery to your mailbox, consumer evaluates for 0.2 seconds, then transport to recycle center or likely city dump. Doing this as effectively a make-work jobs program is a poor excuse.\n\nOther countries may have solved this problem. Other revenue sources exist. \"Last mile\" delivery is becoming competitive. Trash mail is not the only solution. \n\n**Businesses will switch to email and apps to avoid regulation**\n\nThis CMV focuses on USPS letter mail. \n\nAs mentioned above this regulation should extend to electronic communications which is also [drowning in notifications](https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/health/teen-hundreds-of-phone-notifications-report-wellness/index.html). \"Communication\" must be broadly defined enough to adapt to new methods without an act of congress every time. \nThis isn't unprecedented.

If you argue that women are as smart as men, they shouldn't need a quota system to get into these colleges. \n\nThe govt nowhas a rule that each engineering stream/branch should have at least 20% women. This will ensure at least 20% of overall students are women. This is BS too since when I see the scores in University examinations, women are overwhelmingly performing less than men when it comes to marks scored. So what's the point of enabling people who clearly can't do well in the competition, or even meet the averages, to get the same degree? Professors also pass these women somehow since they will be otherwise called discriminatory. It only dilutes the quality of graduates from that institution. \n\nFinally, there is a trend in my company where a set of people are complaining women aren't 50% of leadership positions. If you're inlet is skewed, why shouldn't leadership positions be? We have lesser female engineers. What's then the logic behind asking for 50% females in leadership positions? Not only does this undermine the actual achievers, it also makes leadership worse. It's really hard to work under someone who is way out of their depth or competence. Creates problems for everyone under them. But it's a huge taboo to say that ones female boss is an idiot - even though I can say that comfortably about my male bosses. \n\n\nI am all for solving these problems at their root cause. If women are faring worse in engineering competitives, I'm all for programs that encourage women and develop their competence in problem solving, math, physics, chemistry, spatial intelligence and verbal and non verbal reasoning.

Israel gave back the entirety of the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in exchange for peace, a wildly controversial and unpopular move at the time. \n\nWhen Israel left Gaza in 2005, it forcibly removed Israeli citizens to let Gazans govern themselves.\n\n When the goal is great (peace, or statehood), hard and tough decisions must be made.

Like it or not, for peace to exist, when one party starts a war and then loses, they lose leverage and negotiating power and must make compromises if peace is truly the goal.

What other country would allow another entity to break through, murder over 1000 civillians, and then take back over 150 hostages?

  "selftext": "I disagree with many people across the political spectrum. I disagree with conservatives on a great deal of issues, I disagree with the way progressives approach certain issues. But I also believe that, in most cases, the overall intentions of those two groups are good and Im sure they're completely right about certain things and I'm completely wrong and I don't even know it. \n\nBut there are two groups that I do not feel this way about. First, white supremacists and Neo Nazis. Not only are white supremacists and Neo nazis fine with POC dying- including friends and loved ones who are POC- white supremacists and Neo Nazis  are fine with white people dying too if they are \"race traitors\" (aka if they're not white supremacists.) I am sure Neo Nazis and white supremacists are not only wrong, but a huge threat to humanity and the world. I'm not looking to change my view on that. \n\nThe second group : Marxists and Communists. In conversations with Marxists or communists I've always had a hard time overlooking the fact that a huge number of innocent people would have to suffer and die for the kind of society they want to exist. \n\nAnd Marxists and communists will counter with \"but a huge number of people are suffering now,\" But the most vulnerable people who are suffering now will also be the most vulnerable if society is destroyed entirely. Almost nobody alive today will benefit. \n\nFuture generations would only benefit if Marxists are actually able to build a better society than the one we have now. And this, to me, is another huge problem with Marxism and communism- there's no proof of concept. there's no proof that a society like that could ever work or would be compatible with humanity. And depending on the level of improvement, Democracy may get us to the same level or even further without so much bloodshed. On top of all of that, even if it could work and it wasn't incompatible with humanity, there's also a very high chance of ending up with a society where more people suffer if this one is destroyed. \n\nSo, taking all of that into consideration, Marxists and communists are OK with innocent people alive today suffering and dying- including the most vulnerable and loved ones and friends- if it means we *might* end up with something like a Marxist or communist Utopia that would help the next generation,  assuming it's not incompatible with the post agriculture human race to begin with. I don't see how I could possibly respect that. I can just imagine a Marxist looking down at me as I'm dying in the street after somebody stabs me and coldly repeating the no true Scotsman fallacy. \n\nI have encountered \"quiet\" Marxists/communists who say this would only be a thing if people wanted it to be and that the majority of people would have to decide one day to take this route. Which is a less worrisome attitude to me,  but if they're trying to sell Marxism/communism to people so that day will eventually come, I still can't respect them. So it seems to me like the only way I could respect Marxists and communists is if I have no way of knowing they are Marxist/communist and they aren't deserving of respect in the first place due to their heinous dangerous views. \n\nBut I'm open to changing my view!",

Most guys actually dream they could get to the sort of numbers attractive women get and because they can't, they get resentful and lash out. It's all a veneer or rationality and argument, used to rationalise strong emotions.\n\nBUT HERE'S THE IMPORTANT PART: It's totally fine to feel that way. I'm not judging anyone.

For those unaware because of the current conflict in Gaza, the West Bank is currently under a (textbook) fascist Israeli occupation. This is implied because of Israeli's settlement expansions. In 1983, the settler population in the West Bank was 22,000. Last year, that number was estimated to be as high as 500,000, despite Israel agreeing with Palestine in 1996's Oslo Accords to not remove any settlements as long as expansions end.\n\n2. Those settlements are built on top of destroyed, evicted or ethnically cleansed Palestinian lands. They were considered illegal by every country from 1967 until 2019 when Donald Trump declared support for them.\n\n3. The \"International Community\" votes every year to condemn those settlements. This includes Europe, France, Germany, Ukraine, India, so on. The US and Canada were the only countries apart from a few small former Oceanasian/US colonies to not condemn them.\n\n4. The settlements destroy Palestinian lives, property including farms and businesses, control Palestinian consumption (85% of the West Bank's GDP comes from Settlements- that money only goes to Israel), and every year hundreds of Palestinians get evicted for those settlements.\n\n5. Hamas has no operations in the West Bank, that much is clear. Yet 350 Palestinians have died in that area since the start of the war 2 months ago. There are walls and security checkpoints separating the West Bank's settlements and many parts of the West Bank and all of them make a 5 minute walk take up to 30 minutes in security clearances and checkings. However, Israeli passports are free to navigate past these checkpoints as needed.",

  "selftext": "It is commonly agreed that denying a child food or medical care constitutes child abuse, because of the adverse impacts on the child's health, physical and emotional development, and wellbeing. We have reached this conclusion based on numerous long term research studies that have demonstrated the adverse impacts of these practices. Drinking while pregnant with your child is similarly considered a form of child abuse, because of its negative effects on child development.\n\nHowever, despite decades of scientific research and an overwhelming body of evidence indicating that spanking or corporal punishment in children creates a host of adverse effects on the child, we still accept that parents have the right to punish their children in this manner.\n\n**What does the research say?**\n\n* A landmark meta-analysis published in 2002 showed that **of** **27 studies on physical punishment and child aggression,** **all found a significant positive relation,** regardless of the size of the sample, location of study, ages of the children or any other variable. (Gershoff ET. Corporal punishment by parents and associated child behaviors and experiences: a meta-analytic and theoretical review. Psychol Bull 2002;128:539–79)\n* Physical punishment is **associated with a range of mental health problems in children, youth and adults, including depression, unhappiness, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, use of drugs and alcohol,** and general psychological maladjustment. (Turner HA, Muller PA. Long-term effects of child corporal punishment on depressive symptoms in young adults: potential moderators and mediators. J Fam Issues 2004;25:761–82)\n* Intriguing results are now emerging from neuroimaging studies, which suggest that **physical punishment may reduce the volume of the brain’s grey matter** in areas associated with performance on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, third edition (WAIS-III). (Tomoda A, Suzuki H, Rabi K, et al. Reduced prefrontal cortical gray matter volume in young adults exposed to harsh corporal punishment. Neuroimage 2009;47:T66–71)\n* Physical punishment can cause **alterations in the dopaminergic regions associated with vulnerability to the abuse of drugs and alcohol.** (Sheu Y-S, Polcan A, Anderson CM, et al. Harsh corporal punishment is associated with increased T2 relaxation time in dopamine-rich regions. Neuroimage 2010;53:412–9)\n* Researchers are also finding that **physical punishment is linked to slower cognitive development and adversely affects academic achievement.** (Straus MA, Paschall MJ. Corporal punishment by mothers and development of children’s cognitive ability: a longitudinal study of two nationally representative age cohorts. J Aggress Maltreat Trauma 2000;18:459–83)\n\nSimilarly, research has demonstrated that there is a high correlation between spanking and serious physical abuse.  A large Canadian study found that *children who were spanked by their parents were seven times more likely to be severely assaulted by their parents* (e.g., punched or kicked) than children who were not spanked. In an American study, *infants in their first year of life who had been spanked by their parents in the previous month were 2.3 times more likely to suffer an injury requiring medical attention* than infants who had not been spanked. (Crandall M, Chiu B, Sheehan K. Injury in the first year of life: risk factors and solutions for high-risk families. J Surg Res 2006; 133:7–10)\n\nThis indicates to me that allowing corporal punishment opens the door for other forms of more severe physical violence.\n\n**To me it's simple: parents have no right to permanently damage their child's brain, whether that's drinking while pregnant or hitting it after it's born. Any action which permanently harms a child's brain development is a form of child abuse that requires intervention. And anyone who spanks their child is a bad parent.** ",

I also recently saw a JRE episode with a neuro-scientist, and she goes deep into how AI bots are going to completely revamp human-AI interactions.\n\nAssuming everything goes according to plan, it’s almost certain that human-AI marriages are going to become a thing, and to be honest I think that it’s going to have an overall net-positive effect on society, helping loneliness, and other similar silent epidemics.  \nLinks:   \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJH90hziZS4 (JRE clip)  \nhttps://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/04/robots-human-relationships/583204/  \nhttps://theconversation.com/i-tried-the-replika-ai-companion-and-can-see-why-users-are-falling-hard-the-app-raises-serious-ethical-questions-200257  \nhttps://a16z.com/its-not-a-computer-its-a-companion/  \nhttps://theconversation.com/sex-love-and-companionship-with-ai-why-human-machine-relationships-could-go-mainstream-201856  \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/03/technology/personaltech/ai-chatbot-pi-emotional-support.html  \nhttps://www.theguardian.com/careers/2020/may/07/ai-and-me-friendship-chatbots-are-on-the-rise-but-is-there-a-gendered-design-flaw  \nhttps://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/your-ai-companion-will-support-you-no-matter-what  \nhttps://hospitalitytech.com/37-gen-z-say-tech-has-weakened-their-people-skills  \nhttps://fortune.com/2023/10/06/gen-z-biggest-skills-gap-social-anxiety-work-managing-ambiguity-michelle-king/  \n",

  "title": "CMV: Marriage isn't worth it for a modern man at all",
  "selftext": "Before anyone goes on and saying how this is usual and you are just 22, this is a compilation of my personal experience. I am not saying you should go divorce your wife either. Just need someone to talk me into or out of marriage. \n\nI have watched a total of 4 marriages fail, and all resulted in the man getting absolutely shafted, even with a prenup. One was my uncle, his ex wife put a false domestic violence claim on him and it was proven that he never did it, but still spent 2 days in county holding. Second was my cousin, who married someone making around his income, but she still walked away with the house, car, and most of the properties. Third was my friend (27M) who got cheated on during his deployment, and she walked away with half his income as spousal support (thank god they didn't have children). Fourth was my other army friend, and he got cheated on during his time in the hospital as he was recovering from a partial hip replacement. \n\nStatistically speaking, 50% of marriages fail. Would you fly on a plane with a 50% chance of crashing? With women initiating 70% divorces, why take a risk? \n\nBut married men live longer. Why live longer in suffering than a shorter happier life? Why should I have to ask my future wife if I want to buy a motorcycle with my money after contributing to the bills? Why should I have a man cave in the house I paid for? \n\nBut married men are happier. Only for the first two years, after that it diminishes. ([https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier](https://ifstudies.org/blog/does-getting-married-really-make-you-happier))\n\nOn reddit and other sites have proven time and time again that men should overlook their feelings when a child or family is involved. Even to go as far as accept children born from affairs years after finding out years after. Even to go as far as demonizing men for requesting paternity and other genetic tests to confirm it is in fact their child. Or when men don't want to be a father, and even while paying child support, being called a deadbeat. \n\nOver and over again everything that goes wrong in a marriage is automatically the man's fault. Man cheats because his wife doesn't want any intimacy, he is the devil incarnate. Woman cheats because her man doesn't provide the intimacy, it is his fault automatically for not providing for her. Man want's his wife to be a stay at home parent, he is controlling. He wants his wife to work, he is broke. \n\nEven asking for a prenuptial agreement is seen as a asshole move nowadays. \n\nI am not an incel, I have no issues with women. But until the institution of marriage changes to provide TRUE benefit to men, please tell me some good reasons to get married in the 21st century as a man. The simple cost-benefit analysis shows that you lose more than gain. ",

  "selftext": "For the average guy, finding a girl you really like is getting increasingly challenging. Instead of connecting people like they were supposed to, dating apps have instead created a hookup culture, which there's absolutely nothing wrong with, but this culture is def not conducive to long-term relationships.\n\nAlso, especially in a tier-1 cities as an average guy, dating is getting really really expensive. Going out to even a decent restaurants is something many are barely able to afford. As a young male, being in a relationship in your early 20s is basically an evolutionary ‘need’. We haven’t adapted to this new social hookup culture, or just being lonely.\n\nA quick Google search will show that sexlessness and being single is the highest it's ever been, for both men and women.Most guys I know are single and don’t have a girlfriend. Some of them are turning to replikas or some other form of technology to make up for their loneliness. If this continues, men are going to latch on to the next best thing- AI companions. They will be accessible to everyone, fulfil our emotional and maybe even sexual needs, and will even be a lot cheaper than actually dating a girl.\n\nPS: I would like to add that 20 years is a very long time from now.

  "title": "CMV: Polygamy marriages should be legal in the United States",
  "selftext": "Polygamy marriages should be legal in the United States and the US government should allow polygamy marriages to be done legally. I’m using US laws, constitution, culture, religions, beliefs, history, etc, to come to my reasons and conclusions. I also ask questions but that’s my way to express what I believe.\n\nThe United States government doesn’t have a history of legislating marriage that much, but at same time, it kind of does. Even if it was very bare minimum, black and white sometimes. I believe the US constitution supports polygamy, a man or woman having multiple spouses, like it already supports a marriage between one man and one woman, by whatever age, religion, skin color, wealth, nationality, etc. Of course same gender or sex as well. And here’s the part I’ll mention, the US government allows you to legally marry regardless if you actually love the person or not. US government hardly legislated that, but they have legislated marriage (historically or not) by age, skin color, gender/sex, and I believe by family, as in I can’t marry a close blood relative, and of course how many people I can actually marry, which I’m arguing for. They also legislated sexual activity, tax law, welfare, healthcare, crime, etc in regards to legal marriage as well. \n\nCommon law is something the US government and states established as the law of the land, from California to Maine. Each state has different marriage law history, but in 2024, we all ended up very similar, but that’s just US government legislating the country. Core tenants or the bare minimum of marriage is one adult and one adult, with one US citizen being involved, but why not more than two adults? \n\nWhy can’t I, have two wives for example? American politicians and lawmakers have always argued the United States is the land of freedom, and to quote one of the first legal documents of US civilization, \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\". My happiness is connected to marriage, and I want to achieve the American dream with my wives. Owning a house for example, having kids, doing what any other American couples do, but just with one more person that’s legally recognized. \n\nPolygamy marriages is bare minimum of American marriage, because it will work no different to how monogamy marriages work. In marriages we love, we hate, we have kids, we have successes, we have failures, we divorce or separate, we become rich, we abuse, we die and leave our spouses behind what we owned, etc. I can have multiple kids, so why can’t I have multiple marriages partners at the same time? \n\nThe US government doesn’t tell me I need to love my one wife, or live with her. I can cheat on her, neglect her, divorce her, etc. All legal, but if I just want to marry one more person, that’s not legal? \n\nI pay taxes to the US government, my wife pays taxes to the US government, why can’t I add one more person to my government recognized marriage? \n\nSo this is what I believe, and I believe polygamy is American and should be allowed in the United States, change my mind?",

  "title": "CMV: Gun control is good",
  "selftext": "As of now, I believe that the general populace shouldn’t have anything beyond a pistol, but that even a pistol should require serious safety checks. I have this opinion because I live in America with a pro-gun control family, and us seeing all these mass shootings has really fueled the flame for us being anti-gun. But recently, I’ve been looking into revolutionary Socialist politics, and it occurred to me: how could we have a Socialist revolution without some kind of militia? This logic, the logic of revolting against an oppressive government, has been presented to me before, but I always dismissed it, saying that mass shootings and gun violence is more of an issue, and that if we had a good government, we wouldn’t need to worry about having guns. I still do harbor these views to an extent, but part of me really wants to fully understand the pro-gun control position, as it seems like most people I see on Reddit are for having guns, left and right politically. And of course, there’s also the argument that if people broke into your house with an illegally obtained gun, you wouldn’t be able to defend yourself in a society where guns are outlawed; my counter to that is that it’s far more dangerous for society as a whole for everyone to be walking around with guns that it is for a few criminal minds to have them. Also, it just doesn’t seem fair to normalize knowing how to use a highly complex piece of military equipment, and to be honest, guns being integrated into everyone’s way of life feels just as dystopian as a corrupt government. So what do you guys have to say about this? To sum, I am anti-gun but am open to learning about pro-gun viewpoints to potentially change my view.",

  "title": "CMV: It is hypocritical for a socialist to not take steps to minimize their personal consumption",
  "selftext": "My understanding of Socialism is that it effectively hinges on the theory that the richer you get each incremental dollar becomes less valuable and therefore wealthy people should be forced to pay significantly higher taxes than the current rates.\n\nDue to this one would assume that a socialist would attempt to evaluate how much they need to spend to be comfortable and then either forward the rest to their countries tax authority or most likely donate it to a charity that helps the less fortunate.\n\nObviously the amount needed to be comfortable is somewhat subjective but in my view many socialists go above and beyond what could be considered reasonable expenses. To give some examples Jagmeet Singh of Canada's NDP Democratic socialist party has been spotted using a Versace tote bag that retailed for $1000+ and also owns at least one Rolex. He also drives a Mercedes. These three items are luxury goods and much of their appeal comes from the fact that others see them and know how expensive they are. To me the fact that one is spending money on items that are primarily intended to demonstrate ones wealth would indicate that they have more than enough money to cover the necessities. Under a socialist ideology the money spent on the luxury goods should have been given to charity. He could have purchased a grocery store tote bag, a Seiko and a Toyota Corolla and he would still be able to do most of the same things the other items would have enabled him to do while forwarding the tens of thousands in savings to a charitable cause of his choice. All of this likely would rightfully help his electoral performance.\n\nAdditionally, another Socialist theory is the Labour theory of value which states than when a good is sold and a company makes a profit that profit should belong to the workers who made the product. This should also incentive socialists to consume less as the more they consume the more money wrongfully goes into the hands of the \"thieves\" who own the companies. If the money is diverted to charity then money will be taken away from the ownership class and allocated to the neediest members of society.\n\n\nObviously a degree of spending is necessary for a socialist to engage in. I don't see any issue with food, a small residence, nice enough clothing to avoid looking like a slob, modest vacations, a cell phone, a laptop or a TV being bought. People need some level of entertainment and treating yourself is necessary to retain the motivation to work. \n\n\nThe best argument a socialist could  make against donating excess income to charity is that the lower classes need to feel more pain in order to provoke political change which will eventually result in a more equal society. This argument fails to hold water as the money could be sent abroad to provide aid in a country that is already sufficiently socialist. Alternatively the money could be sent to a country that currently doesn't have an effective government and that is currently suffering from famine like Yemen. Both of these options would send money to people in greater need while avoiding inadvertently propping up capitalism.",

  "title": "CMV: There's nothing wrong with being a 'Passport Bro'",
  "selftext": "As a lonely man, I understand wanting love and connection- emotional, mental, spiritual, and physical. I've been hearing the term passport bro recently, generally used in a negative way, and after reading more about it I don't understand the hate. I think it's amazing that some men are taking a huge risk traveling across the world to find love and connection in an effort to cure their loneliness. \n\nA couple things I've heard people (mostly women) say as to why passport bros are bad:\n\n-they're looking for sex, not love. \n\nI'm not sure how anybody would know this and many men do get into relationships with foreign women. And even if they are just looking for sex, I don't think there's anything wrong with looking for consensual sex in other countries. And if they lie and claim they're a billionaire in their home country and a woman in another country sleeps with them because of that, that's just two users using each other. Neither had noble intentions. \n\n-These men are interested in these women because they think they'll be more submissive\n\nSome men want a submissive woman some women want a dominant man and vice versa. Submissive # abused and Dominant # abuser. This dynamic is seen all the time in American relationships. Dominant women with submissive men. Dominant men with submissive women. \n\nIf a man travels overseas to rape a woman of course that's evil and sick, but that has nothing to do with being a passport bro. Remove the passport bro part and they're still evil. \n\nIt just seems like people are beating down on men who are already down on their luck and are trying to do something to take control of their lives. Personally, I'm not even sure how many of these men succeed and if they do it might be because they're more confident in that environment and more able to be themselves and engage with the world. And foreign women are perfectly capable of saying \"No\" and men need to respect that. But if a lonely man finds love overseas or even has consensual sex overseas in my view that's not a problem. \n\nBut feel free to change it!\n\nUpdate: I think it's time to update my view\n\nSome people here have said I misunderstood what a passport bro was. Originally I thought I did, but then I did some research to find an agreed upon definition and there is none. Mine appears to be as valid as anyone else's unless someone can point to an official source. \n\nI acknowledge that there are toxic passport bros, but I thought so when I first posted so that doesn't really change my view. \n\nI acknowledge that my ideas about foreign women \"gold digging\" were simplistic and unfair given how many don't have the basic things they need to survive and also taking into account that parents pressure their daughters to marry successful men. \n\nI don't think anyone should lie about their wealth, but nor do I think lying about one's wealth to someone you want to have sex with and having sex with them is \"rape.\" \n\nBased on the passport bros subreddit that somebody linked, there are a variety of reasons why men may decide to seek love in a foreign country. \n\nSo mostly, with a couple of shifts, my view is still the same. But I appreciate all the great conversation and everybody's thoughts on this topic. I also found out that the term is a bit older than I thought. ",

  "title": "CMV: The Ukraine war shows that the much-hated military-industrial complex is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have.",
  "selftext": "Few industries are despised more in the West than the military industry. Prior to the Ukraine war, progressive politicians (and some conservatives as well) constantly railed against defense spending, arguing that that money could have gone towards \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ *(insert your priority of choice: schools, healthcare, environmentalism, energy, social causes, welfare, etc.)* instead.\n\nWestern European nations, by and large, spent little on defense (despite a NATO pledge for each member to spend at least 2% of their GDP on defense). When you asked liberal voters what government item budget they wanted the most to see big cuts for, they would invariably say \"the military.\"\n\nBut the Ukraine war suddenly changed the tune of many such folks. The same folks who decried the billions of dollars spent on weaponry production (\"guns vs. butter\") suddenly now fret about whether the U.S. is able to manufacture enough artillery shells in time to give to Ukraine. The same people who thought of the U.S. defense industry as a useless pit for taxpayer dollars to be wasted now complain that we're not sending enough Abrams tanks, ATACMS, Javelins, Stingers or F-16s to Ukraine. The Daily Kos, a very left-leaning publication, has suddenly featured numerous pro-Ukraine articles detailing the need for U.S. military support of Ukraine and the amount of such. The Democratic Party - previously, the party typically calling for defense budget cuts - has been the *more* hawkish party on the Ukraine issue. Numerous (although not all) leftists/progressives have shifted from anti-war to pro-war.\n\nAnd not to take anything away from the courage and ingenuity of the Ukrainians, who have fought more bravely and cleverly than perhaps any nation we've seen in decades, but it can clearly be seen that if it weren't for the massive amount of Western military assistance that had been given, Ukraine would have been overrun long since by now. Such aid would not have been possible without a substantial military-industrial complex in the West.\n\nYou can't obtain these things on short notice. Modern weapons systems are typically highly complex and require thousands of components, along with much slowly-accumulated expertise and years of development. If the West had neglected defense-manufacturing and a war like the Ukraine conflict had broken out (or Russia invaded NATO, or whatnot), it would have been impossible to spool up in time. This isn't WW2, when weapons were comparatively simple and crude.\n\nSpeaking of World War II.....the American military-industrial complex is the main reason the Allies were able to win that war. At one point, Ford was churning a new B-24 bomber off the production lines every hour. No American MIC = a very different war outcome.\n\nAll of this shows is that the military manufacturing of the West - particularly the United States' - is in fact a very good and necessary thing to have. The function of weapons factories is similar to that of a fire department - it's not something you **want** to have to use, but you need it to be there for emergencies. (Assuming, of course, your military is used for defense, not offense. I want Russia and North Korea to have as little MIC as possible.) Furthermore, as a percentage of the federal budget, the military actually accounts for substantially less of the budget than it did in the Cold War, and is relatively modest compared to the amount spent on Medicare, Social Security, etc.\n\nOf course, there are major issues with over-pricing, waste and conflict-of-interest in the U.S. defense industry (there's no excuse for F-35 development and production to have been the SNAFU that it was,) and major reform and cost-accountability is needed. Nobody is saying waste is good. But the Ukraine war has shown that a robust defense industry is something people like to hate in peacetime, but learn to grasp the value of in wartime.\n\n&#x200B;",

She then proceeds to be all \"Surprised Pikachu-faced\" when he thinks she cheated on him with said coworker, refuses to help with the baby, and him and his family start treating her badly.

Surely it wouldn't be too hard to add a simple paternity test to the list!\n* I know there's an implication of mistrust that comes with asking your partner for a paternity test, but if it became standard procedure - in other words, a test that the hospital does \"automatically\", with no need for parental input - that would completely remove that implication from play. It would become a non-issue.\n* Having a kid is a life-changing event, and it scares me to no end to know that I could be forced into \"one-eightying\" my life over a baby I actually played no part in making.\n* Knowing your family's medical history, from both sides, is extremely important. \"Mommy's little secret\" could cost her child dearly later on in life.",

  "selftext": "This is possibly the least persuasive argument I've made, in my efforts to get people to think about racism in a different way.  The point being that we've reduced \"conscious racism\" dramatically since 1960, and yet the marriage rate, between white guys and black women, is almost exactly where it was in 1960.  I would say that shows two things:  1) racism is a huge part of our lives today, and 2) racism (real racism) isn't conscious, but subconscious.  Reducing \"conscious racism\" hasn't reduced real racism.  And so \"conscious racism\" isn't racism, but just the APPEARANCE of racism.\n\nAs I say, no one seems to be buying it, and the problem for me is, I can't figure out why.  Sure, people's lives are better because we've reduced \"conscious racism.\"  Sure, doing so has saved lives.  But that doesn't make it real racism.  If that marriage rate had risen, at the same time all these other wonderful changes took place, I would agree that it might be.  But it CAN'T be.  Because that marriage rate hasn't budged.  \"Conscious racism\" is nothing but our fantasies about what our subconsciouses are doing.  And our subconsciouses do not speak to us.  They don't write us letters, telling us what's really going on.\n\nWhat am I saying, that doesn't make sense?  It looks perfectly sensible to me.",

  "title": "CMV: Leaving a relationship which has minor children involved for the reason, \"I'm just not happy\" is not a valid moral reason for leaving a relationship/divorce.",
  "selftext": "EDIT: if this changes your perception of me, I don't plan on ever getting married or having kids, in part because I value myself over the \"water\" kids bring to my port and the risk involved if marriages go south and the harm such would cause to potential children with the current divorce rate being what it is. At least I'm consistent. I don't think its a good deal for me, so I don't make the deal, which has been my appeal throughout! I'm also not religious, just for context. \n\nFor clarity: In abuse, certainly valid moral reason to leave. I could see cheating which is persistent and pernicious to also be a valid reason. I can see various other reasons like criminal behavior, drug abuse, refusing to work and pull one's weight, child neglect, etc. also being more than valid. Additionally, due to reduced harms, after the kids are 18 the \"I'm just not happy\" reason is allowed. **Again, it's only when you are in a relationship with kids under the roof.**\n\nHowever, simply because one \"isn't happy\" or one doesn't have the \"excitement\" or other such personal pleasure reasons is not a valid moral reason to break up a relationship with children involved.\n\nReasons:\n\n1) Single parent households lead to dramatically worse outcomes (on average) for the children. In terms on future income, in terms of crime rates, in terms of mental/emotional troubles, etc. Your own happiness is clearly counter-balanced by the negative impacts on the children. The children count for just as much as you. Is your momentary happiness worth more than the life-time of impacts such would have on the children? I think not. When you have a kid you have a duty to do the best for them, not a duty to do best for you!\n\n2) Represents a re-neg on one's commitment for the relationship. One can't re-write the terms of a bargain simply because one isn't happy. Does this mean that a couple shouldn't work out its problems, of course not, however, breaking up a relationship simply out of a lack of personal pleasure was never the deal that marriage or long-term relationships propose (we even say in vows, \"for better or worse\"). Rather, such is a deal based around duty and providing children a starting point for their future life.\n\n3) One's happiness is one's own responsibility. Making one's partner the external source for one's own happiness isn't fair to the partner.\n\n4) Breaking up relationships for personal happiness reasons encourages and validates long-term relationships (with children) and Marriages being transitory and erodes their meaning. It devalues commitment and trust, because at any moment if partner isn't happy it becomes morally acceptable to break up the family, harm the kids, harm the financial situation, etc. Therefore, eliminating mere personal happiness from the equation strengthens the meaning of commitment and encourages families to work out their problems and encourages deeper thinking before making long-term commitments in relationships. It also sets example for kids that if one does want to have kids with someone they had better work on that relationship and think deeply, as they simply can't re-neg if they \"don't like it\" 7 years down the line. \n\n5) Validating leaving for simple happiness sends bad messages to society and children about relationships. It forces one into a self-centered hedonistic view of relationships where only the individual counts and not the other people who are impacted in the relationship.\n\n6) Increases financial family stability as well as financial opportunity for children. It also increases the amount of time parents can spend with their children due to being a two income household as opposed to a single parent one. \n\n7) Gives children safety and security and trust that mom and dad will both be there after school. \n\n8) Allows for same gender role-models to be there at all times for the children. Which is also important.\n\nDelta will be given if one can produce a reason for someone to break up a relationship simply out of personal pleasure that does NOT involve:\nAbuse, child neglect, criminal behavior, drug abuse, negative financial situations (ex. scum-bag don't want to work and sits home all day and does nothing... which would probably be financial abuse!), cheating, etc...\n\nAgain, for me to change my mind here I need clear argument for why my personal pleasure or dissatisfaction alone is enough to break up a relationship with children involved.",

This displaced the Palestinian people and while some do integrate into current Israel, a large number are in Palestine and over several years Israel has treated them badly and displaced them from their homes.\n\nA few months ago Hamas, which my understanding is a terrorist group but is also supported and elected by the majority of Palestinians, launched a cowardly terrorist attack that killed many innocent people.\n\nIn response, Israel has acted like the US did after 9/11 and has attacked Palestine relentlessly. \n\nSince then, I've seen a large population of left leaning and LGBTQ+ people supporting Palestine, as well as rightist nazi 4channers. This confounds me. I expect the nazi 4channer types to support Hamas because they hate jews and Israel, but the other side confuses me.\n\nMy understanding is a large amount of palestinians support the terrorist attack, and also a lot of muslims hate LGBTQ+ people and would kill them if they could.\n\nSo I don't understand how anyone part of those communities could support people who hate them and would kill them, just because Israel is taking revenge.\n\nI feel like if you do a terrorist attack, you're now in the \"find out\" phase of the \"fuck around and find out\" phase.\n\nLooking for some perspective on why so many leftists support Hamas/Palestine on this. What do they honestly expect Israel to do in response to this attack? If the attack leads to Israel bending the knee, wouldn't that encourage more muslim terrorists to attack Israel? they can't afford to look weak.\n\nI'm open to having my view changed but I do strongly think it's foolish and a case of \"living in an ivory tower\" if you're part of these communities and pledge your support of Palestine/Hamas.\n\nedit: I've received a far bigger response than I can possibly fully respond too, but several people gave me more perspective and I've awarded deltas accordingly.

  "selftext": "It's becoming a bit of a hot topic in recent weeks where people are claiming that the chant \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" is antisemitic or a call for genocide. Suella Braverman, the Home Secretary of the UK, called the phrase \"deeply offensive\", and a Labour MP has been suspended for saying \"We will not rest until we have justice. Until all people, Israelis and Palestinians, between the river and the sea, can live in peaceful liberty.\" This is wrong and is playing right into Israel's attempt to paint all anti-Zionists as antisemites.\n\nThe chant started in the mid-1960s by the PLO as a call for Palestinian liberation. The Likud party even had the phrase \"between the Sea and the Jordan there will only be Israeli sovereignty\" in their founding charter in 1977. It was a phrase that predates Hamas or any terrorist organisations in Palestine. There is no doubt that Hamas included this phrase in their 2017 charter and has genocidal intent, but most people who chant it are not calling a genocide but for Palestinian liberation.\n\nSome people take issue with what happens to Israel if \"Palestine is free\". There are many visions of what would happen to the Israeli state should Palestine be free. Some are very tame, like the release of Palestinian prisoners who are held without charge, while some are incredibly extreme, like calling for the genocide of all Israelis. But the fact is most people who chant it, including Palestinians, are either seeking a two-state solution where Palestinians are free citizens of Palestine in or out of Israel, or a one-state solution that is inherently secular and treats all its citizens equally. Neither of these solutions are antisemitic or genocidal.\n\nIn fact, if you look at what [ADL said about the chant](https://archive.ph/ho3e5) _before Oct 26th_, I would agree. The chant _can be_ distressing to Jewish people, especially if the chants are used in front of synagogues as an example, but it is not always used in that manner. But if you look at [the updated page](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/allegation-river-sea-palestine-will-be-free) today, they have declared this phrase as an antisemitic slogan, which is part of their propaganda to equate anti-Zionism and antisemitism together.\n\nTo CMV, you need to show that any form of Palestinian liberation fundamentally leads to the genocide of Israelis, or that the most common usage of the chant is antisemitic. I do not accept the argument that any anti-Zionist chants are antisemitic, because I do not think anti-Zionism is inherently antisemitic. If you wish to make that argument, please read[ this piece](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/mar/07/debunking-myth-that-anti-zionism-is-antisemitic) by Peter Beinart, an American Jewish columnist.",

I could cite numerous other articles, but that ISW article alone makes the case convincingly enough.\n\nThe European Union may be taking measures to cut off Orban/Hungary's veto or circumvent him in order to get $50 billion of European aid to Ukraine, which is a separate matter but would be a good thing if it's done. But as far as the United States is concerned (since most people in this sub are American,) there is $61 billion in aid that is being held up for Ukraine right now because of Republican demands for reform on asylum, migrants, the Mexican border, etc. Zelensky already paid a visit to Congress specifically to try to win legislators over on this issue but to no avail. There is still $4.8 billion remaining in the American budget for Ukraine but that won't cover much.\n\nAs much as Democrats loathe the idea of caving in to the R's on this, the brutal truth is that **time is on the Republicans' side, not the Democrats' or Ukraine's**. The Mexican border and migrants coming in is a relatively *non*\\-urgent situation - not much will happen if it persists. The Ukraine situation is *very* dire and urgent - *lots* of bad things can happen if unaddressed. **In other words, the Rs can afford to wait; the Ds cannot.**\n\nAs of now, there is no indication the Rs are going to drop the border/asylum/migrant-reform demands, and the Ds already missed a golden chance to get the bill done and sent to Biden's desk before Congress shut down for the winter recess (the Senate is still staying in to get work done but the House went home.) The soonest this could get done is January 2024 and Ukraine will have already begun to feel a severe pinch from the delay.\n\nIf the Ds continuously refuse to give way on the border/asylum bill, then Ukraine will likely start to see heavy losses and be forced to ration increasingly scarce ammo and artillery as Russia gains more and more \"freedom of maneuver\" and starts to outflank and outrange Ukrainian forces. One thing will snowball on the other and it could get exponentially bad. This could then lead to Russia rolling Ukraine as far deep as it did in early 2022 or even worse.",

It appears that this IDF official is counting all adult men as Hamas fighters, which is consistent with what the [US has done](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html) in the war against Al-Qaeda, so this explains the \"5000 Hamas fighters\" that is widely reported.\n\nNow, I'm sure people will quote the hospital blast story (which[ the numbers](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20231018-what-we-know-about-the-deadly-blast-at-gaza-city-s-al-ahli-hospital) are disputed even in Gaza) or how on certain days children's death toll is higher than the overall death toll to dismiss the death tolls. I do not deny that this figure is inaccurate and at times unreliable, but it's unreasonable to expect Gaza health officials to count deaths reliably in a war zone. I mean, even Israel had to revise their death toll from Oct 7th from 1,400 to 1,200. It's difficult for governments to calculate the death toll precisely amidst the chaos, but I don't see any reason why we should doubt Gaza's numbers any more than numbers reported by other governments in times of crisis. Their numbers are preliminary estimates and useful for tracking the devastation over time.\n\nEdit: use a different source for UN report.",

  "selftext": "The big unspoken assumption that drives Democratic support for pro-illegal-immigrant stances (such as amnesty, a stop to deportations, a path to citizenship, etc.) - and Republican opposition to illegal immigration (such as arrests, deportations, a border wall, no citizenship, etc.) - is **the belief that most illegal immigrants would lean Democratic, and vote Democratic, if given the right to vote.**\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans tend to hold this same assumption. It is the big unspoken driver and motivator behind both parties' policies. Whether this assumption is actually *correct* or not isn't really relevant; it's what both *believe*.\n\nIf you are a Democrat, and think most illegal immigrants would vote (D) in the future, why *wouldn't* you want them in America, and be given the right to vote? It would be a massive boon to your party at the ballot box. Similarly, if you are a Republican, and think most illegal immigrants would vote Democratic, then of course you'd oppose them tooth and nail. Letting millions of them come in and vote (D) at the polls would be electoral suicide.\n\nTo put it another way, **if most illegal immigrants held MAGA views, were pro-Trump, and were known to be very conservative, the D's and R's would flip stances in an instant.** There's *no way* the D's would allow tens of millions of MAGA Trumper illegal immigrants to come in and be given the right to vote in America; that would be electoral suicide. Similarly, Republicans would be welcoming as many such migrants as they could.\n\nOf course, there are other factors involved in the debate - whether such migrants take jobs from Americans, whether the border facilities can handle them, whether there are unsafe people (i.e., terrorists or drug cartel members in the mix,) etc. But the overall main crux of the issue is how these illegal immigrants would vote, if given the right to vote.",

  "title": "Cmv: The reason why most young men are single is because they're simply too afraid to approach women.",
  "selftext": "We've heard the stats about how there's so much more single young men than there are young women within the 18-29 range. I believe it was around 62% of men in that age range were single where as around 30% for women. This has been a huge topic of discussion this past year and lots of people have blamed things like dating apps, womens high standards, social media and so on. While I do believe that these things play a role I think the biggest thing that's fueling this is that younger men just don't have the confidence to approach and chat up women as much as previous generations did. According to research, around 50% of men from age 18-25 have never even approached a woman in person. So of course if men aren't even putting in effort and trying to initiate contact with women then of course they are going to be remain single. And the number one reason that men of this age range states for lack of approach with women wasn't fear of being accused of sexual assault or allegations but rather a fear of REJECTION. \nNow as a 25 year old man myself I can sort of reasonate with this. Our generation have been lectured heavily on sexual assault briefings whether it be from schools or jobs and when you're constantly being told these messages about SA and consent. And also hearing all these stories in the media like Amber heard and most recently Trevor braurer with false allegation stories. Yes I believe lots of guys will become hesitant to approach women but that's just my perspective.\nThings like the red pill/manosphere has made points about how womens standards have become delusional which I do agree to some extent this might be true. But I think this really mostly apply to big urban metropolitan areas like LA, New York, Miami etc where if you're not a millionaire you're basically a nobody so I don't think for average normies this is the case.",

  "title": "CMV: People who treat stuff like loli hentai anywhere even close to actual real CP and other forms of exploitation, don't think those things are wrong for the right reasons in the first place",
  "selftext": "So, as someone in the Anime community, I pretty often run into arguments about lolis - To the uninitiated, a \"loli\" is an Anime character who, regardless of their canonical age, has the physical appearance of a little girl (\"Shota\" being the boy version) - and specifically the sexualization of them. It's true that it's relatively common for loli (And, to a lesser extent, shota) characters to be sexualized, and even hentai (Drawn porn) of them isn't uncommon.\n\nA lot of people (Both haters and those who are otherwise fans of Anime) deride those who make and enjoy stuff like that as pedophiles, and it's pretty clear from the disgust and vitriol involved that they don't just mean that in the academic sense (That is, people who are attracted to prepubescent bodies/behavior, which might be true), they're legitimately viewing the people in question in the same light as they'd view actual child molesters. That always strikes me as ridiculous, since the fact that it's a fictional character being sexualized instead of a real child prevents the two from being anywhere even close to the same moral *league*.\n\nMy logic is pretty simple; The reason stuff like CP and other forms of exploitation/sexualization of minors is wrong is because the child in question is too young to consent to that sort of thing, and is therefore being harmed. Therefore, if there's no real child involved, then, all else equal, there's nothing wrong with it. Even if loli hentai would be CP if the character in question was real, the fact that they're not real makes all the moral difference.\n\nNow, that part isn't the view I want changed/challenged; It's not one I'm uncertain about in the slightest, and I can't really imagine an argument that *could* change it. No, the view I want challenged relates to the people who don't follow the above logic, who *do* morally condemn loli hentai on the same level of CP.\n\nTo my mind, the only reason one would do that is if they think my logic doesn't cover the reason, or at the very least, not the *only* reason, CP is actually wrong. The only other reason I can think of to condemn CP that would also apply to loli hentai is that, rather than thinking about the victim, or lack thereof, the person's main concern is that they're grossed out  by the idea of being attracted to prepubescent bodies/behaviors in the first place.\n\nOf course, needless to say, there's nothing wrong with being disgusted by that concept, but that disgust is not, in and of itself, valid grounds for moral condemnation. On top of that, if it's the only, or even just the primary, grounds on which you're condemning CP and other forms of real child exploitation, then I don't think you're giving nearly enough weight to the actual victims themselves.\n\nTo explain my logic as to why I don't think personal disgust at a concept is enough to condemn it, I'll use the example of something else in the hentai... Community, for lack of a better word, that I myself personally find disgusting; Vore. Again to the uninitiated, vore is a fetish revolving around the idea of being swallowed whole and digested, with some people liking the idea of being swallowed, and others liking the idea of doing the swallowing. When I first heard about the concept of vore, it turned my stomach, no pun intended, and although it doesn't quite squick me out as much as it once did, it's still not anywhere close to my cup of tea. Still, though, not once did I ever morally condemn those who like vore, and certainly never on the same level as those who partake in actual real cannibalism IRL. \n\nThe logic is exactly the same as with loli stuff; It's so victimless, it's not even a crime in my eyes. In essence, no harm, no foul, and if anything, equating it to situations where harm *is* actually being done is extremely disrespectful to the victims thereof. The only reason I can see to equate real crimes to fictional fantasies about the same subject is if you're operating primarily based on how much the subject in question triggers your squick factor, and that's not a good basis for your morality.\n\nSo, that's my argument, in essence. There are definitely parts of it that I'm open to changing, and there are a few different avenues of attack you might use that I see potential in, but it's my understanding that trying to railroad counterarguments like that is considered bad form on this Subreddit, so I'll leave that up to all of you. \n\nOne last thing I will say, though, is that, if you're looking to engage in good faith, insinuating that the people you're arguing against are pedophiles, let alone actual sex offenders, or otherwise defending them, is a good way to shut down all constructive discourse and end the conversation in a hurry. We all agree that the exploitation of real children is wrong, let's go from there.",

  "title": "CMV: The term Zionist is used a weapon against Jews and has big antisemitic undertones",
  "selftext": "EDIT: I'm amending my view to say it's not that people shouldn't use the term Zionist, they should just be aware of how others might use it as a way to mask their antisemitism. People should make clear attempts to push antisemitism from their surroundings so that the discussion regarding Zionism stays on point and not used to further push hate towards marginalized groups who are unrelated to the point in question.\n\nThe main things that changed my view is considering how Anti-Israeli protests are now used as vehicles to hide antisemitism, so at this point it really doesn't matter if you use anti-zionism or anti-israeli. And if you switch to a third term, that one would be used as well. \n\nInstead we need to be aware of antisemites and make an effort to remove them from the discussion. We must not ignore or belittle the attacks going on against Jews right now and ignore the connection to anti-Israeli rallies. Looking away is wrong. \n\nWhen it was happening to Muslims in the 2000s,  we didn't look away. We realized legitimate criticism of Islam was being used as a vehicle to paddle Islamophobia. The left has course corrected a bit too far IMO where there can't be any criticism of Islam, as to not seem Islamophobic. We should find a balance, but doing one for Muslims and the opposite for Jews - well, that certainly is not a good look. \n\n\\----------------------------------  \n\n\n\\*\\*I'll start with the view and then explain:\\*\\*Using the term Zionist is a often a dogwhistle attack at Jews and is incredibly antisemitic, some use it legitimately, but because of the difficulty in distinguishing the two and the accusatory nature of use by almost all people - it should be seen as antisemitic and removed from speech.\n\n**Now to clarify:**\n\nFirst, I am aware that Zionist is a term Jews created and are using themselves in Israel all the time in legitimate use. To those unfamiliar, it is a term derived from the word Zion - another name for Jerusalem, and embodies the hopes and wishes of Jews in exile to one day return home and rebuild an Israeli country to call their own.To put simply - It is an ideological view that there should be a Jewish homeland for Jews and it should be in Zion. And while there are a lot of different views within that ideology about how, when and where the base concept is that.\n\nAnd it is also okay to be critical against that view ideology without being antisemitic\\*.\n\n**So why do I still think it's antisemitic?**\n\n0 - Preface - I'll preface by saying this is not universal, and there might be plenty who use the term Zionist in good faith and have no ill intent. But because it's indistinguishable from those who do have ill intent, the good people end up being a shield for antisemites to hide behind and whitewash their racist hate.1 - **Negative context of the term** \\- So to start, it is quite clear that when many discuss Zionism outside of Israel and the Jewish world, they intend it as a negative action of taking other people's land and forcibly building a country in it. It connects Israel's current actions which are perceived as genocide and attempted ethnocleansing of another population in the purpose of realizing the full Zionist dream. It looks at the actions of 1948 through the lens of the end results of today, and sees the whole concept of Zionism as corrupt and poisonous from the very roots of it.And thus for many people, supporting Zionism is for all intents and purposes supporting genocide.\n\n2 - **Interlinking the (negative) term with Jewish people** \\- Because Zionism deals with the Jewish population, it ends being a question of each Jew if they support Zionism or not. Nowadays, it is being asked in a pretty aggressive manner towards many Jews whether or not they're Zionists. Even removing the negative context, this has antisemitic undertones since you're posing a question only towards one ethnic group and when you add the context, you're basically putting their backs against the wall, painting a target and then giving them one last chance to correct themselves.It is an attempt to separate the \"clean\" Jews from the \"dirty\" ones, and while it's a question now - how long before it's an assumption made towards every Jew without giving them time to distance themselves.\n\nThis is basically linking the two terms together, and ignoring the fact Zionists can be (and are) non-Jews too.\n\n3 - **Using the terms interchangeably** \\- In places where antisemitism is more widespread, like many Arab countries, the two terms are used pretty interchangeably, with some organizations only using the term Zionist as to avoid being seen as antisemitic. And whether or not the use is purposeful or a a byproduct of years of rhetorics against Israel - the result remains the same. A Jew is a Zionist and a Zionist is a Jew.\n\n4 - **The historical use of the term to raise antisemitism in the world** \\- When we look back to the start of Zionism, and the previous wave of antisemitism in the world, we can see that anti-zionism was used heavily as a tool to spread antisemitism around the world. The fact that there really was a Zionist organization in the start of the 20th century helped it be a pointed weapon towards Jews, creating big conspiracy theories about Zionists and their plans for world domination. Most famously, the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' was the biggest fabricated weapon to target Jews indirectly. It originated in Russia as part of the protests and pogroms against Jews which displaced and killed thousands of Jews.It was later adopted by Hitler and used to showcase reasons to hate the Jews, pointing and linking Zionism and Jews. While internally, Hitler didn't discuss Zionism much - externally, he used it as the primary export with which to spread antisemitism in other countries, most specifically, in Arab countries.And it worked too, Arab leaders were already weary of Zionist attempts to settle in Palestine, buying land and immigrating there in masse, and the 1917 Balfour Declaration served as proof that something sinister is brewing. So when Nazi relations with Arab countries tightened, it was easy to point the finger towards all the Jews living in their lands and paint them as evil Zionists that should be killed or expelled (ironically pushing them to Israel).Jews living in many of these Arab countries did not leave due to Zionism, but rather being pushed out for their religion/ethnicity. So there's a demonstrable example of how Anti-Zionism ends up in Antisemitism.\n\n5 - **Anti-Israel vs Anti-Zionism** \\- Most anti-Zionist are also not really arguing against the ideological belief that Jewish people should have a home but rather the current actions of the Israel government which might be rooted in Zionism, but aren't necessarily linked. Anti-Zionism might have had a purpose in the years leading up to 1948 since Israel was still not a fact and one could argue against the idea or concept of its formation. But it's been 75 years since, and at this point any beef one has against Israel should be against Israel. There's no reason to be against Zionism since Zionist has already been realized.But more to the point, if you object to what you perceive as genocide or ethnic cleansing, and object to Israel's apartheid practices against Palestine, you should object to Israel or Israel's government. Zionism has nothing to do with it (Well, I concede that Israelis are still motivated by Zionism and one can say that the current government is lead by extreme zionistic ideology. But why muddle the water here when it's easier to stay clean and just object and criticize Israel's current regime).\n\n6\\* - **Complexity of being anti-Zionist** \\- Even if we say there's merit here to be criticize Zionism since Israel's government is lead by that ideology, what exactly is anti-Zionism? Is it being against Israel as a concept in general, is it against Israel being where it is, or is it just against the idea of  Israel expanding?Since at the base of it Zionism is the ideology that Jews should have a homeland. Being against that, is in a way, being against Jews having an ethnic home. Something that 90%+ all other ethnic groups have and something that all big religions have too, a religious country that protects it. Christianity has plenty (Greece, Denmark, Norway, Argentina, Hungary, Iceland, the Vatican obviously) and Muslim obviously has many countries were Islam is the dominant and protected religion. If you object to the idea of a religious state, why not object to those of other religions?\n\nIf you accept that Judaism should have a home and only object to the location, then you only partially object to Zionism which makes it harder to be completely anti-Zionist, but more to the point - Where then? If you object to Zionism at this point in time - are you not just calling for the banishment of 8M Jews from what they've known as their home for the past 75 years, most born to only know it as their home. How is anti-Zionism then not a call to ethnic cleansing?(And if you only object to further expansion and current occupation, then you're pretty much objecting to Israel's actions first and foremost so why tie it with Zionism when that makes it much less clear what you object to).\n\n7 - **Parallels to Jihad -** Just to paint a wider picture here. As a Jewish person, asking me pointedly if I'm a Zionist only because of my ethnicity (as many Jews are practically atheists) especially when it's clear you see Zionism as evil is no different than asking a Muslim if he's a Jihadist. Jihad too is an idea that is even more complex than Zionism and can have plenty of positive implications, but when one asks that of a Muslims, they're obviously relating it to a the negative aspect and ready to attack them. We'd obviously understand how that's wrong even just asking that question, regardless of intention.So why is it not even seen as problematic against Jews?\n\nIn summary, calling someone a Zionist can be a slur since many intend it as an accusation of \"support for occupation, genocide and ethno-cleansing\". That term is only being thrown towards Jews and many use it as a tool to separate Jews who you can hate and Jews you shouldn't. In the past it was used to breed undercover antisemitism and since it's only used against Jews but has \"legitimate\" grounds it's nearly impossible to distinguish between legitimate use of the term and a hate-crime use of it.Because of it, this term should really not be used by anyone who is not antisemitic and can instead be replaced with anti Israel rhetorics which is what most non antisemitic people refer to anyway.  \n",

  "title": "CMV: Capitalism, in its current form, will fail.",
  "selftext": "First, I must disclaim I'm not an economist ; I've not followed any in-depth course in economy. My knowledge is mainly centered about scientific knowledge, though I'm not a scientist either, more of an enthusiast that follows quite closely the fields of basic science (mainly physic, astronomy and in a lesser extent, biology), and engineering since two decades. That's why I come to this CMV, because I suspect there's plenty of flaws in my thinking and I'd like to understand other's(and possibly more knowledgeable) perspective on the matter.\n\nSecondly, I think I have to define what I mean by \"Capitalism in its current form\" for clarity, because I've seen many online discussion around capitalism bog down to endless debate about definitions, which can be fascinating but may not be the point of this CMV.\n\nCapitalism, as far as know and have been educated upon by various (non in-depth) sources has the following core principle in its current form :\n\n* Private ownership of property and mean of productions.\n* Those who do not own mean of production can earn a wage through labour, working for those who do own means of production.\n* Freedom of the consumer to choose whatever they want to buy, granted they are rational agent that will choose in their own interest.\n* A decentralized marketplace to set the price of goods, services and give investment opportunity : the stock market.\n* Private entity can, and should, strive forward larger profit.\n* Freedom of competition : private entities can compete in the market to offer lower price and/or better quality products, or innovate.\n\nThose last three point support the following concept : the existence of the capital. The capital is different, though related, from the basic concept of currency or money that largely predate it : the capital, in a healthy capitalist economy, ***must grow***, which differentiate it from just \"the sum of money people/organization have\". If it doesn't grow, and stagnate, it fails. (I'll be honest and say this point, while important in the construction of my view, is also the one I'm not so sure to have properly grasped)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, to my view : Capitalism, in its current form, is fundamentally unsustainable and will fail. This is not an observation based on ethical or moral principle, though to be transparent I have a lot of those with Capitalism, they are not the point of this view. I'm not even *wishing* for it to fall, because systemic collapse bring a lot of pain. This view come from the following observation :\n\n1. Growth of the capital and wealth never has been decoupled from material consumption of goods, and I don't think it's physically possible to really decouple it since every action, every good and every service that can be sold , loaned or produced require an underlying industrial infrastructure that, as optimized in efficiency as it can be, will always produce waste. There are physical limit on how efficient a system is, and there will always be waste and a part of the material consumption that will never be re-usable.\n2. Humankind become larger and larger until it will hits the stabilization population at around 11 billion human^(1), and each and every single human has larger and larger expectation about their own material comfort, that a Capitalist society pretty much succeeded to bring on large scale.\n3. There is no way, in my  observation, that the material comfort brought by a capitalist society will ever be less seductive than a more sustainable, and obviously more restrictive, lifestyle. People that have already access to this comfort want to keep it^(2) and people who do not have access to it want to reach it, for good reasons. And Capitalism is the quickest and easiest way to achieve it in a short timescale, albeit a very inefficient and wasteful way to do it ; more so, its inner working encourage individual to reach maximum profit in a minimum timescale.\n4. Earth is a closed system with limited resources, and most of the resources that support modern lifestyle are in smaller quantities than we suspect them to be : rare earth, certain mineral, clean water, oil (that has to be phased out for climate reason anyway), etc.\n5. Therefore, from point 1, 2, 3 and 4 put together, come the conclusion that there are physical limitation that care fundamentally incompatible with capitalist unlimited growth.\n\nRecently, Capitalism, in light of the physical limitation observed in the last half-century, has rebranded itself with a Green Capitalism coat of paint that don't do anything to address the underlying problem that unlimited growth, meaning unlimited material consumption growth, is unsustainable. I think that this point isn't much contentious when you look at Earth as an isolated system, but I've often seen the argument that there's plenty of ressources up for grab in our solar system and that we'll replace oil and wasteful product through innovation, therefore : \"don't worry, we'll make everything electric and mine asteroid and we'll be fine\".\n\nI'm not sure if I'm overly pessimistic about that, but I for sure am under the impression that this argument rely on a naive optimism over our technological and logistical capabilities as a species.\n\nWhile there are plenty of private and public endeavour to prospect the feasibility of it all, we're not there yet ; I'd say we're not even sure it's feasible in the first place. It often ignores the absolute logistical hell that represent bringing ressources from space to Earth, or manufacturing in space, in a scale large enough to sustain the world industry, and the energy (and material) cost that come with it.\n\nThe timescale of feasibility of space exploitation (which is, in my opinion, the only possible solution to keeping the material growth going) is way longer that the timescale of actual resources depletion and ecological/climate collapse that stem from the very industries that support the capitalist economy.\n\nAnd this economy has grown out of this \"miracle substance\" that is oil in a way that is so deeply rooted in its very inner working that phasing out of it is not possible without a drastic cost in material comfort in short or even medium term. And mind you, I'm not necessarily talking about fossil fuel, because we certainly are doing progress in that regard (it pushes the bill to other resources, like rare earth and minerals anyway), but plastics. They are so fundamental to our way of life and the modern capitalist economy that we don't like to think about it too much ; and it's not even taking into account the plastic and microplastic pollution that is being more and more considered to be a catastrophe on a global scale in matter of health and biosphere. And there are no alternative to large scale plastic production as of now and nothing to see on the horizon, for the exception of some fringe bioplastic that are not suitable for industrial scale and poses their own set of problems AFAIK.\n\nThose kind of hope (space exploitation, phasing out of oil quickly, keeping our level of comfort while not depleting resource or hitting planetary limit) rely on the belief that the century and a half of incredible growth we had as a species is the norm, not the exception. That innovation will, inevitably, find a solution, when there is no indication that it's a rule of existence rather than an incredible bubble of history we've been lucky to live through. That consumers will find reason in being less consumerist and producer will see the light and accept not producing as much waste in research of greater profit at any cost, despite the fact that both have every incentives to not do so.\n\ntl;dr : In my view, Capitalism, as an economic model, is not compatible with scarcity both in its systemic inner-working and in its cultural norm, and scarcity is on the horizon.  Therefore, capitalism is becoming obsolete and will fall (albeit a slow death I suppose) when it cannot sustain its own growth anymore. We should acknowledge that and prepare (not in the bullsh\\*it survivalist way mind you, but as a society, and civilization), to lesser the suffering that come from a collapse of an economical system that has become one of the central pillar of our civilization ; either by thinking of some alternative (and, for anyone wondering : no, I don't think it's communism, not by a long shot) or some deep transformation of capitalism that make it fundamentally sustainable on long term... but would it still be capitalism, then?\n\n^(1:This is not an anti-overpopulation trojan, I have no fundamental problem with the Earth being inhabited by 11 billion people, or more. It's just an observation.)\n\n^(2: It's not a critic or a shame, I myself live in material comfort I'm not ready to give and I perfectly understand people who don't want to lose any.)",

  "selftext": "I've often heard discussions about the potential dangers of overpopulation, but after delving into the topic, I've come to believe that the concerns surrounding overpopulation are exaggerated. Instead, I propose that underpopulation is a much more significant threat to society. \n\n\n\n1. **Resource Management and Technology Advancements:** Many argue that overpopulation leads to resource scarcity and environmental degradation. However, history has shown that technological advancements and improved resource management have consistently kept pace with population growth. Innovations in agriculture, energy production, and waste management have helped support larger populations without jeopardizing the planet.\n\n\n\n2. **Demographic Transition:** The majority of developed countries are already experiencing a decline in birth rates, leading to aging populations. This demographic transition can result in various economic and societal challenges, including labor shortages, increased dependency ratios, and strains on social welfare systems. Underpopulation can lead to a reduced workforce and a decline in productivity.\n\n\n\n3. **Economic Implications:** A shrinking workforce can lead to decreased economic growth, as there will be fewer individuals contributing to production and consumption. This can potentially result in stagnation, reduced innovation, and hindered technological progress.\n\n\n\n4. **Social Security and Healthcare Systems:** Underpopulation can strain social security and healthcare systems, as a smaller working-age population supports a larger elderly population. Adequate funding for pensions, healthcare, and elder care becomes challenging, potentially leading to inequality and reduced quality of life for older citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of overpopulation leading to catastrophic consequences overlooks the adaptability of human societies and the potential for technological innovation. Instead, underpopulation poses a more pressing threat, impacting economies, and social structures.",

  "title": "CMV: Liberal media bias and its impact on the electorate in the United States is overblown, and mainstream media is underappreciated by Americans.",
  "selftext": "Note, first allow me to introduce myself. I am a 23, almost 24-year-old (my birthday is in less than four weeks) man from Alabama, although my political views differ from those that are normal here in AL as I am liberal. (Generally a separate issue, but I'll admit that me being bisexual is a big reason for that, but alas)\n\nSince the late 2010s (first arguably became an issue for me in 2017, though it particularly escalated in 2019 because Donald Trump, who was the President of the United States at the time, was facing the impeachment inquiry that was authorized by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which ultimately led to the House approving the articles of impeachment against President Trump by the end of that year), because no surprise, pretty much my whole immediately family is conservative since we're from the South and all white, I've dealt with a lot of my family members, even before my actual political views came out into the open and, again unsurprisingly, led to a chafing reaction from them, but even before my political views became clear to these relatives by 2019, for instance, I was getting flack from an uncle of mine as far back as the summer of 2017 just because I would post news article to my Facebook page that weren't even about political topics, and yet he attacked me because they were from \"liberal, anti-Trump\" sources. Apparently, to him, anything that criticizes Donald Trump is bad.\n\nAnyways, I must admit in all of this that 2019 was a pretty transformative year when it came to this, and not in a good way. Perhaps I made a mistake on Facebook endorsing that I wanted Trump impeached for his bullying and cajoling of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky (my political views were actually more moderate back then than they are now, even if I'm not even **that** left of the center even by US standards, but I wasn't like many Democrats in that I didn't want Donald Trump impeached until that happened and Rudy Giuliani made his concession on CNN that he and Trump had been trying to dig up dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden and had even pressured the-then US Ambassador to Ukraine in the process, which to me, came off as Watergate-level tactics). To me, Donald Trump had done a **major** obstruction of justice (hence the Watergate comparison), and it seemed like, even if it was a probably similar feeling, seemed like bigger potatoes to me than when my mom was so outraged and disgusted by Bill Clinton's denial in 1998 about having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nThe main reason I state that the beginning of the fall in 2019 was the beginning of a \"domino effect\", basically, is that after Trump's Ukraine scandal came out and he got impeached a few months later, a whole bunch of other events happened politically as well, all really in the span of a year and a half alone up until early 2021: COVID-19 broke out and under Donald Trump's leadership (or, in my view, lack thereof), the United States became the worst-hit nation by the onslaught of a new pandemic; and also, not only, of course, did Joe Biden ultimately become Trump's challenger for re-election, Biden ultimately defeated him, which led Donald Trump, without any sort of supporting evidence or justification, to try to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election, and that of course led to the attack on the US Capitol building three years ago to this day. (That also, of course, got Trump impeached a second time)\n\nI'm sorry I've gotten long-winded. Basically, though, my point is that events took place from 2017 to 2021 that caused a lot of this to escalate (particularly literally in just the span of sixteen months alone, give or take, from roughly September 2019 to January 2021), and apparently, the thing that uncle of mine got most angry about was that I believed \"liberal media\", particularly about Donald Trump. (Now I'm hardly on speaking terms with him and his wife; by late in the year in 2021, they unfriended me on FB because apparently they blamed me for the existence of the \"disastrous Biden administration\", since yes, I did vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 election; the 2020 election was the first presidential election I was eligible to vote in as I was born in 2000, and for the record, I will admit I have pretty much no regrets about my vote for Biden, the closest I came was during the withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, though I doubt it could've been done in a much better way, especially if Trump had gotten re-elected) I'm bringing up this matter now in 2024 because that \"liberal media\" buzzword is still used by my family, on both sides, heavily-another uncle of mine was using it today to criticize my liberal views, claiming I'm brainwashed by the likes of CNN, NBC, etc., and was stating this because he apparently found it offensive that I didn't consider the attack on the nation's capitol on January 6, 2021, to have been orchestrated by the FBI to have made Trump supporters look bad, or how I don't agree with his viewpoint that everyone who entered the Capitol has gotten draconian sentences and needs an immediate pardon. He also likewise claimed the mainstream media is why I think American democracy is in jeopardy, why I don't see a compelling case to impeach Joe Biden based on his son's actions in Ukraine or China or for Hunter allegedly getting money from Russian figures, why I don't also consider the Biden administration's policies on immigration and the US-Mexico border to be impeachable, or how I don't believe Joe Biden has dementia or Alzheimer's disease. He is also angry at me-and this is a more pertinent point regarding mainstream media-for not being mad at those news sources regarding their reporting of allegations of Donald Trump having compromising ties to Russia, and how I refuse to embrace the term \"Russia hoax\".\n\nSee, to me, mainstream media is underrated. It's by no means perfect, but in my view, many of the same news sources American right-wingers vociferously and viscerally hate (and ironically, I make an effort to look at all news sources, both liberal and conservative-leaning, even though I can't stand much of the slant the likes of Fox News and New York Post do, but I at least **try** to keep up with the talking points of the American right more than anything else, since they're going to affect me anyway) have tried to be objective in ways that I'd argue are more apparent than right-leaning news sources, that fewer news sources even have a liberal bias than they claim, and if they **do** have a bias, tend to be more biased towards centrism and neoliberalism more than anything else. (Ever wonder why Cenk Uygur, the founder of The Young Turks, considers the sources I've stated to be \"corporate\"?)\n\nThat leads me to admit more concessions for me to make about my views: I'm a neoliberal, establishment-aligned Democrat. Perhaps I have some confirmation bias going on in that I sometimes wonder if these biases these sources have is potentially a sign that neoliberal, establishment governance with heavy influence from experts is the best way to go (although much of my sentiment here was shaped by the pandemic). I'm also admittedly a major policy wonk, although the fact that I majored in political science in university could be an influence there, too. (I do have some sympathies for Stephen Colbert's quote that \"reality has a liberal bias\")\n\nJust to note, I'm not trying to say that liberals, even establishment liberals, never try to put a spin on things. The main point I'm trying to make is that I don't get what I'm doing wrong, since I get attacked endlessly by my family just for where I choose to mostly get my news from. (Another irony is that I don't even use those sources they hate the most that much, I mainly use BBC and Vox, though I will admit I also really like the New York Times and the Washington Post, both of which make MAGA supporters angry) I do agree that trying to limit bias is a good thing, but I see no good-faith effort by the right to do so, and some things, like January 6, just cannot be bothsidesed. Anyways, I posted to this subreddit because, even if my view seems unpopular, I want to know if it's actually a viewpoint that **needs** changing that I think that mainstream media, even if it has its flaws, has the supposed \"liberal\" bias (one of those uncles went as far in 2020 as to call it \"far-left\", which again, given what I said about Cenk Uygur, seems ridiculous) that conservatives keep complaining about be overblown, and that MSM is often underrated by the public anyway.\n\nOne last note: someone even told me that the media somehow caused Donald Trump to not get re-elected, just because it was portraying his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic in a negative light. Again, I fail to see how \"the media\" is so powerful it could have that type of effect, and that type of effect alone.",

  "title": "CMV: “The Great Reset” is partially correct",
  "selftext": "For those of you unfamiliar, “The Great Reset” is a conspiracy theory that specifically states the following- \n\n1. The World Economic Forum (WEF) seeks to disenfranchise the poor worldwide and consolidate all wealth and power to wealthy elites.\n\n2. The WEF also seeks to destroy all democracies and replace them with CCP-style dictatorships, which will prevent the rest of the population from fighting back.\n\n3. Their ultimate goal in the first 2 points is the destruction of the middle class, with most falling into poverty. Those in poverty will be killed off, leading a 95% reduction in the global human population from today's levels.\n\nI believe that a \"soft\" version of this is correct, I don't think that poor people are gonna start being put in gas chambers, and I don't think its the WEF exclusively that's doing it, but I do believe the following bullets as my CMV- \n\n- Big corporations are fiduciarily obligated to grow their wealth as much as they possibly can. This means that not only do they need to consider taking from the poor and middle class, but they actually are legally obligated to do so if its advantageous. \n\n- Because of that first bullet, these same corporations are under no legal obligation to consider the long-term well being of those they've disenfranchised. \n\n- In fact, these same mega corporations would benefit from an increasingly restricted democracy, where their lobbying and bribery would have more sway over legislation, and the consequences of their actions on the broader population would not be punished or addressed. \n\nA good example of how bullet 1 is big investment firms and banks buying single family homes, to the point where 40% of said homes may be owned by Wall Street and rented out by 2030- https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/02/21/how-wall-street-bought-single-family-homes-and-put-them-up-for-rent.html\n\nThis exacerbates the housing crisis in the US, intentionally, and leads to scenarios where many must rent for the rest of their lives. If too many people are forced to rent, then rental prices will skyrocket to the point where many end up on the streets, and then they die.\n\nSame thing with renewable energy, where states like California are banning gas cars at a time where their electric grid cannot handle even existing load, knowingly and intentionally creating an energy crisis that will result in mass deaths on the streets. \n\nThere’s also the uncanny relationship between China and the banking elite, who have continually covered for China, advocated for increased trade with China since the 90’s, and continues to invest in that country, despite gross human rights violations and the horrific realities of that country.\n\nIn fact, Klaus Schwabb, head of the world economic forum, has called China a “model for much of the world”-\n\nhttps://thepeoplesvoice.tv/china-will-be-a-role-model-in-the-systemic-transformation-of-the-world-says-klaus-schwab/amp/\n\nI understand he was mostly talking about their economic success, but the audacity to call China a “model country” during the pandemic when they were putting people in cages arbitrarily “for Covid” at the very least indicates to me that economic success is prioritized over the advancement of democracy, and the former will be picked over the latter when push comes to shove. \n\nThe WEF also played a key role in building the modern CCP in the 1980’s and 1990’s via consulting Chinese leadership directly in economic summits, for what its worth\n\nSo that’s my case I’m hoping to have changed today. I believe wealthy elites and corporations are predominantly interested in continuing to grow their wealth, which requires they take what little assets the rest of us have, and their disregard for our well being during this indicates that they attach no value to our lives. In fact, when push comes to shove, they prioritize their wealth over democracy and basic human freedoms. The result is essentially the great reset of society, where the majority of us will own nothing, have no power to fight back, and must die so as to not over encumber the elites with homeless riff raff on the streets.",

More than that, we both agree that immigration law itself is in need of an overhaul.

It was written with the intent to enforce Article 4, Section 2, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution, which required the return of escaped slaves to their owners. It sought to force the authorities in free states to return fugitives of slavery to their masters.\nDespite the law, many free states and the citizens therein chose to defy both federal AND constitutional law. Some areas even passed laws that countered the federal law, and some juries refused to convict individuals indicted under the Fugitive Slave Act. This is just one of dozens of examples of civil disobedience that I could reference, but I chose this one because I think the parallels are particularly apt.\n\nI’m not advocating for contempt of our constitution, our government, or our elected officials.

  "selftext": "A disclaimer: I'm not here to discuss the generalized argument about whether gun laws save lives. I am SPECIFICALLY centered on this source, and I will only respond to and discuss arguments about this source in particular. The only other sources I'm willing to entertain are sources that appear to study the exact same topic but came back with DIFFERENT results. Studies on unrelated topics are outside of the scope here.\n\nHere's the study in question:\n\n[https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/](https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/)\n\nThe findings of this study in particular are critical, as I believe that these findings make the strongest case I'm aware of that gun laws in the United States do indeed help to reduce gun violence. It also refutes the claim that \"no evidence suggests that gun laws reduce gun violence.\" This study does exactly that, and I think it makes that case better than any other evidence I've seen out there. Simply put, anyone who wants to proceed with the claim that gun laws don't reduce gun violence needs to explain the findings of this study, full stop, or else they are being willfully dishonest.\n\nLet me address a few criticisms I think I will find:\n\n\\- *The study was probably done by a biased institution*. Here's the thing: half of this data is verifiable by your own understanding of American politics, and the other half is just data that anyone can look up. This study makes a correlation between the strength of gun laws and the number of people who died due to gun violence. Regarding the former, the strength of gun laws, I firmly believe that anyone should be able to look at the states and how they are ranked in terms of how strict their gun laws are and realize that the classifications do indeed make sense. Blue states seem to have tighter restrictions. Red states don't. None of that is surprising. And the number of gun deaths? Well either a person was shot to death, or they weren't, right? So this isn't really subject to debate. The data was likely pulled from law enforcement records, so I feel like the only people who you could blame for messing up the data would be these law enforcement officers determining whether or not a person died because of a bullet wound. I just...don't see any real reason to think they'd massively screw that task up, ESPECIALLY not with the intent of biasing the results of a gun control study conducted by Everytown.\n\n\\- *The data shows results for a single point in time, whereas the more interesting data is temporal.* That is true, but if you think about it, you can't really come up with a good reason for why a state that had a low amount of gun violence would suddenly start implementing a bunch of gun laws. If there's no danger to their state, then what's causing them to do this? It's just not a convincing angle in my mind.\n\n\\- *Correlation is not causation*. Sure, but I'm not calling this an iron-clad case by any means. But I am saying it is \"convincing\". If this were confounded by some other variable, you'd have to tell me what that variable is and how it could explain the correlation, and I have yet to hear of a convincing one that would completely blow this correlation up. I don't know how you can just toss out a generic \"correlation is not causation\" here without that logically extending to every single regression analysis ever performed in the history of humanity. ESPECIALLY whichever ones support *your* viewpoint!\n\nTL;DR: this source in particular is a cornerstone of the argument that gun laws do indeed lower gun violence, and I see no reason not to think that it demonstrates exactly that.

In recent decades, Black individuals have risen to \"reclaim\" the word, strip away the power of it, and remind people that the word was historically used in a pejorative way.[\\[1\\]](https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-53749800)\n\nII. Why I don't agree with this 'reappropriation' of the n-word\n\n\"\\[The n-word may be acceptable for African Americans to use it freely, \\[but\\] it is off-limits to whites, whose usage of \\[the n-word\\] cannot be the same, given its history and the general history of racial oppression and racial relations in the United States.\"[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reappropriation#cite_note-:02-1) (citation leads to Wikipedia citation)\n\nI disagree with this. White people, in the past, had used the n-word in a horrible way, yes. But you don't see Jeremy over here saying the n-word in the same way, now, do you? That was done by different people, in a different way, in a different time. Why should we attach the n-word to specific categories, such as being white? Is this not prejudiced itself? We are categorizing an entire race into being incapable of saying specific words because of what their potential ancestors did.\n\nFurthermore, this only gives more power to to word. *\"Bad\"* non-black/white individuals can *still* say the n-word, and it being taboo only gives them *more* incentive to do so.\n\nThere are three different ways of going about this, with the third being what has happened:\n\n1. Have the n-word become an extremely typical and normal word in language, with everyone being \"allowed\" to say it (that is, acceptable to say it.)\n2. Have the n-word outright banned/have it unacceptable for anyone and everybody to say, including those who are black.\n3. Have the n-word be \"taboo\" for everyone except black people. It is acceptable for black people to say the n-word, but is not for those who are not black.\n\nThe first option's reasoning:\n\n1. As there is no taboo attached to the word, there are no people who are going to be non-conforming to the \"rules...\" because there are none.\n2. No more non-black people who attempt to instigate using the n-word \\[in the same way it is used now\\] because, now, it's just a normal word essentially.\n3. The word would be powerless.\n\nI am aware that it is still a good thing for history to be remembered but I don't believe that reclaiming a word for only a select few individuals to be able to say it is the way to go about it. This only causes further division between the arbitrary labels that we have given ourselves based on colour: race. Teach the meaning of the word. Continue to educate those why it had a troubled history and *why* it should no longer be attached to those horrible roots. However, I can see how the troubled history can make the word harder to use, but if that is the case, then let us refer to option 2:\n\nThe n-word should have never been reclaimed/taboo for all people and races. The word, as established, had a terrible history, tied to slavery of a specific race. The word should be taught specifically in a historical context, referring to the problematic usage of the word, but not used in everyday language. Why? Because of the following:\n\n1. The word would not have resurfaced and been used so frequently by people in the modern day, specifically, non-black individuals who are also relatively young.\n\nThat's essentially it; the n-word wouldn't be used as frequently as it is used today. It has been popularized and much more widespread than it likely would have been had it not been reclaimed. It more so just be a fact of history and not necessarily have taboo attached to it.\n\nThat is my reasoning for why the n-word should not have been reappropriated and reclaimed. We have given the word power. Why? Change my view.  \n\n\nedit: So I keep getting accused of being a white person who is a racist, who has ancestry to white slave owners, who is making this post because I want to... say the n word? This is false. I am not American. I am half Korean, a quarter NZ European (Welsh, French), and I am also Polynesian (Samoan/Tokelaun). Please stop accusing me of being racist and desiring to say the n word. \n\nYou're just false, and it makes absolutely no logical sense to accuse me of that when you actually think about that accusation. If I actually did, I wouldn't be making a post on Reddit, on this place of all things. It is ENTIRELY in my CAPABILITY to say the n word but I CHOOSE NOT TO. Why would I do this? It's not like my post is going to alter decades of the evolution of language. It's just a silly accusation. Please stop, not every white person is a child of a slave owner, and not every white person is American.",

  "title": "CMV: Americans are not as poor as they think they are",
  "selftext": "The internet in general and reddit in particular is full of Americans complaining about how poor they are and how they literally (!) can't survive on what they earn.\n\nI accept that many Americans are perfectly sincere in this belief, but that doesn't make it true. **Most Americans** are richer than ever, and richer than most people in the world. The evidence shows that they consume more than ever, live in bigger homes, etc. Most of the people complaining are objectively some of the luckiest people in world history, and the rest of the world is tired of their narcissistic whining. There are lots of actually poor people in the world  (and even in America itself) who deserve our sympathy and help far more.\n\n2 Counter-arguments I reject\n\n**1. Prices have increased therefore Americans are poor (e.g. recent post-Covid inflation; long run increases in house prices, university tuition, health care. )**\n\nI don't deny that prices for many things have increased in recent decades, and this reduces the amount of those things that people can buy. However, this does not necessarily mean that Americans are objectively poor, or poorer than they used to be. Price changes are a normal part of economic development (e.g. as an economy gets richer, food and manufactured goods get cheaper in hours of work you have to put in to get them, while labour-intensive services like education automatically get more expensive). When prices for certain things increase, people have to make trade-offs they didn't have to before, and this may feel unpleasant because they can't have everything they thought they could have (or exactly what their parents had). But they can still buy plenty of nice things, including functional substitutes that are much better than what their parents had.\n\n**2. Inequality: America is rich, but the top 1% took it all**\n\nIt is true that poor people in America are poorer than poor people in other rich countries because the US has unusually high level of income inequality. So I don't deny that **some** Americans are poor. But not most Americans, or the average American, which is the claim I see constantly.\n\nI also don't deny that a disproportionate share of the economic gains of the last 40 years have accrued to the already rich, or that social mobility in the US has declined. One can certainly complain that this is **unfair**, and that the average American would be even richer if economic policies had been different. But that imaginary counterfactual doesn't mean that Americans in general are actually poor against any reasonable benchmark, whether that be meeting their basic needs; the rest of the world; or Americans from previous generations.",

  "selftext": "In 2014 Russia occupied Crimea. They invaded Ukraine, bar none, since then Ukraine has been at war to reclaim Crimea and since the Russian Invasion in February 2022 the war escalated to a full scale Invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussias objectives were simple, take over Ukraine and at the least install a puppet government they can control if not outright make it apart of Russia.\n\nSince then Russia has had their asses kicked and thus changed their objective to basically controlling Luhansk, Donetsk and Crimea. \n\nWhen some people are questioned about this war they simply take the side they are \"Anti War\" and want some sort of magical fairy diplomatic solution to the war. This is impossible unless major Russia policy change happens, which it won't.\n\nRussia has made it know they will not leave peacefully from the Ukrainian states of Luhansk, Donestsk, and Crimea, which all belong to Ukraine bar none, end of story. To say Ukraine should not try and retake their country by any means necessary including the awful and violent war they fight now is absurd. To state simply you are \"anti war\" or are \"anti political and not taking a side (looking at you Sabaton)\" is an endorsement of Russia holding control over these 3 territories currently under Russian occupation and is an endorsement of Russians imperialistic ambitions. Russia wants to world to be ambivalent and feel \"this isn't something that affects me\" or \"I don't want any war!\" So that countries won't back Ukraine and won't give them what they need to oust Russia from Ukrainian territory.. \n\nWar sucks, Ukraine doesn't want to be at war, it does not want to invade and occupy Russia, if they end up doing that I would not support it. What I do support is Ukraine retaking its rightful holdings under International Law. This is not a pro war statement, this is in fact an anti war stance, Ukraine wants what is rightfully theirs and I guarantee if there was a way to get it without a violent and bloody conflict Ukraine would do it. But they cannot because of Russias war of aggression.\n\nSlava Ukraini, Heroyam slava.",

This picture is quite similar to [Dresden's bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/MapPorn/comments/181z60z/map_of_dresden_bombing_in_ww2_which_was/), [Cambodia's bombing](https://data.opendevelopmentcambodia.net/dataset/402115c8-03aa-4ae3-8609-ae993632f941/resource/02cd54f0-5bd0-47a9-ae8c-6d14da4a5de8/download/us-bombing-1965-75.jpg), and  [Laos bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/geography/comments/16b8zfm/map_of_the_bombs_that_were_dropped_on_laos_by_the/). Nearly *all* infrastructure in Gaza City, used by militants or not, are destroyed, fitting the definition of indiscriminate bombings. \n\nA few things to address:\n\n* If you want to say that \"only\" 20,000 died, suggesting a low death to bomb ratio, fine, but bombing campaigns are aimed at *infrastructure*, so as long as the kind of infrastructure attacked is indiscriminate, the campaign is indiscriminate.\n\n* If you want to say Hamas hides themselves in civilians, I'm referring to infrastructure used by militants _or not_. Unless you believe that nearly all buildings in Gaza City are used by militants, then it's indiscriminate.\n\n* Don't bring up genocide or indiscriminate _killing_. I'm not accusing Israel of these in this post, so I won't entertain that rebuttal.\n\n* Warning inhabitants is irrelevant, because civilians and militants receive the same warning, so there's no discrimination between both groups prior to bombing.\n\nTo close this out, here are some quotes from Israeli officials:\n\n> “There is one and only (one) solution, which is to completely destroy Gaza before invading it. I mean destruction like what happened in Dresden and Hiroshima, without nuclear weapons,” Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament \n \n> “Gaza should be razed and Israel’s rule should be restored to the place.\" Moshe Feiglin, the founder of Israel's right-wing Zehut Party and former Likud representative in Israel’s parliament  \n\n>  “The emphasis is on damage, not accuracy,” declared the Israel Defence Forces (IDF).  \n\n> “Gaza will eventually turn into a city of tents,” said one IDF official, adding, “There will be no buildings.”  \n\n> Israel’s economy minister, Nir Barkat, told ABC News that hostages and civilian casualties will be secondary to destroying Hamas, “even if takes a year”.  \n\n> Israel’s former chief military advocate general and the country’s former attorney general no less, who declared that to destroy Hamas “then you have to destroy Gaza, because everything in Gaza, almost every building there, is a stronghold of Hamas”.  \n\nAnd of course Joe Biden's “They’re starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,”\n\n\nIf you can show that MOST of these civilian buildings, key word MOST, are used for military purposes, and the military objective justifies the destruction we see, then you've changed my view\n\n[Amnesty report on indiscriminate attacks](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2023/10/damning-evidence-of-war-crimes-as-israeli-attacks-wipe-out-entire-families-in-gaza/)\n\n[Use of dumb bombs with questionable accuracy](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/13/politics/intelligence-assessment-dumb-bombs-israel-gaza/index.html)\n\n[100k buildings destroyed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67565872)\n\n[42% of housings units in ALL OF GAZA destroyed or damaged in TWO WEEKS](https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-42-housing-units-destroyed-damaged-israel), 28% are uninhabitable\n\n[Israeli sources said the airstrikes were conducted with no concern for hostages](https://www.972mag.com/israel-bombing-endangered-hostages-gaza/)\n\nEdit: A delta has been given because I didn't consider intent. I'm conceding that intent needs to be a factor in charging a war crime. I think the method of execution and the end result fit the bill, but to prove intent is more difficult and it's something I didn't consider. To use a hostage example, if a police officer uses excessive force or has a complete disregard for the hostage's life, and if the officer ends up killing both the hostage and hostage taker, they can be charged with murder depending on the circumstances even if the officer has no intent to kill the hostage.",

  "title": "CMV: anyone who's serious about sustainability should change to a plant-based diet",
  "selftext": "\r  \nStudies have shown the best way for us to reduce deforestation, land use, fresh water use, eutrophication, and biodiversity loss is to change from omnivore diets to plant-based diets.  This is because animal agriculture is the leading driver of all of these factors, and switching to a plant-based diet can reduce them by as much as 75% (example source [1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00343-4), [3](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216)).  Per the FAO, animal agriculture also emits more greenhouse gases than the entire transportation sector.\r  \n\r  \nWe need to protect what is left of our biodiversity and change the way we interact with the environment. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) states we've lost an estimated [69%](https://livingplanet.panda.org/en-US/) of wild animals in the past 50 years, with losses as high as 94% in places like Latin America.  We've already changed the world so much that [96%](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1711842115) of mammalian biomass is now humans and our livestock.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the most common rebuttals to the above is a plant-based diet isn't healthy, and therefore isn't a viable solution for sustainability.  In fact, it can be a major improvement over what many in the west are currently eating.  My country (USA) gets 150-200% of the protein we require and only [5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6124841/) hit the recommended minimum daily fiber intake.  The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics is the largest nutritional body in the world with over 112,000 experts, and [its position](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27886704/) is a plant-based diet is healthy for all stages of life and can reduce the chances of getting the top chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.  I say this to focus the discussion around other topics that are much more likely to change my view.\n\nCorporations and governments won't lead the charge alone against the status quo, so it's important that we as consumers take responsibility at the same time.\n\n\rThe dominant diets in developed nations are based on societal and behavioral norms, but are far from optimal.  It's true that diet is a personal choice, so I hold it is better to choose a diet that is much more sustainable than what we're currently eating.\r  \n\r\r",

But then the state of Israel was partitioned by the UN around the 1950s, and then they have been fighting for territory even since --- with Palestine's territory shrinking to almost less than 2% than what it was in 1930s.\n\nIf the above really is the case, I can somewhat understand the motivations. AGAIN I AM NOT SAYING I AGREE WITH THE EXTENT THAT HAMAS TOOK IT TO --- but that some degree of non-peaceful protest would definitely be solicited. As a racial person myself, I am influenced Malcolm X's \"By any means necessary\" idea --- imagine if someone comes to your house, beats you up, and leaves you with only a plot of mud in the garden while they get all the rest --- would you fight the person?\n\nOf course, I think that there could be other means of unpeaceful protest --- but most sentiment Ive seen so far seems to be very hostile against the sentiment of palestine --- of which I dont understand where thats coming from --- and I really do want to know so I can update myself on the proper understanding of the picture.

  "selftext": "As the title suggests, I’m a gay 23M. I grew up in the LDS faith and had a unique view of the same-sex marriage debate. Admittedly this is a very tough temptation for me— I have a very strong case of same-sex attraction and love the way guys make me feel. That said, I still believe the act, rather than the temptation, is a sin. Here is why:\n\n1. Most of the world religions warn against homosexuality. For whatever reason, homosexual behavior must have presented some anthropological disadvantage historically. Some obvious reasons include the arrangement not being procreative in nature and the destabilization of the family unit. I posit that we still don’t fully understand the unintended consequences of embracing homosexuality on a societal level. \n\n2. LGBT folks, gay men especially, face unique challenges. Sexual access is abundant and is unrestrained by female selectivity. This in part results in the proliferation of sexually transmitted diseases and sexual promiscuity. Open relationships and aversion to commitment create emotional harm for those involve. \n\n3. I believe each human has a deeply encoded moral intuition that can help discern moral permissibility. Even though I know that these feelings are very real and ostensibly wholesome, I still feel deep down that same sex behavior is not aligned with my ideal self. Opponents often insist that this anecdotal feeling is simply collateral damage from religious indoctrination, however, I feel that greatly delegitimizes the shame I feel when I indulge on these temptations. It seems to be more than just internalized homophobia. \n\nI have never had sex with or dated someone of the same sex. I have done more wholesome things such as kissing and cuddling, and while they feel undeniably good, I still feel that deep down it is wrong and not what God wants for his children. I recognize that I am somewhat hypocritical in this stance. \n\nI apologize if any of this comes off as judgmental towards LGBTQ folk. I love them as my brothers and sisters and know their situations are very real and complicated. I love them and admire their incredible compassion and empathy, and believe emphatically that they make the world a much better place. \n\nI am open to new perspectives and hope we can keep the dialogue civil.",

By including it in your eMail signature, it reinforces the idea that pronouns, gender expression and identity are not to be discussed openly.

  "selftext": "For context: I genuinely believe that the Israel-Palestine conflict has roots far beyond the 1948 Nakba. The Palestinians do not hate Jews merely for being forced out of their homes and subjected to ethnic cleansing; they and the rest of the Muslim world hate Israel because it was the first time that Islam lost to the Jews. This is the final straw in Muslim humiliation - how dare the Jews and the Christian West subject the “final religion” to such humiliation. There is a reason Palestine has not accepted any significant peace deal from Israel and there is a reason Palestinian diaspora continue to cause massive civil wars and social destruction in every country they migrate to (Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait, etc) - the Palestinians are angry that they are continuously humiliated by people that Muhammad and the various caliphates used to slaughter effortlessly.\n\nI also believe that the Israelis (and Jews who feel kinship with their “promised land”) don’t view the Palestinians in a secular manner - they genuinely believe that control of “their” holy land is revenge against Islam’s repression for millennia. There’s a reason Israelis and their Zionist supporters want the Palestinians to just “go to Jordan” already - they believe the state of Israel is compensation for the millennia of Jewish suffering; and they clearly think the Caliphate is still around.\n\nIn general, I think the whole planet would be better off without Abrahamic religions. Monotheism is inherently intolerant - Judaism’s hatred of other religions mutated into Christianity’s genocidal mania and Islam’s monstrous imperialism. They are socially destructive and tend to carry iron age prejudices against homosexuals, other religions, liberal lifestyles, etc well past their intended time that mutate into bad ideas. It’s not a coincidence that “clash of civilizations” rhetoric and antipathy is largely a result of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. Had the West and Near East remained pagan, I think we would not have as much problems as we do today. Zoroastrianism was better than any of these narcissistic cults; more peaceful certainly.",

Some where the accused person has then been found guilty and some where they have been exonerated.\n\nThe Kevin Spacey case sounded a lot like this one at first but he has since has his name cleared in court.\n\nSo I am going against trend here but I think we should all suspend judgement and let the legal system and courts do what they are there for which is make a proper judgement of guilt or innocence. Trial by the court of public opinion driven by press coverage is more or less a non-lethal lynch mob.\n\nedit:\n\nA number of people have responded quoting the OJ Simpson case and I thought I would respond here as its going to help understand my thinking at the very least  \nThere are rare and exceptional cases where the court case, the arguments made by the defence, and the verdict of the jury are on a wider issue than the one the prosecutors wanted them to deliver a verdict on.  \nIn the UK we had such a case with Clive Ponting - a civil servant who passed information to a member of parliament and who was prosecuted because that information was secret. The case became about not whether he did it but whether it should in principle be illegal for a civil servant to pass information to an MP for scrutiny in parliament to happen. The jury found him not guilty but I do not know of anyone familiar with the case who believes he did not pass on the secret information, nor that doing so was not illegal at the time. The jury were looking at a wider issue. Their verdict tells us nothing about whether he did it because they were not really delivering a verdict on that. Interestingly subsequent cases of civil servants passing secrets to MPs have not been prosecuted - it has been considered \"not in the public interest\" to do so.  \nSimilarly (and from the distance of another country entirely so take that into account) the OJ case appeared to become about the unreliability and racial bias of the LAPD and whether any black man could get a fair trial in LA. The verdict makes sense as a verdict on that but then it tells us very little about who killed OJ's wife because in reality that is not what the jury were giving a verdict on.  \nThese cases are very rare, very unusual. But they do happen.  \nSo in the OJ case I do not believe the criminal verdict actually informs us much on who killed her - it informs us hugely on whether the LAPD was viewed as deeply biased to the point where all their evidence was considered tainted. Because this was such a unique and special case that my opinion of who killed her is far more informed by the subsequent civil case than would ordinarily be the case.",

And while many liberals may say they oppose \"open borders,\" they will simultaneously endorse policies that are not, practically speaking, much different than open borders (if one says that illegal immigrants shouldn't be stopped from coming here, and, once here, shouldn't be deported, then that's about the same as open borders.)\n\nConservatives, on the other hand, consider illegal immigration to be a crime (anyone remember all the banners that said, \"Which part of the word 'illegal' don't you understand?\") That's why the right-wing is so fierce and angry about the issue, because they think liberals are blatantly turning a blind eye to an ongoing crime. Sure, there are some liberal presidents, such as Obama, that deported many illegal immigrants, but that was perhaps more of either 1) political optics or 2) \"just following the rules.\"\n\nI am not trying to straw-man the liberal stance in any way. If anything, I think (and hope) I am steel-manning the liberal position.\n\nSo, the viewpoint that I have, and am open to get changed, is this: **Liberals think that illegal immigrants are not doing anything morally wrong.

In order to achieve that, Israel must ensure that Gentiles can never obtain any meaningful power within the state, and given that there are significant populations of Gentiles in it, it can only maintain this structure through violence and militarism. This is why Zionists of all forms, socialist, liberal, conservative or Orthodox, present or past, support the militaristic nature of the state, because they recognise that a military is required to maintain Jewish sovereignty in Israel. \n\nI'm sure someone will say that if a 2SS were to be achieved, surely that means Zionism no longer requires violence and militarism, right? No, Zionism does not allow the future state of Palestine to pose a threat to Israel, because this would violate the principle of Jewish sovereignty.

This expectation will lead to woefully inadequate results and is unfair to the poorest 50% of the global population who should be increasing their consumption to improve their quality of life.\n\n**Evidence:** People within the top 10% globally consume [10 times more than they are allocated in order to achieve the goal of  less than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming. In fact, the richest 10% emits as much as the bottom 90%.](https://oxfamilibrary.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10546/621305/bn-carbon-inequality-2030-051121-en.pdf;jsessionid=9C993232BE644C3840513C4916367380?sequence=1)  To be in the top 10% of wealth globally, you need only a [net worth](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/07/how-much-money-you-need-to-be-in-the-richest-10-percent-worldwide.html) of $93,170. The median net worth in the US [is $121k](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/average-net-worth-by-age) meaning that over 50% of the American population falls within the global top 10% that is living \"beyond their means\" in terms of greenhouse gasses.\n\n**Example #1 - Meat and Animal Products:** Americans consume [151kg of meat per capita every year. More than double the world average.](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-type?country=CHN~USA~IND~ARG~PRT~ETH~JPN~BRA~OWID_WRL~ESP~DEU) They consume more than four times the world average of beef which is extra resource intensive. This is an area where the vast majority of Americans have the ability to make a simple, relatively unobtrusive change to their lifestyle to reduce their CO2 emissions by incorporating more plant-based foods but they still refuse.\n\nMost people agree that factory farms are terrible for the environment, animals, and the humans that work in them. At the same time, factory farms are the only way to efficiently produce the amount of meat Americans demand. You cannot have the same amount of meat consumption without keeping these ethically terrible and environmentally disastrous factory farms. Even with the advent of meat substitutes making the transition from meat even easier, many people seem to have the attitude that they will only make the switch when meat substitutes taste *absolutely identical* to animal flesh and costs *the exact same if not cheaper*.\n\n**Example #2 - Flight and automobile travel:** In 2015, [10% of Americans took 5+ trips with 45% of people taking at least one flight](https://news.gallup.com/poll/388484/air-travel-remains-down-employed-adults-fly-less.aspx). To put this in a global context, a single flight from London to New York and back generates about 986kg of CO2 per passenger. [There are 56 countries where the average person emits less carbon dioxide than that flight in a whole year.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2019/jul/19/carbon-calculator-how-taking-one-flight-emits-as-much-as-many-people-do-in-a-year)\n\nMeanwhile, in online discussions and activist movements, almost all the focus is on limiting use of private jets even though [they emit only 2% of overall aviation emissions](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-26/private-jet-emissions-found-to-rise-more-than-commercial-planes#:~:text=While%20private%20jets%20account%20for%20about%202%25%20of,sector%20had%20fully%20recovered%2C%E2%80%9D%20the%20report%E2%80%99s%20authors%20wrote). Don’t get me wrong, I would support any effort to limit the use of private jets but it is clearly not enough. I’m guessing that the idea of disincentivizing 3+ airline trips a year would cause an uproar from most Americans who say that flight prices are already too high.\n\n**Bonus Anecdotal Example –** [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesota/comments/1129ljp/house_democrats_introduce_ban_on_new_gas_lawn/) is the straw that broke the camel’s back for me and prompted my CMV. These responses to the idea that selling gas lawn mowers should be banned starting in 2025 make me lose faith that developed countries will do their fair share to avoid climate disaster. There was a huge backlash to this proposed legislation even though:\n\n\\- It would not take effect for two more years\n\n\\- You could still purchase used gas mowers\n\n\\- They emit an insane amount of greenhouse gasses. A consumer-grade leaf blower emits more pollutants than a 6,200-pound 2011 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor, [according to tests conducted by Edmunds' InsideLine.com.](https://www.edmunds.com/about/press/leaf-blowers-emissions-dirtier-than-high-performance-pick-up-trucks-says-edmunds-insidelinecom.html)\n\nTo me, legislation like this is the bare minimum and should be considered an “easy win” when trying to reduce our per capita greenhouse emissions but is still met with a large pushback and whatabout-isms about the 1%.\n\n**Conclusion/TLDR:** Avoiding the worst effects from climate change will require systemic changes that will impact the vast majority of people in developed countries. Even if it is theoretically possible to overcome, we are making the climate crisis much more difficult than it needs to be by refusing to make sacrifices on the cost, convenience, taste, quality, or quantity of what we consume. Relying on concessions from only the top 1% of people in developed countries will not be enough.\n\n**UPDATE EDIT:** I'm going to take a break from responding and I'll award a few deltas. A few thoughts:\n\n1. I understand that for people to make these environmentally friendly decisions like reducing air travel or meat consumption, we need systemic changes in order to prevent the poor from  disproportionately paying the cost of those changes. My issue is that I don't see the average person advocating to increase the price of meat while decreasing the cost of produce. I don't see the passion that people have going after private jets in a movement to make clothing more durable and sustainable. All the passion and activity I see is only directed at limited action that only affects a small # of people.\n2. The arguments most compelling to me were those that attributed people's actions r lack thereof to things other than a focus on the 1%.\n3. I regret including the anecdotal example. It detracted from the main point I was trying to make.\n4. I still believe that the average American lifestyle results in more than their fair share of carbon emissions. Even if I can't blame individuals for making certain consumer choices due to factors outside their control, I still object to the idea that I see frequently that people want to maintain the existing system for themselves and not advocate for a more environmentally friendly one, whether it's trying to get rid of gas stoves, beef, ICE cars, or cheap fashion.\n5. I promise I'm not a simp for 1%. Fuck over the 1% to your heart's content. I don't care. I just don't think that is enough.",

  "title": "CMV: The Presidents of Harvard, UPenn, and MIT said nothing wrong in that congressional hearing.",
  "selftext": "I've seen alot of people decry the testimony of the college presidents asking if calling for genocide of Jews would be against the harassment and bullying policy of their code of conduct. Their answer s were various flavors of \"it depends on context, if it was directed at a person, etc.\". Based of a reading the the relevant section of the code of conduct in question, that seems absolutely correct. From Harvard's for example.\n\n>Discriminatory harassment is unwelcome and offensive conduct that is based on an individual or group’s protected status. Discriminatory harassment may be considered to violate this policy when it is so severe or pervasive, and objectively offensive, that it creates a work, educational, or living environment that a reasonable person would consider intimidating, hostile, or abusive and denies the individual an equal opportunity to participate in the benefits of the workplace or the institution’s programs and activities.\n\nThese factors will be considered in assessing whether discriminatory harassment violates this policy:\n\n• Frequency of the conduct\n\n• Severity and pervasiveness of the conduct\n\n• Whether it is physically threatening\n\n• Degree to which the conduct interfered with an employee’s work performance or a student’s academic performance or ability to participate in or benefit from academic/campus programs and activities\n\n• The relationship between the alleged harasser and the subject or subjects of the harassment.\n\nIt's pretty clear one could imagine a student directly calling for genocide of a a given group(not that it actually has happened recently), and not breaking any of those rules as stated above. They're obvious horrible people for doing it, but as written, that part of the code of conduct can't be used to discipline them. \n\nIt's ironic that the right, the part of the political spectrum that's been critical of campuses for restricting speech, is now the one complaining about this the most.\n\nI've heard alot say is the question were asking about any other group(black, LGBT) , that they would have instantly answered \"Yes!\". I don't see any proof of that. Where are all the students being expelled from these schools for saying bad things about black people or LGBT? \n\nIn fact, UPenn's code of conduct EXPLICLITY points out that bigoted speech itself is not enough for a student to be disciplined.\n\n>To refrain from conduct towards other students that infringes upon the Rights of Student Citizenship. The University condemns hate speech, epithets, and racial, ethnic, sexual and religious slurs. However, the content of student speech or expression is not by itself a basis for disciplinary action. Student speech may be subject to discipline when it violates applicable laws or University regulations or policies.\n\nSo I basically don't really see anything they said as wrong, and considering that they were under oath I understand their desire to be precise in their answer. \n\nSo if you have any evidence of them not adhering their code of conduct, and expelling students for bigoted non-harrasment speech that could change my view.",

  "title": "CMV: There is a double standard with respect to age gaps",
  "selftext": "The socially acceptable age gap has narrowed in recent generations, mostly because of our improved understanding of the psychological dynamics of them. While it’s common to see married boomers and Gen Xers with 8-10 year age gaps, millennials and Gen Zs tend to see even a 4-5 year gap as too big to be normal, no matter the age. This is good, because while I can’t be bothered about how people live their lives, at least we’ve normalized close-in-age relationships and marriages. \n\nWhat bothers me though is the double standard when it comes to the genders involved. The stereotypical example is some trashy 19-20 year old with a 15-16 year old girlfriend. Society strongly frowns upon this and it can be illegal depending on the location or circumstances. Usually the guy in the relationship hasn’t had much success in dating, and also craves his youth back. The issue with that is that’s pretty much all he wants. The maturity gap is so big that there can’t possibly be a strong connection between them. The girl likewise usually craves something besides love too. She often craves adulthood. Her man will get her into adult circles and treat her like an adult. The problem is that she is NOT an adult and is basically getting her childhood stolen. These relationships hardly ever last, and breaking them off comes with the trauma of losing a big part of your childhood to a relationship in which you were being used.\n\nNow let’s pretend the girl is the one who’s 19-20. I see this all the time. A freshman or sophomore girl in college getting with a sophomore or junior boy in high school. The boy is 15-16. I think this is equally immoral because the wants are the same. The girl in this situation is usually craving the middle school/early high school cute romance back. She enjoys bringing her cutie boyfriend along with her to college/ adult social circles. He loves the affection he’s getting from not just her, but her friends. This is wrong, because again, it makes the boy grow up faster than he should. They’re with each other for the wrong reasons. She wants youth and a cutie patutie and he wants to get himself in the 20 year old social scene. But how do people react to this? The girls friends think it’s soo cute. And the boys friends are impressed that he’s with an older girl. Unlike the girl who got with an older guy, people don’t see the boy as having been used. They see him as accomplished. But the result is still the same, a chunk of childhood lost because of a relationship that is almost certain to fail statistically speaking. I can say from observation that there were countless high school guys at my school who were popular and had honors grades but that all fell apart once they got in the college party scene through older girlfriends.\n\n I have yet to see any rational reason why society views these two situations so differently. It’s more based on stereotypes than actual real life results.",

  "title": "CMV: AI Art is not inherently unethical.",
  "selftext": "I've seen a lot of backlash against AI-generated images/other art on social media, and while I can understand the criticisms I've seen, I don't agree with them. Working under the assumption that artificial image generation is ethically acceptable unless it can be reasoned that it isn't, here are some grievances about AI art I've seen and why I don't agree:\n\n* **AI image generators are stealing other people's work/copyrighted images.** This is a valid criticism of an image generator that takes a base image from the internet and modifies it, which is indeed how some of them work. That is akin to a human tracing art, or editing existing images. However, my understanding is that the higher quality image generators are simply trained on publicly available images, and generate their own pictures from scratch using what they've learned. This isn't stealing, in my view. It's akin to a human artist looking at other pictures for reference, then creating their own.\n* **AI art is taking away opportunities for commissions from human artists.** With how good artificial image generators have gotten, and with how good they will likely become in the future, it's clear that they are an appealing tool for anyone who wants to create a picture of anything with little cost or effort. Naturally, this could conceivably reduce the demand for artists creating pictures for graphics, thumbnails, viewing enjoyment, and so on. However, as unfortunate as that might be for affected artists, it doesn't mean that the engineers behind AI image generators or the people who use them are doing anything wrong. Sometimes technological advancement just reduces the demand for doing things the old fashioned way. You're allowed to introduce a new product that competes with an existing industry. For example, [Taxi drivers have objected to the rise of ride-sharing services like Uber](https://www.thethings.com/stephen-colberts-guest-travis-kalanick-was-rattled-after-hecklers-angrily-interrupted-his-interview/) for how it's affected their industry in the past, but that doesn't mean ride-sharing apps are unethical.\n* **People can falsely claim to have created artwork when they are actually just showing what they generated with AI.** The issue here is that the hypothetical individual is lying, not that they are using an AI image generator. Yes, artificially generated images have become very well refined and can't always be distinguished from something that is human-made, but that isn't an inherently bad thing. Obviously falsely claiming to have made something you didn't is plagiarism, but we aren't going to start calling Wikipedia unethical because someone could copy-paste it and claim it's their own work.\n* **AI can be used to create likenesses of real people in inappropriate situations or for otherwise deceptive purposes without their consent.** This is an issue with a potential use for the technology, not the technology itself. I don't consider AI-generated visuals/audio to be unethical as a whole simply because they could potentially be abused. The internet can be (and is) abused for some truly heinous things, but that doesn't mean the internet itself is a bad thing.\n\nOverall, I see how controversial this developing technology has become, but I think the main criticisms don't really hold up to scrutiny. I would be interested in reading what people who oppose AI art have to say about this, since I don't think I've personally ever really seen an in-depth discussion of the points I'm making here. I'm sure it's happened, but I would like to see for myself.",

  "selftext": "I want to preface this by saying, I do not support Israel, or Hamas. Im also an atheist, and I have absolutely no issue against Jews or Muslims, and I consider myself central on the political compass. This post is not politically, religiously or racially charged. This also has nothing to do with the actual countries of Palestine and Israel themselves, I’m referring to the people you see online who live in western countries, who spam every social media comment section with “Free Palestine”, have Palestinian flag profile pictures and March in the streets for a Ceasefire in Palestine. The ones who’ll comment “How can you focus on this when there’s genocide in Gaza right now!”.\n\nMy view is that ,generally speaking, these people don’t actually care all that much about raising awareness for armed conflict and the devastation it leaves for the civilians. I’m not saying all of them, just generally speaking. Atleast 50% anyway. I think that they are jumping on the bandwagon because showing support for Palestine is trendy right now, and it’s “the thing to do” right now to show that you’re a morally sound person, that you care for the little guy and what not.\n\nI think this, because there are literally more armed Conflicts than I could count all across the planet, happening right now, with many of these armed conflicts (especially in Africa), having far higher death tolls, cruelty, destruction and impacted/displaced civilians, that have been going on longer than the current Israel vs Palestine war, and yet there has been absolutely ZERO mention or “awareness raisers” from anyone anywhere online about them. I mean, these “Free Palestine” people claim to care about the innocent children impacted by war, but seemingly they only care about the children when they’re Palestinian, because currently, Sudan is the biggest child displacement crisis in the world right now caused by war, with over 3 million children from Sudan fleeing their country because of the war. And yet, have you ever seen a “Free Sudan” comment? There are currently over 40 million forcibly displaced civilians from armed conflicts across the continent of Africa. \n\nTo put it into perspective, currently the amount of armed conflicts all around the world sits at:\n\n-Middle East and North Africa, 45 Armed conflicts \n- Africa, 35+ Armed conflicts\n-Asia, 21 Armed Conflicts \n-Europe, 7 Armed Conflicts\n-Latin America, 6 Armed Conlficts\n\n[(Source)](https://geneva-academy.ch/galleries/today-s-armed-conflicts#)\n\n\nNow out of this LARGE selection of armed conflicts to chose from to raise awareness for, to spam it in comment sections to prove to the world that they are a morally sound person, they all happen to chose this one conflict that isn’t the biggest conflict, not the bloodiest conflict, not the cruelest conflict, not the most destructive conflict, not the highest death toll conflict, not the conflict with the most impacted civilians, not the most needless ill-founded conflict out there, not the conflict with the biggest impact to children, not the biggest humanitarian crisis. \n\nNo, they for some reason, seem to only care about the conflict in Palestine, but they do this, whilst claiming their moral superiority over you for being more aware about wars and humanitarian crises. And mysteriously, a good amount of these people prior to the Israel vs Palestine conflict, never posted/commented/raised awareness about any of these other conflicts, so I can’t even pin this down to their attention just being solely preoccupied by this conflict and that they would’ve been doing the same for a different conflict if this wasn’t happening. \n\nI genuinely believe that, certainly not all, but a good amount, probably the vast majority of them, have only jumped on the Palestine bandwagon, because it’s the trendy thing to do right now and that they do it to feel good about themselves for establishing their moral superiority over people. My view is, a load of them are in it for the trend, not because they genuinely REALLY care about raising awareness for those impacted by war, because if they genuinely did care about that, then you’d see these people talking about other armed conflicts too, god forbid maybe even ones that aren’t viral on tik tok.\n\nSo that’s my view, is there something I’ve massively overlooked? I am open minded, and if someone comes along with a genuinely good counter view, maybe you’ll change my mind!\n\nAnd again, this is NOT a politically, religiously or racially charged post and viewpoint. I do not support Israel or Hamas, and I am central on the political compass. The war between the two is undoubtedly, a needless waste of life and a big humanitarian crisis. I don’t want to come across as a Zionist red pill freak, an accusation commonly thrown at anyone who doesn’t make their whole life about Palestine.",

  "title": "CMV: Misgendering a trans criminal is akin to referring to a black criminal by a racial slur",
  "selftext": "**WARNING: This post discusses sex crimes, transphobia, and racism.**\n\n----\n\n**Context:**\n\nRecently there has been a prominent news story in the UK regarding someone charged with committing sexual abuse. I'll omit the names here, albeit they can be found with a quick Google search - the specifics are not relevant to my view; although this news story is what prompted me to think about this. It goes without saying, I condemn these crimes entirely.\n\nThe accused identifies as a trans-woman, however mainstream media organizations (e.g. Sky News) are primarily referring to them as he/him and their dead (male) name. This is not a reporting error, the news stories specifically reference that they do not identify by that name. For the purpose of this discussion I would like to focus on the case where it was intentional.\n\n**My View:**\n\nI am a firm ally of the trans community, and in general I consider it very disrespectful to refer to someone in a way they do not wish to be referred to. It's not that I feel an abuser is deserving of respect, but that intentionally misgendering them is disrespectful to trans people as a whole.\n\nThis is where the analogy drawn in the title comes in. I realize this is essentially a \"double standard\" argument which isn't so precise. If the criminal had been a person of color I would have been shocked to hear a news anchor refer to them as by a racial slur. I would consider this as disrespectful to people of that ethnicity as a whole.\n\nAs a reader of these new articles, the intentional misgendering of the criminal causes me two concerns:\n\n1. The author may intend for the reader to conclude some causal link between sex abuse crimes and being transgender. This is additionally problematic given the long and difficult history of the media insinuating that LGBT people are more likely to be sex criminals. \n\n2. The author, and by extension the media organization, holds contempt for transgender people in general.\n\n**Weakness in my view:**\n\nWhile I feel that my analogy is strong, when it comes to the nature of the situations, the degree of them may be inequal. Perhaps it is more widely held that racial slurs are worse than purposefully misgendering someone, and that misgendering is not severe enough to be considered inappropriate language for a news organization. Personally I do not feel this way, and view both as very disrespectful.\n\nThanks for reading, the nature of these crimes makes this discussion quite controversial.\n\n----\n\nEdit:\n\nSky News have frequently referred to other trans people, e.g. Eliot Page, by their preferred pronouns. To me this is evidence of an intentional choice to show less respect to alleged criminals by deliberately misgendering them.\n\n----\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI stand by my previous choice to not acknowledge the article that prompted this thought. Many comments are asking for it, but I don't think deconstructing a specific article is going to be constructive here. My opinion is very general, in that I feel that deliberately misgendering a trans criminal, especially in a news article, is harmful/disrespectful to trans people in general.\n\nThere are many many replies in such a short period of time. Many of them are more broadly arguing the legitimacy of preferred pronouns and offense caused by misgendering as a whole. I personally do not find this very convincing.",

It treats the woman like a piece of property, like she \"belongs\" to the father,  and is being handed over to the would-be husband.\n\nIt is also completely toxic and manipulative if any partner springs a marriage proposal on their partner without first having discussed the idea of marriage at length. They should know their partner's stance on marriage. If they spring a public proposal on them without knowing where they stand, it has the potential to manipulate the partner into saying \"yes\" just because of the public pressure and expectation that they will say yes. If they say \"no\", then the partner deserves to be humiliated because they were trying to pressure their partner into something they didn't want.",

  "selftext": "US per capita CO2 emissions are something like 15 tons per year, one of the highest rates in the world. For comparison Costa Rica's per capita emissions are 1.62 tons/yr. \n\nA [fairly new paper in Nature found](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01132-6) that 1.2 average Americans emit enough carbon over their lives (~1,200 tons) to essentially make where one person lives uninhabitable, I am paraphrasing the paper but it is incredibly bleak. The worst impacts will be in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, where famine, drought, and unsurvivable heat waves are likely. \n\nIt's easy to see why US emissions are so high, I'm an American, grew up in a suburb, and our infrastructure is absurdly car-dependent, public transit is abysmal, and cross-country and international flights are very common. Not to mention the high rates of beef consumption and disposable plastic use. Also, many suburban Americans drive huge SUVs and lifted trucks, even though they work office jobs, seeming to not care about the unnecessary fuel costs. This is even with knowledge of climate change and environmental problems being widespread for over 40 years.\n\nI don't think the individual US resident had much to do with setting up the country the way it is, but I also don't see bad infrastructure as an excuse to continue engaging in hugely polluting activities. To me, it almost doesn't matter how inconvenient it is, I have to do the right thing, even if everyone around me is behaving poorly. Personally, I'm never taking a plane vacation again, because I see this as harming others unnecessarily. You could even measure the impact of a plane trip in terms of the amount of time it subtracts from an average South Asian child (for example) having a habitable climate, if my napkin math is right, a round-trip from NYC to Paris (2 tons CO2 equivalent) is shaving off over a month. Just from one vacation! Now think of a frequent flyer or cruise family.\n\nThere are two main responses I see to this line of argument. First, shifting responsibility onto corporations, governments, or the super wealthy with private jets. I completely agree that these are all terrible actors, and political action like abolishing the fossil fuel industry is required. I'm involved in local politics and activism, and I think everyone should be. But that still doesn't put the average Joe in the clear. One of the statistics frequently cited is that 100 corporations are responsible for 71% of carbon emissions. While this is true, I often see it used to excuse polluting behavior, and I think that's a misinterpretation. Those 100 corporations are fossil fuel corporations, who indeed burn fossil fuels to extract more fossil fuels, but they do that to sell their products to us, the consumers. [Residential electricity and personal vehicles are huge chunks of US emissions.](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#direct-industrial-processes-5-2) I think part of what makes the fossil fuel companies so evil is that they successfully convinced Americans to have massively polluting lifestyles through marketing and lies! \n\nThe other response is that it's hopeless, individual action won't do anything because civilization is already doomed. This response is harder to argue against because it may be true, but regardless, us being screwed still doesn't make it ok to do morally wrong things, and this kind of thinking will only hasten our demise, and the demise of those less fortunate than us.",

I also have not heard an argument against it that holds up against the most basic research.\n\nI have heard about what a small percentage of the atmosphere is actually CO2, which is like saying trains cant possibly move because only a small percentage of the train's mass is being ignited.\n\nI have heard all of the variants of \"humans only contribute [small number] of the carbon in the atmosphere\" or any and all variants of obscuring the difference between carbon flux and accumulated carbon.\n\nI have heard about how in the late cretaceous or on some other geological timescale the earth used to be warmer than it is now. Thats not very compelling.\n\nI have heard people say that more CO2 means more trees to soak up CO2, as though trees and humans are the only things that have any kind of feedback loop with carbon in the atmosphere. As the earth warms, some things will absorb more, some will emit more, some will absorb less, et cetera. Trees have a finite amount of places they can grow and we aint doin the algae any favors either.\n\nI have also heard that geologists and climatologists are all liars who are faking it.

  "title": "cmv: Jordan Peterson is wrong about climate change.",
  "selftext": "I'm going to use his most (I think) widely sited argument against the current consensus on the issue of climate change. He makes many arguments, some not even consistent with others, but I'll leave it at one that seems to stick. It goes something like this:\n\nWe shouldn't transition to cleaner sources of energy or follow the current global action plans because it will hurt poor people and cause suffering, famine and/or death on a wide scale and the solution would be to (paraphrasing here) drill our way out of the situation by attempting to bring as many of the globally relative poor out of poverty as fast as possible via fossil fuels because psychologically, they would begin to care more, therefore taking action to solve the issue by means of the free market. \n\nI think there are almost too many issues with this to address all at once. Why assume that anybody plans on people starving to solve the issue? Can we not solve or at least attempt to solve both issues at once? Does he really believe the people who are working on this think we should have to sacrifice people to save the world? I don't think this is a zero-sum thing.   This is all aside from the point that he is affiliated with a right-wing media outlet partially (initially at least) funded by fossil fuel billionaires. \n\nThis issue is derived from free market activity, and it is in all of our interests to address this issue, but the power/behavior dynamic of the individual consumer and the corporation is completely skewed.\n\n I'll admit my bias will show here, my understanding is that corporations despite having the same long term interests of everything not falling apart, look too short term in their goals and many industries such as natural gas/oil/coal have little to no independant short term incentive to stop or make cleaner the things they produce for profit. As an investor in public equity, it seems like maximizing shareholder value is and always will be the number one priority aside from some government intervention. \n\nA whole other issue is the idea that relative wealth inequality would ever get better by giving these already established conglomerates free reign to get away with anything they wanted. It may create and spur some middle-class activities for sure, but largely things would remain the same. The already advantaged will squeeze the profits, and it will not be equitably distributed in third world countries. \n\nAnother thing weird about this and JP is that he specifically defends the status quo on income inequality. Even if he's right, that the global poor would begin to care more if they held a better wealth base and quality of life, he has made IQ and hierarchical pareto distribution based arguments to fight against any change in the current distribution of wealth, his arguments seem to suggest that the free market is as fair and merit based as its ever going to get, and that it would be immoral for the working class to own a higher share of the global wealth.  \n\nThese things alone seem like enough to disregard this specific argument. He doesn't seem to actually care about workers' rights or income inequality. Or climate science. \n\nA quick view of the the arguments ranging from more carbon actually being good, to the models being wrong and to us not even having a definition of \"climate\" seems to all point to him not really caring at all one way or another. I speculate this has to do with being pulled into the conservative media sphere where there is a lot of good money in keeping things status quo yet not being unappealing by just being honest that the conservative view of climate change is not out of concern of majority of people, but of profits for the few.\n\nEdit for links \n\nhttps://youtu.be/eDWq7-eP5sE?si=8Dw8pLZt8MRvsbJT\n\nhttps://youtu.be/z0G5aSGWhaI?si=oIxaX3PRXTMdjRsa\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7yYn-ATFF-k?si=HBflfQ3NBKuvfnoX\n",

  "selftext": "New York doesn’t offer much for the price tag, and certainly not much of anything exclusive to NYC — you’ll have people from 900 different places, endless variety of overpriced foreign cuisines, and the most commercially successful people around you, but an educated white-collar worker will waste a lifetime trying to build something sustainable here, lured by false promises. You can find the things here at other cities, living as a normal person and more enjoyably so.\n\nSeriously, you need to rake in $120,000 AFTER taxes just to scrape by, and that's setting the bar low. The weight of value-added tax, city tax, and state tax crush any hope of financial stability and security for the future. The dream of having three kids and a cozy home? Comfortable retirement in the city? Yeah, that's more like an unattainable fantasy.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on housing costs. They devour over half of your yearly income, leaving you cramped in these claustrophobic spaces that barely pass as a room. You can forget about finding peace and solace there. Noise pollution infiltrates every nook and cranny, robbing you of a clean, safe, and warm sanctuary to call home.\n\nFood hype in this city: It's baffling to see people going gaga over overpriced restaurants. Personally, I'd rather whip up a healthy meal in the comfort of my own kitchen. I mean, seriously, what's the obsession with eating out all the time? Does a city really need 800 flavors of rice you can splurge on every day to make you decide to live here?\n\nAnd don't even get me started on grocery shopping. Buying healthy food here costs $$$$. And to top it off, forget the convenience of loading up your car with groceries like a normal person. No, no, you get the privilege of waiting outside a Whole Foods for half an hour and trying to carry what you can through the subway.\n\nSpeaking of which, let’s not sugarcoat it—the subway system is a hot mess. It's dirty, dangerous, and you're guaranteed encounters with homeless folks, drug addicts, and downright dangerous individuals EVERY TIME you ride it. Harassment and assault become part of your daily commute, making minding your own business feel like a Herculean task. I had to commute through the 7 and 6 trains going up to the Bronx to go to college, and each stop going North gets worse and worse with weirder people boarding.\n\nThe irony: Ridership is 40% lower than what it used to be pre-COVID. Why? The animals on the subway system are fucking maniacs, killing and assaulting normal people, so people don’t want to do it. Our DA got the job because he promised not to prosecute people. To solve the subway’s money bleeding problem, instead of addressing crime, they decided to bring a $23 toll just to enter a goddamn street with a car: So let’s just tax people instead of cleaning up the mess to make up for the MTA’s money drain brought about by corrupt and malicious politicians not cleaning up crime. If you can’t afford the tax, endanger yourself! 🗽\n\nLet’s talk about the \"hot spots\" in Manhattan. What's there to do on a regular night for a regular guy? Oh, right, be some alcoholic drunkard at a bar, stuff your face at overpriced joints, or wait in never-ending lines just to get into an overcrowded nightclub. How is that a vibrant social scene?\n\nAnd those tourist attractions they rave about—museums, Broadway shows, and such—don't even get me started. Who has the time and money to go to them every single week? Yeah, I know, free passes for some, blablabla, but there aren’t 1000 different museums so let’s not pretend it’s an otherworldly new experience each time. Living outside the city and visiting them occasionally makes way more sense. Yet, the cost of indulging in these activities adds to the already overwhelming financial strain.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the precious commodity called free time. The average worker in this city hardly has any of it to spare! You grind your way from 8 AM to 6 PM, desperately trying to make ends meet. And what do you get in return? Two hours to grab some food, either wasting time dining out or wasting money on unhealthy bodega junk. Or you drink until 1 AM, then repeat the same shit at 6 AM.\n\nDoesn't it sound like a dream come true? The monotony, the lack of time, the perpetual exhaustion—it's like living in a twisted reality where you're constantly chasing your own tail.\n\nLet's not forget Manhattan itself. It's becoming just a sea of chain restaurants and stores. Sketchers, McDonald's, Starbucks—you name it—all the same suburban crap but with outrageous price tags. You used to be able to find niche places that only existed within the depths, but it’s rapidly becoming the town square of some town in Illinois.\n\nIf you dare to escape to upstate or hit the beach, get ready for more train rides accompanied by the unsettling presence of creepy and dangerous homeless individuals. Oh, and now you have to rent a car, which translates to even more hard-earned cash down the drain.\n\nHonestly, the argument that the average white-collar worker will enjoy a good life in this city is laughable. The financial burdens, suffocating living spaces, hazardous transportation, and mind-boggling costs for basic needs and leisure activities make any sense of comfort and well-being seem like a distant dream. Other big cities in this country don’t really lack much of any of the good things NYC offers.",

Some malicious allegations could be avoided by making specific efforts to not piss women off, but that does little for, say, a situation where a woman falsely claims rape because she doesn't want her parents to know she consented to sex.\n\nMistaken allegations provide for more avenues of protection for men, but at some point you just have to take your partner at their word that they are consenting to the sex and are consenting for the right reasons.  So \"repeatedly checking in and reading body language\" is really the best protection for men attempting to avoid mistaken false allegations.\n\nBut if your partner is telling you that they want to have sex (either with words or actions), when they really don't want to have sex, what is a man to do?  It's reasonable to take her at her word, but you never really know if she's consenting because she wants sex, or if it's because she is afraid of what you'll do if she says no, or because she had a couple glasses of wine, or because she thinks it means you'll be her boyfriend.  And if it turns out to be some reason *other* than that she actually wanted to have sex, the man is at risk of being falsely accused.\n\nNote that the examples I provided above as protections a man can take to avoid false rape allegations fall within the \"little\" a man can do.  So responses of \"look at your own post, there are lots of things a man can do\" won't sway my opinion.\n\n**EDIT #1**:  Several top-level responses have boiled down to \"false accusations aren't worth worrying about\".  Those responses do no challenge my view and I've reported them to the moderators.  I don't know whether the mods will remove them as a Rule #1 violation or not, but since they don't challenge my view, I won't be responding to them.",

  "title": "CMV: Free Will Doesn't Exist",
  "selftext": "Okay, so I'm going to condense a few very weighty arguments down to a relatively condensed bit of text. Likewise, I am assuming a certain level of understanding of the classical arguments for determinism and will not be explaining them to a high level of depth.\n\n**Laplace's Daemon**  \n\nIn this argument, mathematician and physicist Simon Laplace said to imagine a Daemon. This Daemon is a hypothetical entity or intelligence with complete knowledge of the positions and velocities of all particles in the universe, as well as a perfect understanding of the physical laws governing their behavior. With this complete knowledge, the Daemon could predict the future and retrodict the past with absolute certainty. In other words, if you knew the initial conditions of the universe and had a perfect understanding of the laws of physics, you could, in theory, calculate the past and future of the entire universe.\n\n**Argument From Physics**  \n\nThe sum total of physical energy in the world is a constant, subject to transformation from one form to another but not subject either to increase or diminution. This means that any movement of any body is entirely explicable in terms of antecedent physical conditions. Therefore the deeds of the human body are mechanically caused by preceding conditions of body and brain, without any reference whatsoever to the metaphysical mind of the individual, to his intents and purposes. This means that the will of man is not one of the contributing causes to his action; that his action is physically determined in all respects. If a state of will, which is mental, caused an act of the body, which is physical, by so much would the physical energy of the world be increased, which is contrary to the hypothesis universally adopted by physicists. Hence, to physics, the will of man is not a vera causa in explaining physical movement.\n\n**Argument from Biology**\n\nAny creature is a compound of capacities and reactions to stimuli. The capacities it receives from heredity, the stimuli come from the environment. The responses referable to the mentality of the animal are the effects of inherited tendencies on the one hand and of the stimuli of the environment on the other hand. This explanation is adequately accepted in reference to all but humans. Humans are adequately similar in biology to other primates, particularly chimpanzees. Therefore the explanation also works for humans, absent an empirical reason to exclude them. Therefore human behaviour is entirely explicable through materialistic causes.\n\n\\---\n\n**The Uncertainty Principle and Laplace's Daemon**\n\nNow you might be thinking that Laplace's Daemon is refuted by the HUP, and you would be right to bring up the Uncertainty Principle in this regard. However, it is not enough that Laplace's Daemon be refuted to prove Free Will since Quantum Processes logically predate humanity. Simply put, Quantum Processes are not a human construct and therefore, since empirical evidence suggest they exist, it must follow that they predate humanity. If they predate humanity, then the variable that determines the outcome of the wave function must be independent of human influence, else the Quantum Processes could not have predated humanity. Therefore, we can logically assume that apparent indeterminism is a function of incompleteness.\n\n\\---\n\nI don't know if I can be convinced that free will necessarily exists (I hope I could be, the alternative is terrifying) but I do believe I can be swayed away from strict determinism.",

  "title": "CMV: Americans are missing valuable financial advice from older generations",
  "selftext": "I see the avocado toast meme referenced for basically every piece of financial advice or caution from older people, the older they are the more disregarded their financial opinion is. I think many Americans simply don't understand how much of a consumption driven culture the US really has become and how they have never actually lived with true scarcity or *real* poverty. \n\nMy mom and grandmother always used to tell me stories about how in the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's people would save a lot of stuff that would be considered completely useless now. My grandparents and their neighbors would save all kinds of things like old containers, broken electronics, broken furniture, ect. They would fix up old furniture instead of buying new, they would use an old whip cream container to store their screws and bolts instead of a $70 Milwaukee bag, and they would make an honest effort to fix what was broken and to save money where they could. This was during what many would describe to be a better economic environment. They had a real fear of scarcity and not being prepared for something unpredictable. Today it seems like so many people have nice stuff but $0 in cash. \n\nPeople in the US since WW2 have largely been unscathed by the worlds conflict and although there were some economic downturns, the US remained comparatively stable to most of the rest of the world. I think that's one of the main points here, that most of the world is in a worse economic position, has access to less cheap goods, and has less of an ability to make something of themselves. I feel like this is lost on many American's today. It seems that many believe that the US is actually poor and the rest of the world is killing it which couldn't be farther from the truth.\n\nTo me, the boomer avocado toast advice stands for being frugal and making financial sacrifices. Many people won't even consider a financial sacrifice like buying a $25,000 SUV instead of a $50,000, even if that means living paycheck to paycheck. American's have a total of 1.08 Trillion in CC debt. How much of that do you think was spent on necessities? Probably not as much as you would think. And yes, obviously there are still frugal people left who save stuff and repurpose it and don't care at all about appearances. In my experience though I listen to people living above their means, making regular wasteful purchases, bitching non stop about how shitty the US is because they're not driving a Porsche. ",

  "title": "cmv: Israel is not a \"settler-colonialist\" state.",
  "selftext": "I first want to point out that I think that Israel's actions in Gaza are indefensible and should be condemned. I think an immediate ceasefire is needed and I deeply sympathise with the plight of innocent Palestinian civilians (likewise, I was horrified by Hamas' attacks on innocent Israeli civilians). This is a conflict in which Israel clearly has the superior power and military capability to act as an oppressor, and has illegally occupied the Palestinian territories and breached Palestinians human rights on countless occasions.\n\nHowever, I keep seeing claims that the founding of Israel must be understood as a \"settler-colonial\" project sustained by the 'settler-colonial' ideology of Zionism. I have three problems with this reading of history, although I am open to be convinced otherwise:\n\n1. Firstly, every single settler colony throughout history has been controlled by an imperial authority, a 'metropole' which exploits land, resources, labour, human beings, and geopolitical influence from their colonies on the periphery. Israel was not settled by an imperialist state and organised military, but by a minority group from many different countries, who did not set out to further the economic interests of those countries but to start a new life for themselves. Most Jews who came to Palestine during the first and second aliyot were refugees fleeing persecution, as were the many who fled from Nazi persecution and the Holocaust. Surely this is a fundamental difference between Zionism and (for example) British settler colonialism in North America and Australia. It seems to me that the motivations of Zionist Jews in Eastern Europe had very little in common with British capitalists sought new markets for their goods or resources to extract.\n2. Secondly, every single settler-colony throughout history has seized land through violent warfare and maintained it through force. Whilst this has been true of Israel since 1948,  early Jewish settlers bought land legally by purchasing it from absentee landlords. Early Zionism was not built around the violent annexation of territory, but immigration and land purchase. The conflict leading up to the UN separation of Palestine was at least partly the result of Muslim Palestinian nationalists who opposed the non-violent settlement and purchase of land by Jews (many of them refugees). On the other hand, both the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine resisted and fought against *British* Imperialism. This seems like a very different process from (for example) the early United States wars against Native Americans, forced displacements and military-backed colonisation of the frontier.\n3. Thirdly, settler-colonies seek the forced removal or extermination of the home population. I think it is clear that Zionism was not originally a project to remove the local population from Palestine, even if Zionists ignored and minimalised the question of what they would do if Palestinians rejected their vision. At many Zionist conferences they affirmed the need for unity and their desire for both Jews and Arabs to flourish in the new state. More often, it seems leading Zionists like Herzl held that Arabs would benefit from Jewish immigration to the area and the economic resources that European Jews would bring. Even Ze'ev Jabotinsky said in 1931 that \"We don’t want to evict one Arab from the left or right banks of the Jordan.” The minority of Zionists who rejected the Peel Commission did so because they wanted a united Palestine, not because they wanted to forcibly remove Arabs from the Arab areas. After 1948, this is a different story, but I don't think the ramifications of that war are best seen as an integral part of a pre-meditated plan of ethnic cleansing baked into the 'settler-colonist ideology' of Zionism.\n\nFor these reasons, if Israel is a 'settler-colony', it is a settler-colony *sui generis,* unlike any settler-colony in the history of the world. This doesn't justify Israel's actions, but I think it is important to understand when thinking about the history of the conflict.\n\nThe French Marxist Maxime Rodinson, who was the first to call Israel a settler-colonial state, argued that if the 1947 United Nations partition plan had been adhered to, settler-colonialism 'could have been left behind'. But if Israel was never a settler-colonial state in the first place, then its actions since 1947 need to be understood in a different light. I think there are some important differences between the current actions of the Israeli government and the settlement of the West Bank by an aggressive and heavily militarized state and the history of Jewish immigration to Palestine under the Ottoman and British Empires.",

  "selftext": "I believe that the ownership of firearms in the hands of citizens is good and should be promoted. Specifically, while gun restrictions should be uplifted, we should still use background checks. A general policy of education about gun safety should also be promoted in conjunction with the encouragement of ownership.\n\nThe promotion is not that of a mandate or thinly-vieled request, but more in line with the encouragement and acknowledgement of freedom of speech or other rights citizens have.\n\nBelow are things I believe about gun ownership which relate to the title of the post.\n\nGuns are often popular in rural areas due to the lifestyle among objectively good reasons. These being to facilitate hunting, protection from wild animals or criminals as police response time is notoriously slow in those regions.\n\nGuns let people defend themselves with the ultimate equalizer. People who cannot defend themselves when up against a strong attacker can rely on a gun.\n\nHaving guns in the hands of the public will also help victims of unjust government. The Black Panther Party did just this to protect their community from the police which harresed them. There have been many instances where communities having guns could help deter, or if it came to, fight back against their attackers. \n\nFurther back into history, we can see what happened to groups of people such as the native Americans which disarmed themselves, becoming slaughtered with no way reasonably defend themselves. In Appalachia, exploited and strictly enforced workers rose up in the Battle Of Blaire Mountain which was only possible as the workers were sufficiently armed to do so.\n\nAnyone who promotes freedom and liberty but denies people the right to bear arms are stupid at best, hypocrites at worst.\n\nCriminals and crime organizations will still exist and continue with their illicit operations but we can hope that an armed society will atleast decrease violent crime. Your average criminal wouldn't want to risk their lives and it would deter more crime.\n\nExtremists or hate groups would be more careful if their victims could defend themselves. Neo-Nazis and the KKK should be afraid to walk out their house bearing their symbols in fear of being shot as they are nothing but a threat to their community and nation at large. When the people who would want you dead are armed and willing to kill you, it only makes sense to arm yourself as well.\n\nIn a authoritarian nation, an armed populace is the last thing they want. It doesn't matter how many tanks, jets, drones, or warships they have, none of those stand on street corners enforcing no assembly edicts or knocking down doors checking for contraband. Only police or soldiers can do that, and when every homeowner potentially has a rifle and every person walking down the street could have a pistol in their waistband, it becomes a nightmare to even attempt to subjugate the populace.\n\nWhile idealistic in nature, the US constitution allowing citizens the right to bear arms with the explicit purpose of safeguarding tyranny should be strived towards.\n\nThere have been instances in which a mass shooting was stopped by an armed citizen, someone already on the scene and able to stop the threat before they kill a large amount of innocent people. Police can take minutes to arrive on the scene, and even longer to actually deal with the threat.\n\nWhile mass shootings are abhorrent tragedies, we must remember that people who are willing to walk into a school or place of worship and slaughter people are too far gone and will get their hands on guns or weapons. Guns can be stolen, fabricated, or 3D-printed.\n\nI feel that a major point of contention in the United States about gun rights is how much fanaticism and death we see about it. We see insane people online claiming to kill innocents or those we hate and those who make guns part of their personality. We hear about major mass shootings all the time.\n\nI apologize if what I listed above is rather formless.",

Look at r/blackpeopletwitter now. There ain’t no solidarity with the people of Israel after Hamas raped, slaughtered and tortured over a thousand men, women and children. The general mood of the sub, and you can see this just by searching keywords such as ‘Israel’, ‘Jews’ and ‘Hamas’, can be summed up as “sucks to suck. the jews had it coming”. There’s posts over there with thousands of upvotes showing screenshots of twitter where people are saying “What did you think decolonization meant lol? Peaceful protest forever?”, there’s posts with screenshots criticizing the perceived overabundance of sympathy for Israel in America after the attack and that this “clown ass country”, which was the title of the post, was afraid to criticize the alleged “genocide” of the Palestinian people. \n\nThere are verified users in the “country club threads” saying vile stuff about the IDF and the Israeli people, here’s some direct quotes from one. \n\n> Israeli soldiers are literally thugs and concentration camp guards lol\n\n> they’re engaging in a colonial and white supremacist project \n\nThey’re un-ironically hiding behind the “ANTI-ZIONISM DOES NOT EQUAL ANTI-SEMITISM” defense. Even though without a Zion for Israelites, and this attack proves it, there’s no place where they can be reliably safe from persecution and violence. There was a recent Vox article that made a somewhat passable attempt to explore the topic but the main thrust of the argument was “LOL black people don’t owe jews shit. Get over yourselves and stop thirsting for black people to help validate your cause” which is not only arrogant and self centered but also completely lacking in self awareness. When jews are asking for black people to stand with them, they’re asking not because they want the “black seal” of approval to know their social justice movement is “real”, but because black and white activists actively shamed and cudgeled people who stood on the sidelines during the George Floyd protests instead of advocating for BLM and police reform. \n\n“Silence is violence” right? Until the people are white I guess. \n\nI suppose this shouldn’t be too surprising when you consider the rabidly anti-semitic views pushed by Elijah Muhammed, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam more broadly. Now I fully acknowledge that they NOI served vital needs in the black community in the 60’s and 70’s. They offered dignity, self respect, mutual aid in times of trouble and a framework in which black men and women could understand themselves and their place in an extremely racist society. \n\nBut they were also anti-semitic af. And the people that subscribed to those views are still alive today and their views were passed down to their kids and grandkids. Same as racism. It’s why you see little bubbles of anti-semitism pop up here and there like Jay-Z’s line about Jews owning all property in America off his latest album 4:44, actually Jay has a few questionable lines about jews in his discography.

If she decides to abort the baby its \"her body her choice\" but if she decides to keep it then its \"he should have thought about this beforehand\". Where is the accountability on the woman's side? How is it fair that the woman gets to opt out of parenthood at will, but the man has no say. How can you blame fathers who suddenly turn into the milkman if they didn't want the baby in the first place?\n\nI think we should still give the woman the deciding vote on whether to keep the baby but there should be a legal option for all men to opt out of fatherhood before the birth.\n\nEdit: As one of the commenters said, this is not an anti-abortion post or a post claiming pregnancy is not one of the hardest things a person can go through, this is simply about men's rights",

  "title": "META: Transgender Topics",
  "selftext": "# The Rule Change\n\nBeginning immediately, r/changemyview will no longer allow posts related to transgender topics. The reasons for this decision will follow. This decision has not been made lightly by the administration of this subreddit, and has been the topic of months of discussion.\n\n# Background\n\nOver the past 8 months, r/changemyview has been inundated with posts related to transgender topics. I conducted a survey of these posts, and more than 80% of them ended up removed under Rule B. More importantly, a very large proportion of these threads were ultimately removed by Reddit's administrators. This would not be a problem if the topic was an infrequent one. However, for some periods, we have had between 4 and 8 new posts on transgender-related issues per day. Many days, they have made up more than 50% of the topics of discussion in this subreddit.\n\n# Reasoning\n\nIf a post is removed by Reddit or by the moderators of this subreddit under B, we consider the thread a failure. Views have not been changed. Lots of people have spent a lot of time researching and making reasoned arguments in favor of or against a position. If the thread is removed, that effort is ultimately wasted. We respect our commenters too much to allow this to continue.\n\nFurthermore, this subreddit was founded to change views on a wide variety of subjects. When a single topic of discussion so overwhelms the subreddit that other topics cannot be easily discussed, that goal is impeded. This is, to my knowledge, only the second time that a topic has become so prevalent as to require this drastic intervention. However, this is not r/changemytransview. This is r/changemyview. If you are interested in reading arguments related to transgender topics, we truly have a thorough and complete treatment of the topic in this subreddit's history.\n\n# The Rule\n\nPursuant to Rule D, any thread that touches on transgender issues, even tangentially, will be removed by the automoderator. Attempts to circumvent automoderation will not be treated lightly by the moderation team, as they are indicative of a disdain for our rules. If you don't know enough to avoid the topic and violate our rules, that's not that big of a deal. If you know enough to try to evade the automoderator, that shows a deliberate intent to thwart our rules. Please do not attempt to avoid this rule.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe moderation team regrets deeply that this decision has been necessary. We will answer any questions in this thread, or in r/ideasforcmv. We will not entertain discussion of this policy in unrelated topics. We will not grant exceptions to this rule. We may revisit this rule if circumstances change. We are unlikely to revisit this rule for at least six months.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe moderators of r/changemyview",

  "selftext": "I've seen it so many times on so many posts about pregnant women. They behave negatively towards their spouse and those around them, they engage in behaviors they would have avoided before. So many people are quick to support them, saying things like they can't control their hormones, you don't know what it's like, you should be supportive no matter what, etc. I don't see why we should allow negative behavior as a result of hormones.\n\nMen are genetically more aggressive due to the higher amounts of testosterone in our system. We have a genetic proclivity to anger and impulsiveness due to the chemicals our brain sends us. That was never acceptable, anger can be a very negative trait and people are very quick to villainize aggressive men. They almost never try to sympathize. I had to work on my emotions, I had to learn to control my anger, learn to control how I react *in spite* of what I feel. It feels like men are held to a higher standard, and I don't understand why. \n\nWhenever I see someone trying to explain a man's behavior based on their circumstances, no one cares. They feel we should have complete control over ourselves, they feel we should fight our inner desires that they themselves don't have to deal with or experience. I agree with that sentiment. Acting on your emotions can be very dangerous, and we should be able to use our emotions as a guide for how to act, not simply act everytime we feel an emotion. Women should be held to the same standards. If there's no excuses for men, then there's no excuses for women. CMV\n\nEdit: This post blew up quickly. To all those insulting me, I can understand your anger, but you should really learn how to have polite discussions. It's also pretty ironic given the subject matter.\n\nI agree with the view that it would be hard to deal with a sudden influx of emotions and hormones that you've never felt before. I can't say I know what that specific feeling is like. I still don't think it's an excuse to be harmful towards those around you, but it does help me to understand from an empathetic point of view. \n \nEdit 2: That's enough Reddit for today folks.

  "selftext": "first, i use “conservative” and “right” interchangeably. as far as i’m concerned, lincoln project and so-called “never trumpers” notwithstanding , they are one and the same, a distinction without a difference. this is not a debate about that.\n\nsecond, i’d like to preface this by saying that i’m not a fan of the democratic party, finding it too beholden to corporate interests, a fealty it likes to disguise by making shallow overtures to various identities (LGBT, black community, latinos, etc.) that mask its corporatist nature. \n\ni consider myself rather far to the left, a socialist in the sense that, like orwell, i desire a humane society in which all people are treated equally and afforded a chance to live a happy and fruitful life. i am obviously of the mind that such a world does not exist at the moment, and believe the primary reason that world is so remote from our reality is the conservative/far right movement in America.\n\ni would also like to add that i am referring to the american right, knowing full well that rightist philosophy has a concerning foothold in many other western nations. i am focusing on the american right because they exist within the most powerful country in the world, wielding enough influence on our culture and policy to have an  effect on the world and the people inhabiting this global community. \n\ni am firmly of the mind that humanity would take a leap forward of immeasurable length if the american right didn’t exist. why?\n\n- anti-intellectualism and anti-science are critical components of their belief system. american conservatives oppose an educated populace, for an informed public is a critically thinking one, a mass of curious and thoughtful men and women who seek the answers to the questions that lie at the heart of our understanding of one another and this world we occupy. the right in america continues to deny, in the face of incontrovertible evidence, the existence of climate change. whether it’s because of how corrupted it’s become under the influence of the fossil fuel industry or an actual belief that climate change is a manufactured crisis, the right rejects the proven science underlying the gravest threat humanity has faced since the advent of nuclear weaponry. \n\n- the right’s denial of the science that definitively proves the existence of climate change, and their wholesale refusal to work with democrats to craft sound policy that addresses this crisis, poses an existential threat that MUST be confronted at some point in the near future if we mean to rescue civilization from the cliff it now dangles over. \n\n- covid was the most recent example of how the anti-intellectualism and anti-science underpinnings of rightist thought is existential in nature. because of their refusal to accept the reality of covid and the various means with which we could protect ourselves and prevent it from spreading - masks, vaccines, social distancing, etc. - an unnecessarily high number of american citizens died, causing damage to our economy that we have yet to recover from. \n\n- the right is engaged in a full scale assault on schools and libraries, the institutions we entrust to help shape the minds of our children. removing books that address subject matter that would make our children more informed and empathetic guarantees a bleak future of citizens without a grasp of history and a context within which to process a proper response to our most pressing issues. \n\n- guns continue to be a scourge on our nation. i don’t necessarily support a ban on firearms, largely because i don’t think it would be practical at this point. but i know there are several common sense solutions that would certainly lower the level of carnage taking place. sadly, conservatives oppose any measure that addresses responsible gun ownership, finding it an infringement on their supposed right to bear arms. because of it, mass shootings are now so common as to become a mundane fact of life, no longer eliciting the shock it once did even a decade ago. \n\n- bigotry is at the core of rightist thought. an irrational hatred of anyone who is not straight, white and christian (although, many of them are atheists, too, i’ll admit) has always been a fundamental pillar of the rightist platform in america. whether it’s directed at black people, hispanic immigrants, muslims, or gays, the conservative movement in america thrives of dividing the public along these lines and ginning up hostility towards marginalized groups. \n\nthere’s plenty more i could write, but i’m not interested in composing an essay. i certainly don’t know what the answer is, though i believe society must find a solution to american conservative problem at some point if we mean to not just survive, but thrive as a civilization of people who live together in peace and work towards a brighter future in which all of us lead fulfilling and enriching lives.",

Over the last decade, the private gun ownership rate in Australia has increased significantly, returning to about 70% of the rate of the rate before Port Arthur. Despite this significant increase in private gun ownership rate, there was no correlative increase in homicides outside of trend rates.  \nMeanwhile, the largest decrease in homicides out of any advanced economy has been in America. Like the UK and Australia, America saw a rapid increase in homicides during the 80s and 90s. Despite an increasing rate of private gun ownership, the per capita homicide rates declined drastically during the 00's and into the late 2010s. In fact, America's homicide rate in the late 2010s dropped below the UKs homicide rate in the 90s.   \nAll 3 of these countries have since seen increases in homicide rates.  \nWhat this demonstrates is that gun laws seem to have very little, if any, impact on actual homicide rates. Since the purpose of gun bans supposed to be curtailing homicides, I see no evidence that support gun bans. Owning a gun will increase you risk of suicide, accidental deaths, etc., but this is true for swimming pools; swimming pools are, statistically, more dangerous to own than guns. I think owning a gun is stupid, but things aren't banned because they are stupid.  \nSince this is a non-issue, I believe we should default to liberty. ",

I don’t think divides are unbridgeable but they are very real and need to be acknowledged. Speaking of divides, I think progressive leftists and activists in the US need to acknowledge that Jewish patience is wearing thin. And while I’m not trying to speak for all Jews, from what I’ve seen, across the political spectrum, I think a lot of Jewish allies are increasingly disillusioned with the discourse coming from the Left and the perceived double standard applied to them. Take the most recent example where even mildly pro Jewish stances like that of Noah Schnapp, of Stranger Things fame, are rewarded with virulent antisemitism and patronizing “sit down and shut up white boy” talk from black and white activists on twitter and subs like r/fauxmoi. \n\nThe divide is only going to grow and get worse over time the more they refuse to acknowledge it and the more they refuse to acknowledge that antisemitism is growing amongst young blacks and Latinos.

  "selftext": "\nEdit: people are getting hung up on my choice of words. By annhilating I don't mean killing every last Hamas member or sympathizer - I mean forcibly overthrowing Hamas regime. \n\nFirst I want to say what this post isn't about - I am not here to talk about History or what led us to this situation - mostly because it's a much more complex topic than people often realize, but also because I doubt any of you can change my mind regarding the history of the conflict, frankly I believe I heard it all. In my view, the fact is that there are over 10 Million people from both sides that have nowhere else to go and have to learn to live with each other, the history of the conflict just doesn't matter all that much. \n\nFor context, there are at least 900 dead and over a hundred taken captive - most of which are civilians. \nIn past conflicts, where the number of deaths were limited to few dozens at most, and the sense of security of the general populace wasn't severely damaged - the government could easily contain the conflict. They would shoot down a few weapon caches, and killed a few Hamas opperatives to show they mean business, but essentially they didn't change the geopolitical situation, colleteral damage was limited, and it was only a matter of time until the next conflict.\n\nNow that Hamas killed so many, and essentially proved without a shadow of a doubt that they are the Islamic terrorists Israel has always feared, there is just no way the geopolitical situation can remain the same - I mean if they were actually the freedom fighters they claim to be, they could have decided to target military targets and spared the hundreds of civilians that ran for their lives. The sense of security Israelis had is long gone, and there is no way the country can just let it go - add to that the fact that Iran and Hezbollah are watching, can Israel really afford showing the rest of its enemies that it just doesn't care about something of this magnitude? \n\nNow, here's why I want my mind changed - overthrowing Hamas government in Gaza will result in many, many deaths. Since understandably, Israel cares more about its citizens and soldiers than the Gazans - they will carpet bomb entire neighborhoods to minimize deaths when going in for ground assaults. \nKeep in mind that Hamas leaderships are based in bunkers, and that any Gazan could be a terrorist waiting for them as far as Israel is concerned. \n\nI really don't see a realistic way for Israel to handle this situation that doesn't involve tons of collateral damage. And as sad as it makes me, I honestly don't feel like I care anymore - not because it isn't horrible, but because I don't think there is much of a choice here. Hamas has to be annihilated, and the collateral damage is a given, especially when Hamas goes out of its way to put civilians in harms way.\n\nMy only hope here is that this war will result in turning Gaza into more of Japan after pearl Harbor, rather than it turning to Afghanistan after 9/11. I still don't see an alternative choice either way.",

  "title": "CMV: The term 'manosphere' perpetuates unproductive stereotypes",
  "selftext": "I came across this term for the first time and I was immediately shocked by it.  Attempts to figure out why this term is used was met mostly by assertions of \"That's what we call it 🤷\" before I was shut down.  Not a very compelling answer, hence this post.  Below is the context, then reasoning, behind my shock.\n\nWhat is the term manosphere?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere\n\n> Communities within the manosphere include men's rights activists, incels (involuntary celibates), Men Going Their Own Way (MGTOW), pick-up artists (PUA), and fathers' rights groups.\n\n> While the specifics of each group's beliefs sometimes conflict, they are generally united in the belief that society is biased against men due to the influence of feminism, and that feminists promote misandry, or hatred of men.\n\n> Acceptance of these ideas is described as \"taking the red pill\", a metaphor borrowed from the film The Matrix.\n\nWhile I believe that male advocacy isn't inherently anti-feminist, that is a separate discussion.  I'm focusing on the term manosphere in this post.\n\nOne of the prevalent issues in online communities today is [polarization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_polarization#Attitude_polarization).  One method in which polarization propagates is through the mechanic described in [this CGP Grey video](https://youtu.be/rE3j_RHkqJc?si=mGwumnMQuHas_7wO), where an ideologically homogenous community depicts the \"opposing\" demographic as an antagonistic monolith.  \n\nWhat this means is that negative characteristics that exist in a subset (part) of the demographic are attributed to the entire demographic; asserting that what is sometimes true is actually always true.  These are what we know as [stereotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype).  These attributions are performed through [implicit language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype) (\"X is Y\"), instead of explicit language (\"I believe all X is Y\"). Through this, the demographic itself is painted as a perpetual threat or problem, rather than certain members of it.  \n\nThis applies to any \"competing\" demographics you can think of: the rich, the poor, men, women, young people, old people, conservatives, progressives, and so forth.  And this applies to any characteristic so long as, in polarized spaces, it's negative. From a desire to harm others, to corrupting society, to being incompetent.\n\nI'm sure you've seen it.  And while it's okay to not always be nuanced, what polarization does over time is [reinforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_theory) stereotypes to the point where they *feel* more true than anything else.  In a polarized space, this will be apparent when an attempt to address an oversimplification is met with hostility.  For individuals who have spent enough time in such spaces, the very concept of nuance or complexity may seem annoying or even manipulative.\n\nIt is this toxic reinforcement through implicit language that sits at the core of my view on the term 'manosphere'.  \n\nWith this in mind, does the term 'manosphere', which colloquially refers to toxic male spaces, contribute to this polarization-driven propagation of stereotypes?  I believe that it does, and it's this belief that you're invited to address.\n\nMy belief is that the male-specific prefix 'man'  in a word referring to toxic behavior ties the gender to that behavior in the same way that statements like \"Men are [negative characteristic]\" do.  By perpetuating a stereotype; \"this is how men act\". A word on its own really doesn't matter, no. However, the usage of the term in a polarized space (social media) causes it to be a problem, in my view.  Because of the synergy with the stereotypes that are already being reinforced.  \n\nIt can help to understand what I mean by removing ourselves from what's normalized.  For this, I will turn to female analogues.  \n\nTerms for controversial female groups use non-gender-specific qualifiers to lead the term.  Red-pilled women and trad wives being two common examples.  Imagine if we could place these groups under an umbrella called 'conservative femininity', but instead went with 'the femisphere', or perhaps 'woman-pilled'.  \n\nIt's offensive just on its face.  Because in my mind, it implies that the female gender is not only united in such behavior, but also that the gender is causative of this behavior.  It implies a stereotype; \"this is how women act\".  Again, I believe this is very problematic in a polarized space.\n\nTo close, the word unproductive in the title was chosen because I think an important element in navigating present gender issues is collaboration between the two main sides.  Perpetuating stereotypes (which of course are usually negative) about either side is unproductive because it both generates animosity and fails to recognize that behavior is not confined by your gender.  Why would you reach across the gender aisle if you have come to feel that there is something inherently wrong with the other gender?\n\nThank you for your time.",

  "selftext": "Let me just say, I don't support fat shaming. There are some who will swear up and down that it helped them lose weight and if they feel it's helpful that's their choice. But in general, I don't think insulting people leads to change. It's bullying and I'm against bullying. So where that aspect of the fat acceptance movement is concerned, I'm on board. \n\nSecond, I think the fat acceptance movement is right about a very important idea: weight is *not* the best indicator of health, even though almost all physicians take people's weights but don't measure their body composition, body composition is a far bettet indicator- more specifically where the fat is stored. Excess abdominal fat has been linked to inflammation and disease. Whether an individual is normal weight, underweight, or overweight. \n\nAnd if fat acceptance advocates said \"weight is not the best indicator of health here is a *better* one I would take no issue with the movement. But I feel like the movement is more interested in making fat people feel like they don't have to change than accurate health science. And the reality is that many fat people will be at risk for inflammation and all sorts of diseases going by the better barometers of health that I mentioned above.\n\nThe common responses I hear from defenders of the fat acceptance movement are: some people cannot change it (this is true and I believe those people are still at the risks mentioned above) and the people who can don't really *believe* they are healthy. \n\nBut I think these people are underestimating the ability of the mind to grab on to a comforting idea and buy into that idea if it means avoiding discomfort. If there's even the thought \"*maybe* I don't need to change, change won't happen.\" And that's what the movement does, it tells people they don't need to change. But sometimes, for their own well being, people do need to change. \n\nI feel like there's always this sort of tightrope walk between what's true and what makes others feel good. And if something cannot be changed, I don't think its beneficial to tell people \"here are the ways this quality can make your life worse\" when it's something that cannot be changed. \n\nBut when it's something that can be changed I feel like people have the right to know the benefits the change will bring (I think it's also good to frame it in this light.) Losing excess fat has many benefits. better immunity, feeling better internally, better sex life, more attractive to more people which helps when it comes to dating. On top of that, there are enormous benefits from eating a healthier diet and exercising regularly. The flip side of that, the part people probably shouldn't lead with, is that not losing excess fat has major detriments. \n\nThat's my view, but I don't know a ton about this topic and I'm open to changing it",

To use some examples from American politics, Christians have traditionally had high levels of control over the American government, and many recent- and present-day conservative causes (e.g. abortion and same-sex marriage) are enshrining Christian beliefs into law.  Wealthy families have traditionally held wealthy and it's a conservative cause to see tax and other laws passed so that wealthy families can stay wealthy from year-to-year and generation-to-generation.  Being able to live and be seen by society as your gender is something that has been historically just for cisgender people, so conservatives are more likely to oppose those for trans people.  Europeans immigrants and their descendants have traditionally held power of being a majority in America, and conservatism opposes and kind of immigration policy that threatens to change that.\n\nI've heard a couple of other proposed central conflicts between these two ideologies which I find unconvincing for the reasons I'll describe:\n\n* \"Conservatism is about having more freedom from government, while progressivism is about having more government control.\"  Doesn't take long to look at some policy differences to see how this isn't the case.  Look at abortion.  Look at same-sex marriage.  Look at immigration policy.\n\n* \"Conservatism is fundamentally about preserving systems and being more reluctant to change them, while progressivism is about being more eager to change them.\"  This aligns with reality more than the above proposed idea, but there is at least one way in which it fails: taxes.  [The top marginal tax rate has historically been much higher than it is now.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Velencia-Pollapalooza.0118-0117-1.png?w=575)  The \"keeping fences where they are\" approach to this would have been to keep them high.  However, conservatives have promoted cutting taxes for the wealthy (which is in line with preserving the good things in life to those that have historically had them).\n\n\nSo is there another central conflict that more accurately describes the central conflict between these two ideologies than this one? I don't believe so  Change my view.\n\ne: I put a fair amount of effort into typing this out, and people are responding by using the downvote button as a disagree button, violating reddiquette and also burying this topic to prevent people from seeing it.

In the US, the really strong immigration laws are just barely less than 100 years old, and this was after the constant scares of Asian and Irish/Italian immigrants during the 1800s, so it came after all that, not in response to it. It seems like even the racist people of old understood that it was someone’s freedom to migrate to another country, even if they personally disagreed with them doing so. Of course, this doesn’t just apply to the US; any stable country that isn’t based in extreme nationalism shouldn’t have a problem with immigrants.\n\nIf immigrants aren’t paying taxes, then that’s a separate crime entirely. If they are uneducated in general or in the civics of the country they entered or are unproductive, most countries already have plenty of those people and are getting by just fine. If they aren’t obeying the rule of law, that’s why we have police forces. Every problem with immigrants isn’t unique to them.\n\nEverything about illegal immigration as a concept circles back to race and nationalism somehow. At the very least, I don’t see why this isn’t true in countries with effective governments and stable economies that can support more people suddenly entering them.

I don’t want to discuss the actual conflict much, there’s plenty of that happening already, I just want to stick to the issue of LGBT people being pro-Palestine.

It’s not really my place to step in and say no, you people are too homophobic, you’re not allowed make your own decisions. To me, that’s a recipe for disaster and justification for a repeat of the colonialism of previous centuries. There are many sovereign countries today that are as homophobic as Palestine. That doesn’t make any other country justified in invading and occupying the people there. So that’s why I think it’s wrong to say that gay people should automatically be against self-determination for the Palestinian people just because they’re homophobic.\n\nEdit: a couple people are saying why does being gay even factor into it, why announce that you are gay when supporting Palestine?

  "selftext": "In theory, the concept is great. Let people debate on all topics and issues, with all viewpoints on the table, until a general consensus is reached. And that works with certain things, like the rules of sports/competitions. For example, I follow top-level chess. Recently, two players drew a game that was clearly prearranged, which a lot of people believe is match fixing, and so they were punished by the regulatory body, FIDE. Some people don’t believe that punishment was fair, and a lot of them are able to have rational discussions about whether that was really cheating. But in this case, the concept of the “marketplace of ideas” is useful. It’s a developing situation where both sides have merit.\n\nHowever, there’s some situations that aren’t developing, where there isn’t merit on both sides. Take gay marriage. There’s no rational reason to be against it. In fact, given the american Republican party’s focus on freedom and liberties, they should be all for it. But this is where the marketplace of ideas fails, because there will always be a group of religious people, however small, who stick their fingers in their ears and refuse to ever support gay marriage. And according to the marketplace of ideas, gay people now have to defend their right to exist, love, and marry, forever, without that argument ever being considered “won”, despite their side being the only side whose argument has merit.\n\nThe marketplace of ideas forces certain groups of people (queer people, POC, disabled people, and others) to defend their existence, for the rest of their lives, to people who will always hate them for no real reason, because you can’t change someone’s mind with logic if they didn’t arrive at their current opinion using logic.",

  "title": "CMV: Casually dating multiple people should be the norm prior to settling down in a monogamous relationship",
  "selftext": "It is such a huge commitment to only be with one person indefinitely. And most people agree to such a commitment within only a few months of getting to know each other, and for some people as little as a week. I don't understand why people view getting into a monogamous relationship as something that isn't that serious. It's not much different than an agreement of marriage aside from the legal difficulties that would be involved in the event of a break up/divorce. \n\nI think that casually dating people for at least a few years as a teen and young adult before choosing to settle down with a single person would be beneficial for a number of reasons. First, it would allow people to have comparisons and see what they truly want and what makes them happy/unhappy in a romantic/sexual relationship. I think this could also lower the amount of people who ignore the red flags in a relationship that becomes abusive because they've been able to see what it's like to be treated right by others or had the time and experiences necessary to realize the traits of an abusive person.\n\nAdditionally, it could help prevent the grass is greener effect that people tend to experience in long-term relationships when they haven't had much experience seeing people other than their partner. Having dated multiple other people, they are able to make a much more well-informed choice on who they want to spend their lives with and be more certain that they made the right decision without having to ignore as many doubts.\n\nA person would also be able to develop way better communication skills as they'd have to interact with people who may have very different needs/styles of communication. And they may be more exposed to their own faults as well and be able to work through them prior to settling into a serious relationship.\n\nAnd lastly, it allows people to develop more as a person. Having at least a few years without dependence on a single guy/girl allows the person to develop their own independence, helping prevent possible codepence in their future relationship because they know how to be on their own and rely on themselves. And the experiences they get with many other people allows them to be exposed to so many different hobbies/areas of life that they may have missed out on had they chosen to lock themselves down in a relationship with one person. This would allow a person to have a better understanding of themselves, have more dynamic interests, likes, and dislikes, and a fuller life experience in general.\n\nEDIT: my view has been changed. I now think that rather than this being the norm, it should be normalized. I still think it's beneficial for the reasons I listed, however I think alternative dating styles like the one I mentioned, in addition to monogamy, should be more accepted in today's society, rather than one being the typical or being pushed onto young people before they've had the chance to figure out what works best for them",

  "selftext": "I have only one important caveat: that the artists who's works have been used in image set without permission deserve recompence and the ability to opt out. Once the tech was proven to be possible and successful they should have destroyed those datasets and rebuilt them with proper respect to artists and copyright owners, before releasing the models to the public. Unfortunately now the cat is well and truly out of the bag and I don't think there is any going back.\n\nWith that in consideration; I think basically everyone discussing AI art on platforms like reddit, YouTube, pixiv, etc have a strong emotional bias against the technology, and are unable to discuss its merits. Commonly when an AI image is posted you see comments calling it soulless, bad art, obviously fake art, or just generally claiming it is objectively bad. Even when the art itself is cool or interesting. It seems like even expressing a neutral opinion about ai pieces will get you dozens of replies telling you you are objectively wrong, and that you should feel bad for being interested in the tech.\n\nI wouldn't call myself an artist these days, the most artsy thing I still do is 3D print and paint miniatures for dnd. I have had an artistic background though, before pivoting my career path to trades. I foresaw myself struggling too much to make a career as an actual artist (was training to go into theatre design) and decided I just want to live easily and keep my hobbies. \n\nArt has historically been full of gatekeepers. Photography was considered similarly soulless. Then when photoshop was created it was considered cheating. Even extremely famous artists were ignored in their time because their art was 'incorrect' as such. (Think van gogh). I feel a lot of people decrying AI art don't realise they are becoming the gatekeepers here by being resistant to change.\n\nI'm not sure what else I should include in this post, feel free to ask additional stuff in the replies. I suppose my personal opinion is like this: AI tools are here to stay, and they will improve and improve in the coming years until they're as good or better than traditional methods. Combined with other artistic tools it will be used to created incredible works of art. It has also opened up a world of creativity for many people who never found a way to express themselves artistically. Many of my fellow DND players are really happy that they can make character art without having to copy something from online or commission an artist. I think there will always be a place for talented artists, but that world is going to change massively, the same way that it has since the advent of digital art tools and methods.",

I have seen highlights before, but never watched a game from the start. We are currently \"15 minutes\" into the game, which may seem premature, but I've seen enough to see where this is going.\n\nA few reasons of why I'm finding this so boring:\n\n- constant set plays which last about 2 seconds.\n- the presentation is SO focused on entertainment over actual sporting contest. Fireworks, people dancing at the side of the pitch, loudspeaker announcements, advert after advert after advert etc. I'm here to watch sport, not WWE - which is what this feels like.\n- there is a HUGE disparity between positions/roles. Most (I'm aware, not all) sports, require all players to have a significant level of skill using a ball, or a tool of some sort. In this, it seems like only a very small number of players need to actually have handling/throwing skills - 90% of the players need no ball skill, and their only skills are based around physical strength/following instructions - this is boring.\n\nHow to change my view: If you try and argue about WHY American Football isn't boring, you will probably fail. Feel free to try, and I'm open to hearing, but it'll be an uphill battle. If you try and argue that another sport is MORE boring than this, you may succeed. I want to hear about what sports are even more boring than this.\n\nThanks.",

We can only know that some specific theories seem to hold up with expierment and observation very well, so far, but in the future it is probable that new technologies and new experiments prove those theories wrong. Such as with quantum mechanics.\n\nTo have this idea in your head, to truly have this idea in your head, requires a very strong ability of skepticism. That is what religion is fundamentally incompatible with. For a mind to identify with a religion strongly enough to be religious, they have to fundamentally lack this radical skepiticism and logical rigor that makes science work and allows boundaries to be pushed.\n\nEssentially to believe in something so strongly so as to identify religious, full well knowing all the uncertainties and alternate possibilities, is to not be a true scientist. A true scientist is to be rigorous and skeptical to a fault, not belief from personal experience, or deference to an authority.\n\nThis is where you get folks who will use such phrasing as \"the studies suggest...\" when the studies do not suggest, they simply are, it is the people making assumptions based on a result that are doing the suggesting.\n\nEdit: btw not suggesting any religious scientist is somehow automatically disqualified or less intelligent etc. I think almost everyone has this kind of shortcoming in terms of unjustified belief and bias. When I suggest science is incompatible with religion, I'm merely suggesting that it is in fact a flaw, that these people are good scientists in spite of their religiosity and not because of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

White privilege, rich privilege, male privilege, female privilege, etc. I’ve even seen posts recently talking about the privilege of having a loving family and how we need to be more critical of our behavior towards children as a result of it.\n\nI think the main issue that comes from privilege is when people are ignorant of the privileges they possess, or even when people use their privilege as a means of hurting or oppressing others who lack those advantages. My view though, is that privilege is a good thing that should be celebrated rather than shunned or ridiculed or looked down upon. The fact that people today have it easier than people before is something to be proud of, so long as we’re still cognizant of the fact that the privilege needs to be spread more and more to those who currently lack it.\n\nSome children are born into rich loving families that support them emotionally and provide them with resources to achieve their goals in life and they’re made fun of or told to be ashamed of that, which seems to me like a bad case of crab in a bucket syndrome.

I agree, but that isn't the only way to acheive the goal.\n\nThere are many positions on dog training and dog ownership that are held by a majority of experts and backed up by peer-reviewed studies (socialization is vital, negative reinforcement doesn't work, etc.). There are also empirical facts (owning a dog costs between 20 and 55k over the cost of their lifetime, some breeds have a provable likelihood of contracting an expensive illness). Yet, [54% of dog owners have regrets about getting a dog](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/pet-insurance/survey-pet-ownership-regret-dog/). [26% of people who give up their dogs do so because the medical expenses are too high.](https://www.aspca.org/about-us/press-releases/more-1-million-households-forced-give-their-beloved-pet-each-year-aspca)\n\nThe point can't be reasonably argued that: a significant portion of the general dog owning population is dramatically undereducated about the responsibility of dog ownership.\n\nA multiple choice test is frequently used to determine access to certain privelages. For a lot of things, you can take an online test for a nominal fee. The logistical implications for this are minimal. Set up a website, compile reasearch, prove that you've discussed the questions with experts, and people bring the certificate in themselves. It could easily be funded with donations and kept running with the fees.\n\nIt is not a silver bullet. It is an acknowledgement that at one time, a prospective dog owner had to breifly retain that their new dog was going to cost them a lot of money and require a lot of time. If their life circumstances change, that's one thing, but they will for (a small amount of time) be presented with the information that they'll have to afford another 3k a year if they want the dog. The efficacy rate of this is impossible to speculate. My argument is that this method has been deemed essential for many other priveleges. \n\nFor those who will say shelters are overcrowded, that dogs need to be adopted, and we shouldn't put ANY financial barrier in place; I disagree. I believe more dogs will be put down at first, but that the situation will correct itself as the population becomes slightly more educated leading to a generally higher quality of life for a higher number of dogs. \n\nWhat am I not seeing here?",

  "title": "CMV: If Palestine was \"free\" it would be a ethno-fascist hellscape, and a single-state solution is only marginally better",
  "selftext": "EDIT: Please make sure you read the edits below where I summarise some of the best arguments (to me) that made me partially change my view.\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhen you ask, fundamentally, what many of the hordes of people in the west protesting against Israel really want for the region,  many will, when pressed, eventually acknowledge they dont actually want the usual public demand of a two state solution along 1967 borders with land swaps.   This is actually pretty explicit from the ubiquitous protest chant \"From the River \\[Jordan\\] to the Sea \\[Med\\], Palestine must be free\", which clearly requires the conception of Israel to cease to be in favour of a single Palestinian state.\n\nSo what they are really arguing for is a single state solution.    Let's be incredibly generous and give them the benefit of the doubt and suggest that the single state is created without genocide, and protects both Jews and Muslims (and Christians, Atheists, even, gasp, apostates) equally.   What happens?\n\nWell, since the 650-700k Palestinians left (or were forced to leave) their homes in what was the Mandate of Palestine from threat of violence (and at least partly at the urging of the Arab state neighbours massing troops on the borders in anticipation of invasion), a lot of time has past and now there's upwards of 6m+ refugees and their descendants (fun fact, when counting Palestinian refugees for official purposes only patrilineal descendants count- score 1 for the patriarchy!  Possibly a further 2-3m more people can claim descendance from Palestinian refugee antecedents).\n\nAssuming a decent proportion of this number exercised a right to return or a right to citizenship, combined with existing populations in Gaza, the West Bank, and Israeli Muslims, would give the new unitary Levant state a significant Muslim majority.\n\nBut what would that population be like?   Well, polling of Palestinian refugees is pretty clear on what they would vote for - hardline Islamists, most likely full jihadis.   The original charter (not repealed, only supplemented) of Hamas (approval rate: 60%) expressly calls for driving the Jews into the sea, and half of Gazans actively support this goal.  Several more extreme groups have higher approval rates (Lion's Den: 75%)\n\nIn a two state solution, its obvious that the Palestinian state would elect a government extremely hostile to their Jewish neighbour.  Anyone who says different is deluded; their argument usually goes \"Palestinian hostility to Israel is Israels fault - if the occupation ended they'd have no reason to continue to be hostile\".   This ignores how Jews are treated in the world's Muslim majority states. Try being an apostate or Jew in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.   Even Turkey.   It's hard to imagine a Palestinian state, whose population would be in large less educated, more hardline, poorer and more religious than those of any of those states, would somehow fulfil the progressive wet dreams of the pro-palestine protesters.  Much more likely any Palestinian state would be fun by violent religious ultranationalists (comparisons with Israel perhaps hold).   The prevailing atttitudes towards women, LGBT issues, apostasy and other religions etc. would likely be substantially worse than in Israel.   Borders with Israel would need to remain locked down to avoid constant violent clashes (in both directions).  Travel between Gaza and the West Bank would have to remain extremely tightly proscribed (unless someone builds a tunnel!)\n\nIn a single state solution, you import all these problems into a state which needs to represent the interests of two utterly dissimilar populations.   It's hard to imagine how this would work, perhaps some kind of strictly enforced apportioned (but not proportionate) representation, constitutional safeguards with supermajority requirements etc..  Even then, it's likely there would be distinct local government (perhaps a federated republic?) of different Jewish and Palestinian areas of the state, and this is where things would get sticky.    Would the federal state be able to mandate Israeli-style anti discrimination laws, e.g. based on gender,  or for example outlawing Polygamy, when this is a normal part of life for many Palestinians?   How would Shariah law, which Palestinians are governed by, interact with this Federal law?  Would terrorist organisations like Hamas be allowed to take part in political life?\n\nUltimately as Palestinians who have emigrated return en masse and (due also to higher birth rates), the small Muslim majority in the unitary state could become an overwhelming one.  Constitutional safeguards are suddenly increasingly under threat and federal politics will remain deadlocked between two totally mis-aligned factions.  Pressure to take from the wealthy former-Israelis and give to the poor former-Palestinians would be overwhelming.  Public conflict between sectarian groups would be inevitable.   Under these conditions, its hard to imagine the state's safeguards remaining intact.  Likely, civil society would break down.\n\nThere are no easy answers, but I've yet to hear a cohesive vision from anyone that sounds like something any Israeli should support, even if they also want (rightly!) an end to all illegal settlement in the West Bank and the deplorable conditions in Gaza.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDITS BELOW:\n\nEdit: I've awarded some deltas and have partially changed my view regarding a two state solution being unworkable.  Among the best points raised:\n\n- Palestine has exceptionally high literacy and education rates.  The diaspora is highly educated and relatively Liberal.  They look a lot more like Lebanese or Jordanians than iraqis or afghanis.\n\n- a new Palestinian state doesn't initially need to be a democracy or even self ruling. The UN could mandate a transitional period during which living standards could be brought up to par without major security concerns to Israel\n\n- it's obvious that a two state solution will work better than one state if you believe (as I do) that the Jewish people have a need for self governance given their long history of persecution\n\n- while a new Palestinian state MIGHT be a pretty regressive place especially for any women or minorities, so what? It already is.  It would doubtless be better in some ways, and if it could prosper, it would likely improve over time, especially as more liberal diaspora return.",

This would be absolutely inconceivable in soccer, where the highest ambition and glory of any player in their career is to win a world cup for their country. \n\nI remember when Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavs), I forget if it was around the time of the 2012 or the 2016 Olympics, said of Dirk Nowitzki something to the effect of (and I’m paraphrasing): “We don’t pay him Xmillion per year for him to go play for NBC for free.”  \n\nI thought that was a fascinating and incredibly telling framing of the issue.

  "selftext": "\nSo I feel that the factors that make men attractive are more on the side of immutable while for women they aren’t. If you are a woman, and you want to be physically attractive all you really have to do is not be fat in an unattractive way. Sure some women distribute weight differently which is immutable, but most women alive do not have health issues preventing them from not being a healthy weight. Once a woman hits that point it isn’t really going to matter what the rest of her body looks like. \n\nFor men I would say this same logic applies as there’s nothing stopping most men from hitting the gym and eating right. The only thing I would say is that getting muscular is much harder than just being skinny.\n\nAttractive men are imposing physically. This mostly means at least being tall, and when you look at the men today who are considered sex symbols, it’s all tall men. No matter the variant of attractiveness with few exceptions. Micheal B. Jordan, Ryan Gosling, and Chris Evans  all 6’0, Timothy Chalemet, Pedro Pascal, Brad Pitt, 5’11. Pete Davidson, Ashton Kutcher, the Hemsworths, Tom Brady, Jacob Eliordi, Will Smith, Ben Affleck and so many other widely considered attractive people are 6’2+. Height is important in male attractiveness.\n\nI would also argue bone structure and skull shape matter much more for men than it does women to be attractive. While face looks different they all have bone structure that highlights their masculine features. Well defined Jawline, high cheekbones lower amounts of buccal fat, sunken eyes, and a strong brow, square head shape. All things that can’t be built in the gym or through a clean diet or whatever. Eye shape is also important. Canthil tilt and the presence of hunter or prey eyes can make or break facial attractiveness.\n\nHealth in of itself is hard to control but a healthy appearance is even harder,  but this mainly comes down to one thing in men. Hair. If hair is thinning it’s over. Shaving can salvage you but if it you don’t have the right head shape, you’re fucked. Again uncontrollable.\n\nI don’t think any of this is nearly as important for women. Women of every shape and size are considered to be attractive . Taylor Swift is admired for her beauty while at the same time many thought Lizzo was beautiful. Bone structure doesn’t matter because there are certain prevailing features for a woman’s face to have. \n\nOn health, weight is important but is mostly controlable just as for men. The other things that could hurt women is excessive wrinkling and balding, which I don’t think is a huge deal for women thanks to the resources available to women.\n\nThere’s exponentially more resources for style, fashion, skincare, makeup, beauty etc. There are so many skilled makeup artists that put out their guides for free for women to learn from. The female fashion industry is huge, much bigger than mens and most clothes stores are made with women in mind. Everything appearance related is made with women at the forefront of thought. \n\nMen don’t participate because until recently most of us were competing for women with a mini Chris Hemsworth. There’s not many mens make up tutorials or mens fashion tutorials for men trying to attract women. There’s not many learning resources on male skincare like there are for women. There’s a much larger barrier of entry and you have to discover how to for yourself which is a lot harder than just looking up one of the millions of makeup tutorials for women.\n\nAnd since most of what makes women attractive isn’t immutable jut makeup, hair styling, and a nice outfit genuinely can make a 3 an 8. Men cannot put on makeup and a nice outfit and go from a 3 to an 8. There’s also not many ways for men.",

It is possible to feel your masculine or feminine side. \n\nMy problem or one of them is they/them in first person to use as an identity within the first person category. It makes me uncomfortable. So, I use their name or my friend to avoid us being both uncomfortable because unless you REALLY hate your name, it can be a good solution for both people to feel comfortable and to avoid any real problems. \n\nAnother issue I have is the complete denial of your gender. Maybe I'm getting this part wrong and it's not gender denial but it just seems like it is. I feel there's a difference between feelings you are not a certain gender one day and proof that biologically you are a guy or a girl. So when someone says \"I'm not a guy\" or I'm not a girl\" you are, though. The proof you have is feelings. The prove I can give is science and nature and research and doctors and birth certificates,  chromosomes, and pulling your pants down. Can you prove you are not your gender with feelings? That is the question. Please, Change my view. I do want to understand this.\n\nEdit: ok I guess I'll have to address this. So far there's only redditor that has been able to change my view a little bit with feelings. This redditor has said there are people that use Non-binary for attention and then there are some that this means something important to them. To ike3800, thank you for making me see that. I realized that I have to keep that in mind, the difference between this being a joke to someone and this meaning the world. You have changed my view.\n\n2nd Edit: if anyone has any argument that doesn't include androgen insensitivity, Trans gender reassignment, Sex and gender not being the same and a chopped off sex organ, please let me know because I've answered this SO MUCH.

  "selftext": "Ever read an athiest or Christian ramble about why religion is either essential or idiotic? I see it all over this subreddit -- mostly people saying its a plague or inherintly destructive to society.\n\nReligion is the belief in and reverence for a supernatural power or powers, regarded as creating and governing the universe.\n\nAll squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares; likewise, all evil/stupid religious practices are religion, but not all religion is evil/stupid.\n\nReligion has violated the rights of millions of women in the Middle East. Religion has also led to the formation of the Catholic church, a church with the love of money (the root of all evil, as stated in the Bible). \n\nAt the same time, America's founding fathers built a system of goverment with the sole purpose of protecting man's inablienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. They did this not out of purely secular logic, but belief that our creator intended for such liberties be endowed within every equal man.\n\nIt turned out that this system was incredibly flawed; however, Religion has also inspired Martin Luther King Jr. to lead the greatest civil rights movement in American history. A civil rights movement based upon love and respect for one another. He is celebrated by pretty much everyone, regardless of faith, even though he derives most of his ideas and argument from God and other believers.\n\nSome of the greatest scientists (like Albert Einstein) believed in a God; there is no possible argument that a creator (notice how I am not naming a specific religion or practice?) is somehow anti-science or anti-creativity.\n\nCharles Darwin (the one who discovered evolution theory) believed in a creator, and yet, I see people use his ideas to disprove creation. The story of Adam and Eve isn't the only religious idea behind creation!\n\nWhen I go to church every sunday, we pass out food to the homeless, sing together, and celebrate our love for one another.\n\nIt is an incredibly complex, abstract genre of ideas. Religion is so many things. It has been both the cause of awful wars, and source of break-throughs in morality. Some organized religions are cultish, others, open to anyone regardless of culture, race, sexuality, etc.\n\nMany redditors preach their faith in various subreddits, and claim themselves more righteous because of their beliefs. Similarly, many redditors on this platform believe religion to be evil, stupid, an opiate of the masses, illogical, or pointless. They proceed to build an argument using specific religions/specific examples from religions without acknowleging its incredible complexity, variety, and nuance. \n\nMost arguments on reddit, with a ton in this sub, about \"religion\" creates confusion, hatred, and chaos because they fail to praise/attack specific aspects of specific religions.\n\nStupid example:\nLets say I'm at the gym and some dude on the bench press starts yelling at me because I asked for a turn. I dont then go on reddit and say \"men are bad because of toxic masculinity caused by testosterone.\" Instead, I should say: \"roid-raging gym rats are annoying because of toxic masculinity caused by testosterone.\" See how, by not generalizing, I manage to create an intelligent, rational, and approachable argument? It's still debatable, but not so confusing and vague that it comes off as hostile.\n\nReligion is deeply rooted in almost all society and culture; It is not a primitive version of science; it should not be supressed and it should not be forced; It is not inherintly good nor bad, genius nor stupid. \n\nWe need to stop treating religion like its an idea that's objectivley right or wrong.\n\nChange my mind.",

  "selftext": "I am not a tradwife, and I get annoyed because I feel like only tradwife and conservatives ever kind of make this point (fine if u wanna do that, but they make the point in a way I don't like). Feminism has done a great job in uplifting women, in allowing us to access spaces previously only allowed for men, to give us more independence and societal power. Earlier waves of feminism haven't focused on uplifting femininity because they had bigger things to focus on like, like fighting for women's right to be \"masculine\".\n\nHowever, I think we as a society, men and women, need to now grapple with the fact that anything traditionally feminine is never seen as important, hard, or worthwhile as things that are masculine. Child-rearing, teaching, housework, its all seen as \"less than\" compared to being a CEO for example. Even art that was traditionally done by women, like cross stitching, weaving, etc etc, aren't seen as \"fine art\" in the same way that sculpture or painting is. I think thats stupid. I think that it also makes men feel like they shouldn't try to do \"feminine\" things because femininity is \"embarrassing\".  Masculinity has always been seen as empowering, thats the reason why women needed to fight so hard to be able to be \"masculine\", but now we need to fight for femininity to be just as empowering. \n\nFeminism fights for equality between the sexes, so it also fights for men's rights, and now i think we need to fight for men's right to \"feminine\". I feel like anything that is labeled as \"feminine\" is seen as bad, and this ranges from wearing dresses to being emotionally in tune with yourself. I think it would be great if there was a body positive movement for men, for example. However, a lot more men need to get involved and fight in the movement for this to happen. While feminism has made a ton of strides, we still have a lot more work to do to protect women's rights that are being threatened. I also just don't think that women pushing for men to be more in tune with their feminine side, for their body positivity movement etc, would be nearly as successful and powerful as men pushing for it themselves. \n\nTo be clear: I do NOT think this means more women should be more feminine. Thats an individual choice. However, I do think that men and women who choose to be feminine are still seen as less than (and I think that traditionalists who want women to go back to being feminine also see femininity as less than, which is terrible). We need to make it so femininity isn't seen as inferior to masculinity. We need to make it so there is no shame or stigma for man or woman to be as feminine or masculine as they want. ",

I have noticed this specifically with straight men. The vast majority of people who ask me if I'm gay or whether I'm a \"top\" or \"bottom\" are straight men, I rarely get women asking those questions. I have noticed that (in most cases) they ask this question because they need confirmation that you're gay so they can give you less respect than they would if you were straight. Once you confirm that you're gay, they will automatically change the way they treat you because, in their minds, gay men are inferior to straight men. Although society has become far more accepting of gay people, a lot of straight men still hold this view but won't admit it. Most young boys call each other \"gay \" as an insult or they use the word in a derogatory way because there is still a negative connotation attached to that word or to homosexuality in general (especially male homosexuality). This deeply rooted mentality carries over and sticks with them as they get older, and even if they become more tolerant and accepting of gay men, they still view us as less than. To them, a gay man is less of a man and isn't worthy of being respected as a \"real man.\" They still have the mentality that being attracted to women is the epitome of manhood and that only straight men are \"real men.\" Even when they ask us questions about our sex lives, they assume that everything is different for us because we are not normal to them. We are still seen as \"other,\" and there is no way that we can possibly have the same experiences as they do.

Also, this could help this minority of kids’ to know their medical heritage and not go through some trauma related to the discovery.\n\nThe only good arguments about not doing it - imo - would be the cost of it and how we treat data. But for the sake of the the argument, let’s say a paternity test is as quick an easy as a Covid test and our data protection laws are perfect.\n\nSo, CMV?\n\nAlso, there are bad actors in relationships and any other social interaction. This is not a post to make generalities about people based on their sex.\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo here’s an update after going through some comments:\n\nSome good arguments were made about the role of the medical teams. Is it their place to confront the couple and at that moment? I think some of you are right. It is not.\n\nAnother good point was the fact that to do these tests, you would need the father’s dna. This cannot be automated because the father needs to consent. The father can be manipulated to not consenting or just don’t think he should be worried and therefore the whole point of these tests falls appart.\n\nI disagree with the argument saying that this question makes no sense because the technology is not available. With today’s speed of innovation, we could have these tests in a decade or two. I also don’t think this being a hypothetical questions invalids it.\n\nFinally, I also disagree with the argument that it’s not too frequent so we shouldn’t care.

Another study, from 2008, points at under 1% (thanks to the people sharing the study :) ).

Age 14 is still far too young to have access to the internet and i think it should've always been 18.\n\nI do not even think 14-18 year olds should have the internet outside certain uses. No child needs the internet. There is growing evidence that the internet is very negatively impacting the mental health of teenagers, especially social media. I think 18 is a much better restriction than 14. 14 year old brains are still developing and I do not think 14-18 year olds should use the internet outside educational use.\n\nI believe that all children under the age of 18 should not use the internet outside exclusively educational use or the reporting of abuse. (Essentially only remote learning on school computers, or online therapy sessions.)\n\nIf streaming services count, I guess that's an exception. However children under the age of 18 should not have personal TVs. It will just be shows on the living room TV Screen.\n\nMy reasons for this view is because of alarming rates of inappropriate content exposure among children, problems in attention span, obesity, eating disorders, self harm, suicide, substance abuse, and mental health issues such as depression or anxiety forming because of it. This has all been studied and can be easily researched. I think internet use of any kind for children under the age of 18 is harmful for this said reason. \n\nChildren under the age of 18 should also not have personal accounts on streaming services or use any social media or online video game. Social media is not safe for children. Social media in particular causes anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and obesity.\n\nChildren under the age of 18 should also not have personal devices, including tablets, phones, or computers. Under 18 should not use electronics in the bedroom.  kitchen, public use, and living room only. I originally thought anyone 16 and up should have unrestricted access to the internet, however, the internet can also have a negative impact on teen's mental health so i just raised it to 18.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nAnxiety and Depression: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7028365/\n\nEating Disorders: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6769899/\n\nObesity: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5769928/\n\nSuicide: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6278213/\n\nHowever many people think I am a little too extreme in this subject.

Children should also not use social media at all.\n\nUPDATE: I think that age 14 is still far too young, i do not think children under the age of 18 should use the internet outside certain uses. There is growing evidence that the internet can have a negative impact on teen mental health and wellbeing.\n\nI also do not think that a 16- or 17-year-old should have unrestricted access to the internet in any way. A child under the age of 18 should not be using social media at all.\n\nA child between 14 and 18 years of age should also not be using the internet, except for educational purposes, kind of like how younger children shouldn't.\n\nChange My View?",

  "selftext": "I was previously against student loan forgiveness. After being surrounded by others and continuing to listen to stories of people struggling, I have changed my mind. It's going to be a ramble down below.\n\n  \nOriginally, my stance was financial viability, academic, and accountability reforms including capping student loan interest rates, expanding public service student loan program, publishing degree outcomes data (How many students found a full-time job? How many of those pertains to their degree? Were they able to enter graduate school?) and increasing personal accountability. There is already an attendance and GPA policy for those who take out federal loans. However, the GPA requirement is at 2.0. Does it demonstrate that the student has sufficient knowledge of the course? Higher GPA should be considered. At the same time, students should have access to free resources to close the gap in their learning. It helps to increase competency in the student.  \n\n  \nI still stand for those things, because they are important to reshaping the higher education landscape. However, I also now stand for student loan forgiveness. I paid the rest of my student loan debt today. I grew up poor, but I have moved on from that life and I absolutely do not take that for granted. People say money does not buy happiness, but money can buy financial peace. We have enough in this planet to feed and housed everyone. However, with the way the current system is designed, many people are born into an unlucky lottery and their existence is trying to make the best of their lives without having the system drown them. I understand the people who are against student loan forgiveness. Some had to work hard and to make sacrifices to pay off their own student loans. Some do not want to be responsible and have their tax dollars bail out those individuals who signed for those loans in the first place. America was built on the \"can-do-it\" attitude and personal responsibility. However, the world has changed, and America has yet to adapt to the current landscape. Everything cost much more than back then. Housing, food, and healthcare are tremendous burdens on everyone's' shoulders. From elementary to high school, everyone is told to go to college and that will prepare them for higher pay and a better life. Why should they say any differently? Many papers were published to support that. \n\nWith good intentions, school counselors prepared everyone to be admitted at some college - any college. If they could not afford it, there were student loans that students can take, and it would be a definite worthwhile investment. However, the Bachelor's degree no longer leads to the promised land. Why? Because the world has changed. The progress of technology has led us to this modern world. We have yet to adapt to it. People are struggling under crippling debt. It is not only the financial toll. Not only does the loan-taker pays for it, their parents, spouses, and children do too.  According to the APA, \"Compared to other touchy topics, couples' arguments about money tend to be more intense, more problematic and more likely to remain unresolved.\" These people have tried to do the right thing by following what has been pushed their entire lives. Go to college and get that better job.  One person used to be able to raise a family from a factory job. What factory jobs do we have now? What good paying jobs do we actually have? Not everyone can be doctors, CEOs, or engineers. For this current group of student loan borrowers, everyone should have their loans forgiven and our whole educational system need a serious reform for our future generations. It will alleviate the suffering of the loan borrower and the family around them. Consequently, it leaves the energy and door open to uplift their immediate community.  With less stress all-around, I wonder how that translates to everyone's daily lives. I see it as an opportunity to raise America up as a whole.  People should not have to work two jobs to have a roof over their head and to afford food to eat. There are viable pathways for it, but that will lead me into another long ramble.\n\n  \nTLDR: Support Student Loan Forgiveness. It will reap short-term and long-term benefits for everyone. ",

  "title": "CMV: Squid Game is not really \"about capitalism\"",
  "selftext": "Obviously, spoilers for Squid Game follow. I enjoyed it enough to include a spoiler warning, and if you haven't seen it, you won't be able to contribute to this dicussion.\n\nI was underwhelmed by the purported anticapitalist message of the hit Netflix series. More than in the trivial way in which any depiction of life under capitalism is to some extent \"about capitalism\", I expected the series to offer a critique of capitalism *per se*. Instead, it left me with the impression of a tragic horror story told *within* capitalism. Basically, I saw only a bad thing happening *in* capitalism, not a bad thing happening *because of* capitalism. I'm hoping to learn that I've missed something which will reveal the critique of capitalism *per se* that the series offers, if it actually does.\n\nBefore you call me a clueless liberal who couldn't recognize a blaring anticapitalist messaging if it hit me in the face, I'm a Marxist academic who has taught Marx in college courses. I am not an expert, but I can speak competently about Marxism, and I'm consistently able to interpet anticapitalist subtext in media (such as the masterpiece Korean film *Parasite*, for comparison). I'm more prepared than most to detect anticapitalism in art, and anticapitalism is a central theme of some of my favorite art. I just don't think Squid Game is all that anticapitalist.\n\nI'll now try my best to detail a few of the reason why Squid Game, as I've understood it, fails to offer a fundamental critique of capitalism. I'll close with a paragraph on what I think a critique of capitalism must contain. If you show me that it does contain what I think a critique should contain, or that I'm wrong about what a critique should contain, you'll have changed my view.\n\n1. First and foremost, the Squid Game is *illegal*. It does not exist because of the system, but in spite of it, and a good deal of the series focuses on a cop's quest to shut it down. It is easy to imagine an analogue to the Squid Game being held under any political or economic system. Capitalism does facilitate the commission of atrocities of various kinds that are at least nominally illegal (slave and child labor, for example) and does systemically fail to redress these crimes - so I do not argue that the bare fact that the Squid Game is illegal in capitalist South Korea precludes it from providing a critique of capitalism. Rather, I argue that the Squid Game, as depicted in the show, is a crime not peculiarly capitalist in nature.\n2. Squid Game depicts the desperate poor willing to die and kill for a chance of escape from poverty. At the superficial level, this is easy to read as anticapitalist. But it is only anticapitalist if it attributes their poverty and their desperation as a result of capitalist systems. Gi-Hun is a degenerate gambler, not an exploited worker. His briefly mentioned business (a noodle shop, I think?) fails for unremarked reasons, and I don't recall why he does not work now. I think I would recall why he is out of work if the series made explicit that the cause was due to a systemic failure of capitalism. The only hint about this I remember is his brief flashback to a union strike turned violent after police aggression. This single moment was the most anticapitalist message I took away from the series, and it's over in a flash and never brought up again. Given that he is broke because of a gambling addiction, and not because of the machinations of capitalism to ensure the emiseration of workers, I can't read his poverty as a failure of capitalism. For comparison, his friend Sang-Woo is an investment broker (a capitalist) who is in debt for the same reasons - a bad bet.\n3. Its depiction of the desperate poor is juxtaposed with its depiction of the monstrous rich. Again, at a superficial level, this is easily read as anticapitalist. But again, the series never claims that capitalism encourages the *production* of monsters among the rich. They are simply monsters, and they are rich; no link is claimed, whether it is that their wealth makes them monsters, or that their monstrosity leads to their accumulation of wealth. The most we get to suggest this is Oh Il-Nam's explanation for starting the Squid Game that he and his friends were so rich that they got bored. This could have been the start of a critique of the emptiness of consumerism, but it doesn't follow through. Squid Game is an underground, niche interest for rich *psychopaths*, not for the rich as a class, who the show does not claim are generally psychopathic. There are also comparably monstrous people among the poor, embodied in the gangster Jang Deok-Su.\n4. The Front Man executes an employee for breaking the rules of the game, saying something along the lines of \"the fairness of the game is sacred.\" This is vaguely reminiscent of liberal rhetoric about the meritocratic virtues of the free market. This excited me - I thought, at last, the series would flesh out the ideology of the Squid Game organizers in order to draw parallels. But this is as far as it goes.\n5. In the final episode, it is revealed that Oh Il-Nam, the old man, player 001, is the organizer of the Squid Game and a moneylender. In the English translation, he says that he \"earns a living, lending out money.\" Gi-Hun responds, with some disgust, that \"you give money to people for a living, and you get rich doing it?\" Oh Il-Nam responds \"you know what making money is like, it's not a simple thing to do.\" At this point in the show, I've given up on seeing a critique of capitalism, but this piqued my interest - would they talk about M-C-M'? About the fundamental fact of capitalism, that control of sufficient capital allows one to acquire exponentially greater capital? We get a short follow up on this. Later in the episode a news report flashes: \"INCREASE IN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD DEBT RANKING KOREA 2ND GLOBALLY\", attributing its cause to \"lifted government restrictions on financial loans.\" So, something like the American financial crash of 2008 (maybe Koreans can help me on the context of this, if it's not fictional). But there is so little detail given, and what is given is just \"the government made a bad policy that caused a rise in debt.\" Critiques of *policy* under capitalism are not critiques of capitalism. To regulate more or less is the eternal debate held between capitalist parties in all capitalist countries, and the series hands this particular win to those favoring a bit more regulation. If the show depicted the government as being owned wholesale by capitalist interests, such that it was incapable of passing policy that would not lead to the emiseration of the proletariat, this would be a critique. But as presented, it is attributable to a blunder.\n\nThroughout, the series drops hints and gestures toward a critique of capitalism, but it always fails to follow through to actually saying something. A critique of capitalism should identify capitalism specifically as the root cause, or at least as the primary exacerbator, of some bad thing. It should do this by, for example, identifying the wage-labor relationship as intrinsically exploitative, or demonstrating the incentive of the bourgeoisie to emiserate the proletariat, or arguing that the extreme disparities of wealth capitalism creates produces dehumanizing conditions, or presenting the extraordinary levels of waste and overproduction inherent to a system that prioritizes the sale of commodities above all else, or satirizing the emptiness of art produced solely for profit. Unless there are complex references and symbols at play that are illegible to non-Korean audiences, or if I've for some reason been especially inattentive to the series, Squid Game doesn't do any of this.",

  "selftext": "I’ve seen some posts recently both in this sub and in r/LetsTalkMusic where people complain about contemporary music being dumbed down and bad; about how musicianship and songwriting are no longer appreciated; about how X artist’s popularity is merely manufactured and reflects a dying culture; and so on.\n\n \n\nThese posts are invariably made by people who just don’t actually listen to enough music. \n\n \n\n**My CMV statement: we are living in a golden age of music and there is plenty of music out there to serve the tastes of literally any person.**\n\n \n\nUsually when people complain about the state of music, they are actually just complaining about how the trends in mainstream pop don’t appeal to them.  To some people, listening to music should be a very social experience and it sucks to think that nobody is listening to the music that most appeals to you – this is totally valid.  But what people don’t understand is that the popularity dynamics of music have changed drastically. \n\n \n\nIt used to be the case that the mainstream was very important, because the options outside the mainstream were so limited.  You could still get into indie music, but it was a very isolating experience.  But what people don’t understand is that what used to be a massive gulf between the mainstream and indie is now very narrow.  It’s almost more like we now have three tiers instead of two: the mainstream, an indie “middlestream,” and an underground of amateur music.  This “middlestream” has formed out of a combination of streaming, social media, music festival culture, and also the current golden age of streaming-television we are also experiencing.  Indie artists that would have been ignored 20 years ago now are able to maintain decent-sized dedicated fanbases which allow them to steadily produce crafted, highly original and unique music.\n\n \n\nI also think it’s the case that the deficiency of the mainstream is overstated.  People complain about the popularity of Taylor Swift or Bad Bunny as if they make bad music, but these complaints rarely contain any substantial criticism and they usually can be reduced to “this wasn’t made for me so it’s bad.”  This is especially true with the trend of young men trashing Taylor Swift – like, what the hell are they thinking?  Of course they don’t like Swift, her music is written for young women!  But in any case, the criticisms of the mainstream can always be precluded by the simple directive: go listen to other music, it’s out there waiting for you and it was made to appeal specifically to you.",

  "selftext": "What reason could one object to either of these if not purely on religious grounds? Disney movies with gay characters or queer couples aren’t any more “inappropriate” or less child-friendly than straight characters and couples just so long as both don’t go beyond kissing. First-term abortion is objectively *not* murder because the fetus at that point in time is scientifically not alive by *any* definition of the term seeing as how it’s not a fully formed organism and doesn’t even have half of it’s organs yet - it’s less alive than even an amoeba cell and surely no one sane would object to the “murder” of that would they?\n\nThe “Don’t Say Gay” bill and the overturning of Roe vs Wade aren’t based on any factual or universal scientific evidence, it’s not any more damaging to little kids to expose them to chaste LGBT content than to straight content, there is literally no meaningful difference between the two if we define “inappropriate for younger audiences” to mean sexually explicit or suggestive content and/or graphic violence. A fetus is not scientifically alive until it’s a fully formed organism with all it’s organs intact and that only happens at the 5 or 6 month mark, therefore conservatives attempts at pushing the censorship of queer kids romance and outlawing of abortion altogether on the general public is not founded on the universal values of not exposing kids to inappropriate content they can’t handle or being against murder, but their own *religious* beliefs on what constitutes “inappropriate subject matters” or “murder.” It is attempting to push their religion on the general American public and that’s not okay because it’s in direct violation of the First Amendment.\n\nWe already have objective criteria in place based on science for what constitutes as “not suitable for general audiences” and “the definition of a living human being/murder,” once you go beyond that and try to change those standards you’re entering into religious territory and the First Amendment is freedom for religion *and* from religion.

By \"ethical,\" I mean both parties have given informed consent and are not under any extreme financial or social pressure to perform acts they wouldn't normally consent to.   \n\n* Moderate porn use: Porn use that does not affect personal life (not socializing, missing work, spending excessive money, lying about porn use to S/O). I also do not believe minors can moderate porn use.  \n\n\nI also want to address some common arguments I've seen against pornography.  \n\n\n  1. Porn use often leads to ED (erectile dysfunction) and a poor sex life\n\n  \nI haven't seen many studies on this matter nor heard of any anecdotal stories where this wasn't correlated with another personal issue. I acknowledge that this is a possibility from excessive porn use, but I haven't seen anything that suggests moderate porn use can also cause ED. I would argue that those who experience ED or other physiological issues with porn simply do not know their \"limit,\" in the same fashion a person who vomits from drinking too much doesn't know their alcoholic limit/tolerance level.  \n\n\n 2.  Porn is extremely available and addictive. Excessive use can reprogram your brain pathways to crave porn.\n\nI acknowledge the truth of this statement, but I don't see how this is fundamentally different from video games, fast-food, romantic relationships, etc.   \n\n\n3. Porn cannot be made ethically and/or creates a culture of misogyny.  \n\n\nI don't really see how this applies anymore now that porn is such a vast genre. This was definitely true before, but now I feel like its more the exception than the rule. I would argue that those who become misogynistic because of porn either were already misogynistic or started watching porn at a young age.  \n\n\nTLDR; the dangers of porn are exaggerated. People need to treat it more like fast-food/alcohol and realize it's perfectly fine when done in moderation.  \n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n   \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n",

  "selftext": "To set the record straight, I consider myself to be more liberal than not. I am all for equality in any shape or form. I believe that there are genuine, systemic injustices that need to be righted. Race, gender, sex, and sexuality come to mind as areas with a long history of power imbalance, but I do not believe the current avenue is the correct path. As a disclaimer, my perspective comes as a straight white man with a middle-class upbringing. I posit that wokeism, while efficacious in outing injustices, is not productive in achieving equality.\n\nI truly do not believe that empowerment of one population requires disempowerment of another. In other words, for women and minorities to be elevated in society, it does not require tearing men down. Power is not fixed nor finite. Equality is not achieved by tipping the scales of justice in the opposite direction from what it's been. It is about *balance.* That means all parties must be considered. Perhaps this is where my argument is flawed. Maybe what I sense as \"disempowerment\" is my white privilege (which I acknowledge as a very real power imbalance in our society) being exposed and dismantled.\n\nOn that premise, it would appear that wokeism appears to be \"getting back\" at privileged white men.  I am only 21 years old and given the political climate I was born into, I have become very aware of these injustices, and I wish to contribute to the solution. But that effort has proved challenging.\n\nTake for instance the \"k\\*ll all men\" mantra. Does this include the men that are willing to work toward equality? Misandry does *not* eradicate misogyny. On several experiences at my university, I have felt disempowered due to my identity, with one colleague even posing the question \"How do I prevent only white men in my class from raising their hand and giving their opinion?\" Rather, shouldn't the question be \"How do I empower women and minorities to raise their hands and offer their opinion?\" Some might argue that now I know how it feels to be unfairly judged because of my identity, but what good does that achieve?\n\nI apologize for the terrible history that my race and sex has long upheld, but I make this post because I realize my perspective may be flawed and I want to be better. But this is a new generation with different values. Am I not allowed a seat at the table despite acknowledging injustice and a willingness to help?\n\nChange my view.\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for helping me clarify this stance. As /u/destro23 said, there is an expression that goes \"when you are used to privilege, equality feels like oppression.\" Perhaps my (old) view stems from the feelings that resemble that shift. I am okay with my privilege being subtracted if it means equality, but I did not realize the discomfort that would bring. Thank you for helping me rationalize these feelings.\n\nAs for \"wokeism,\" it would be appear that it is a term that has been co-opted by conservative media as a catch-all for any social or cultural shift they do not support. I had my suspicions about this, but thank you for providing necessary examples to prove this is as true. I will refrain from conflating that term with equality. \n\nConclusion: I should not dwell on the extremes of an ideology to be representative of the true, well-meaning intentions of a path toward more just and equal future. I truly did not mean to offend anyone with this post. Thank you for educating me and providing a crucial perspective on understanding the impacts of my privilege. \n\nCheers!",

  "selftext": "I think people are reflexively against the lab-leak hypothesis because it seems more conspiratorial, but are too over-confident in dismissing it. People need to take a Bayesian approach to this question. The origin of COVID-19 was three years ago, and subject to two layers of coverups - once by local Wuhan officials hiding their failures in Dec 2019, and then later by the Chinese central government. \n\nTo summarize US government agency positions from this [WSJ article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-origin-china-lab-leak-807b7b0a): \n\nFBI thinks lab leak w/ \"moderate confidence\"\n\nDOE thinks lab leak w/ \"low confidence\"\n\nCIA and another Unnamed agency is undecided between two theories\n\nNational Intelligence Council + four unnamed agencies thinks animal transmission w/ \"low confidence\"\n\nThe agencies at most moderately confident and they are split. \n\nIn terms of publicly available information:\n\nIn favor of animal transmission:\n\n* Animal transmission is historically where all diseases came from \n\nIn favor of lab leak:\n\n* There is a lab in Wuhan where it could have come from, and they were working in the area of coronaviruses\n* There have been many cases of [lab leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laboratory_biosecurity_incidents) in the past (and since!)\n* Labs are a new invention compared to the entire history of human-animal interactions, so history isn't the best judge\n* There has yet to be a clearly established animal link unlike other novel diseases (like SARS or MERS)\n*  The disease predates the outbreak at the [wet market](https://www.science.org/content/article/wuhan-seafood-market-may-not-be-source-novel-virus-spreading-globally), weakening the animal leak. \n\nNotice how the arguments in favor of lab leak are mostly rebuttals to the idea that it is definitely animal transmission, but aren't definitive themselves either. \n\nThe Chinese government suppressed scientists trying to raise the alarm of covid existing. They've since resisted making investigation of the origin of COVID easy. I think they don't want any evidence of their initial poor handling (in December of 2019) of covid to come to light, or the possibility of a lab leak to come to light (I would guess they also don't know conclusively either). The coverup doesn't mean it is a lab leak - there are non-lab leak reasons for the Chinese coverup, it just means we can't know for sure. \n\nThe information available to us as the public don't point definitely one way or another. The US government, which has experts and also spies etc also don't point definitely one way or another. There is a good chance we never know for sure. We shouldn't dismiss lab leak as a conspiracy theory. Sometimes conspiracies are true, and in this case the the conspiracy is ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯ might be true, might not be.",

  "selftext": "If you're going to downvote, be kind enough to leave a comment so I know why. I'm open to changing my view.\n\nI don't believe a lot of the fatigue around Taylor Swift has to do with the person. After all, as a grown adult, she's entitled to enjoy a football game and cheer on her partner, like the rest of us.\n\nThe fatigue that I, and many of us are feeling are not directed at Taylor Swift the person, but the cottage industry that's been promoted by the NFL around the brand of Taylor Swift - two separate entities.\n\nI'm not complaining about the 30 seconds of airtime they give Taylor every Chiefs game. We've seen attention given to celebrities at sports events since I can remember.\n\nSpike Lee is prominently featured at Knicks games. Those old enough to remember the infamous battle he had on the sidelines with Reggie Miller understand how sports and celebrity merge into a melting pot of entertainment.\n\nDuring the 2018-19 basketball playoffs, we witnessed Drake coaching a team from the sidelines, giving hi-fives and pep talks to members of the Toronto Raptors, and yelling at coach Nick Nurse to put players in rotation as they won their championship.\n\nI didn't have a problem with any of that then - I don't have a problem with it now.\n\nThe issue, as I see it, is where these lines begin and end.\n\nWhereas with these previous examples, I was happy to partake in the pageantry that was those celebrity x sports moments, but I expected them to go no further than the end of the game. Maybe a spot or two on ESPN where replays are shown, and Drake highlights from these games.\n\nBut ever since Taylor showed up to her first Chiefs game to support Travis Kelce, there has been an entire sub-industry built around that, that bleeds into unexpected parts of the sports ecosystem.\n\nCase-in-point, within an hour of the Chiefs beating the Ravens, I received an Apple news alert that there was a way that Taylor could make it to the Superbowl from her Eras tour in Japan.\n\nI tune into my favorite fantasy football program and watch a 62-year-old man wearing a Taylor Swift t-shirt, breaking out into a segment where he is schooling the younger members on set on how to be a better swifty. Things that would seem, as the kids put it, 'creepy' and 'awkward' are now mainstream.\n\nI tune into a sports caster's show and have to sit through a lecture stating that if I have any objections to Taylor Swift, I am a misogynist loser and I don't have any strong women around me.\n\nAs if Taylor needed a bunch of middle-aged guys to come to her rescue.\n\nThese types of arguments might have some merit if these sports pundits throwing judgment weren't gaining financially from their speech. If they didn't look at the numbers and realize that the industry around Taylor Swift is good for their bottom line.\n\nUnfortunately, this has done nothing but once again polarize the country - you're either a swifty, flags out riding high, or you're a cave-dwelling ogre that has no place in society. When in reality, most of us sane people that may feel fatigued are not objecting to Taylor the person - we're objecting to the consequences of the rampant exploitation of her name.\n\nThe same sports league that blackballed Colin Kaepernick for being too political - hurting their money - is now welcoming this cottage industry that to them, makes sense on paper. If that's not hypocrisy, I don't know what is.\n\nBut don't take my word for it - Travis Kelce, who is as close to the situation as one can get, also says that [the NFL is overdoing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P32_Y7xKb-E) when it comes to Taylor's brand.\n\n&#x200B;",

People travel miles into the city to get to work, or telecommunicate hundreds of miles for a paycheck. Some of us work for large corporations that employ thousands nationwide, that have boom and bust cycles of employment; dishelving thousands of families. We eat hormone-induced food grown hundred of miles away and sold in large conglomerate food institutions; farmed by almost enslaved culture groups on peanut-low wages for hard work.\n\nEverything about today is on a macro-level. We live in a society where everything is essentially outsourced; from food, work, entertainment, home/auto repairs, beauty/health, education, and so on.\n\nSpecialization of work is ok, as it allows folks to focus on one thing and do it well. The only problem is it makes you more replaceable and essentially a cog in the machinery that can easily be replaced with a backup (or cheaper backup at that). Hence, why pay wages haven't keep foot with inflation and why we have so many employment issues domestically. \n\n**My Thesis is simple:** let's shrink the scale at which we operate, and go back to small village style of subsistence living where everything is made or produced for the few hundred living there.

Another example was Chernobyl, if there wasn't so much covering up of mistakes, it might not have been such a big tragedy.\n\nMy proposed punishment is economic tariffs, a fine, or similar economic punishment. A country would have to report and own up to their mistake or face economic setbacks. I think the punishment should be on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSpecifically for China, I think they should be punished through harsh environmental regulations. Currently they are the #1 contributors to CO2 emissions. This would solve two problems at once, set an example so other countries are less likely to cover up anything that would negatively affect the whole world *and* lower global co2 emissions at the same time.

  "title": "CMV: In General, Dating For Bi People Would Be Better if Same Sex Relationships Were More Common",
  "selftext": "Overall, I think people under the bi umbrella would be much happier dating people of the same sex rather than the opposite sex. This is for several reasons, including\n\n1) Men and women typically look for different things in a relationship. Women tend to be more romantic than men while men tend to be more sexual than women. Again, this is only in general and there are obviously romantic men and sexual women, but this means that in most cases dating for people of the opposite sex, both people are approaching the relationship from different perspectives. Women want men with humor and confidence, who will care for them and act romantically towards them, but many men do not view relationships in the same light. This is why on dating subreddits you always see men complaining about the high standards women want for a relationship and women complaining about how men are unable to satisfy those standards. \n\n2) Men and women like different things. For example, men tend to like sports, cars, and gaming while women like shopping, movies, and novels. That's why it's easier for men to bond over similar interests, and the same for women. However, there is greater anxiety for opposite sex dating because there is a significant chance none of your interests will overlap and that emotional connection that is necessary for a relationship just won't be there. You care more about not messing up and the 'act' of dating, which makes it hard to have a good time.\n\n3) There are no sexist expectations in a same sex relationship like there would be in an opposite sex relationship. While sexism has decreased dramatically, there are still expectations that can put pressure in people of opposite sex who are dating. For example, the man is expected to earn a higher salary than the woman, and many women still want the man to pay on dates. It is ok for a man to have a large number of previous partners, but not ok for a woman. People complain about these issues a lot in dating communities, however, in a same sex relationship, these types of problems wouldn't really exist.\n\nThe point of this post isn't to say same sex relationships are better, but that they are (in general) easier. Most people are straight, in which this post wouldn't really be relevant but for people who are bi/heteroflexible, I think they would have an easier time dating the same sex rather than the opposite sex.",

Hawley comments inline with my comments: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVew6MC3-KE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVew6MC3-KE) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPoints:\n\n1. **War Efficacy: Ukraine is not going to win this war by their outlined criteria.** Ukraine seeks to reunify their pre-2014 lands. Ukraine does not have the capital (economic, human, etc) or strategic initiative to win back those lands. Its not only unlikely, its unrealistic.\n2. (Assoc. #1) **It’s unethical to continue fighting a losing war** (set by your own criteria) to build a better negotiating platform. People die in war. Ukrainian defense officials have been quoted as saying the current efforts are to build a better negotiation standing. No life is worth throwing away for a negotiation. Moral Law: “*The moral law cannot require us to sacrifice others, or ourselves, because to do so would be to treat persons as a means only, rather than as a free and equal..*”\n3. **Local Sentiment:** \"Ukrainians\" in **those occupied areas prefer Russia to Europe by measuring votes of feet.** Over 2+ million Ukrainians fled to Russia while only 100K people fled to Europe at the start of the war. Caveat: This marker will be difficult to study today. Violence (the war), economic incentives, and difficulties of travel have changed travel patterns.\n4. **Local Sentiment** (Continued): **Most of the local people in the occupied areas prefer Russia.** Much of the people there have ethnic, historical, and/or economic ties or they just outright prefer Russia. Many Ukrainians in the occupied areas have Russian passports. Russian is the dominant language. As a sample of Russian support, follow the Instagram posts of places in Russia-occupied areas (Crimea, Donbas, etc.).\n5. **Historical context: The land now held has a huge argument for Russian control.** One of the lands, Crimea, was historically Russian and was only given to Ukrainian administrative control while these places were both USSR states. After the fall of the USSR, Crimea pushed for independence and closer ties with Russia.\n6. **Reasons for Funding:** The US is pumping Defense dollars into a proxy war to weaken an adversary rather than for moral reasons. Most Americans don’t care or know about Russia other than “they’re our enemies,” “lots of nukes,” and/or “socialist.” A very small minority of Americans even tracked the 2014 conflict between Ukraine and Russia. I don’t support continued wars, particularly when they’re a passive competitor on the international stage.\n7. **The amount already invested in Ukraine is staggering.** Almost $80 billion in foreign aide to Ukraine (!). In a standard fiscal year, the US spends $750 billion in national defense...\n\nIf you agree to the above, then there are other roles that the West can play in negotiations. They can remove Russia from the UN Security Council. They can sanction Russian oligarchs. Etc.\n\n—**Things that won’t CMV:**A. Russia is <insert political classification with negative connotation>/un-free! Disagree: most of the world is “un-free” but the West doesn’t fund proxy wars against those nations. Recent Examples: Sudan, Ethiopia, Niger.B. Ukraine should decide when the war is over! Disagree: if Ukraine didn’t have Western funding then their government would cease to operate. Ukraine is currently operating and fighting exclusively on Western funds.",

  "title": "CMV: The Death Penalty is wrong, and always has been.",
  "selftext": "Background: I’m a 20-something man in Australia, where the death penalty has been abolished since before I was born.\n\nOpinion clarification: The death penalty is morally wrong, should be abolished in every state/justice system, and should never have been instituted in humankind’s history. (Note that I am not advocating time travel)\n\nMy personal arguments for my opinion:\n\n#1: Innocence. This is, in any approach to the topic, the most powerful argument against capital punishment imo. Even if we granted that it’s ok to execute the guilty, the fact is that it’s not possible for humans to determine with 100% certainty that someone is guilty of a crime. Has never been possible, will never be possible. The danger of even one innocent person being killed by the justice system invalidates the whole thing right away. Of course innocent people going to prison is plenty bad but this can at least be *somewhat* compensated; life has the chance to go on, death is final.\n\n#2: Rights. Human beings do not have the right to take another life. This is a weaker argument because I admit it’s based on a personal belief system, but it goes like this. Human beings have to exist within the same moral framework. If it’s wrong to kill, it’s wrong in all circumstances, whether it’s cold blooded murder, execution, or warfare. There’s some wiggle room when it comes to things like accidents, self-defence etc but that’s outside the scope I think.\n\nPre-rebuttal against common reasons for the death penalty:\n\n#1: [Some people deserve death] Maybe they do! If you asked me if Hitler deserved death, I’d say probably yeah. But do I have the right to make that decision? No. Does anyone have the right? No. There’s a difference between making a moral judgement as to what would be someone’s “just desserts” and actually giving it to them. Humans shouldn’t have the ability to kill, neither should governments.\n\n#2: [It’s a deterrent] Putting aside any data on the matter, and I’ve reason to believe the data is at best inconclusive, this goes into the utilitarian aspects of punishment, which don’t speak to my reasons against, but I’ll still engage on these terms. We imagine criminals as being deterred by the threat of what could happen to them , but it’s not threatening them with what *will* happen, it’s threatening with what *might* happen. Someone willing to risk life in prison is probably also willing to risk death because *they don’t plan on getting caught.* If anything they’ll likely go to more extreme measures not to get caught e.g. murdering witnesses etc. Willing to concede this is probably not great rebuttal since I can’t claim to know how all criminals think.\n\n#3: [It provides closure for victims/families] This argument always feels disingenuous. A few things: One, victims families (afaik) don’t get a say in the punishment in the justice systems I’m aware of. Their desire to end or spare the criminals life has no bearing on the judge, and in many cases families of murder victims are vocally opposed to capital punishment for the offender. Not to mention the guilt if that family changes their mind and are forced to live with death on their conscience. At any rate, revenge hardly seems a healthy way to cope with loss. Another rebuttal I’m somewhat sympathetic to: What about the killer’s family? Do they deserve to never see their loved one alive again? Even if the killer deserves it, there seems to be a lot of emotional collateral damage to consider.\n\n#4: [Death penalty saves money/stops overcrowding etc] This argument is downright ghoulish and I’ll come out and say you have a hell of an uphill battle changing my mind on this. I don’t care if it saves money or whatever. A functioning society has to be able to make material sacrifices in order to do the right thing. Justice isn’t a business.\n\nAnyway, there’s my position and reasons. I’ll do my best to be purely logical, but it’s clear that some part of this is coming from a place of pathos.",

And the fact that kids are being subjected to this can be really damaging to their health. \n\nThere are a couple of points I would like to address obviously: the first would be for places far North like Alaska, where it would be impossible to otherwise fit a full day of classes between sunrise and sundown, as during the winter the sun will barely even be up, if at all. Obviously here they would have no choice but to start before sunrise and end after sundown. But for any other place in the lower 48 states, this shouldn’t be an issue. \n\nThe other point to address is that this rule is simply for the school’s bell schedule. Before-school and after-school activities should not be included here, as during the winter months especially, there’s simply not enough hours where the sun is up to fit them in. It’s simply from the first bell to the last bell of the day. \n\nBut yeah, otherwise, I feel it would be perfectly reasonable to expect schools to set their bell schedule based on when sunrise and sunset are. We already have the tools to know when the Sun will rise and set at any point in the year. Each school district should be expected to check when the Sun would rise and set on December 21st, the shortest day of the year, and set their bells based on those times. Again, the only exception would be Alaska. \n\nAnyway, perhaps I’m missing something, so I’m open to hearing arguments why this shouldn’t be illegal. Your argument would have to include a point about a potential benefit to starting before sunrise/ending after sunset and/or a potential drawback of limiting school to take place between sunrise and sunset.\n\nEDIT: \n\nAlready replied to a lot of people on here and kind of burnt out so won’t be answering much more tonight but some main points I was seeing that I want to address:\n\n1. A lot of people are talking the Northern band of the lower 48 states. My response to that is that in Seattle, WA, the Sun rises on Dec. 21st, the shortest day of the year, at 7:54, and sets at 4:20. Being that the school day is typically only about 7 hours long, you can easily make school between 8 and 3 and be absolutely fine. So I don’t see an issue with this. Even if this was an issue with the northern band of the lower 48, my proposed law is a federal law, that can make exceptions for ANY place where there isn’t enough hours of sunlight in the day. Although those places should fit as much of the school day during sun hours as possible. \n\n2. A lot of comments mentioning how I’m not being consistent with enforcing this for extracurriculars. While there’s enough sun hours to fit the entire school day in most places, there’s not enough Sun hours for extracurriculars as well. In the winter, the sun typically sets around 5 in many places in the US. Extracurricular activities are also highly variable in when they end, as well as often requiring cooperation from multiple schools for things like sports thus it would be difficult to enforce/say who’s at fault if the rule was broken. However, it is very easy to enforce it for class times as those are not variable at all, don’t rely on other school districts, and are equitable for all students within the same school district. \n\nHow my view has been changed: the points I have awarded deltas for were points along the lines of how starting before sunrise is often a bussing/transportation/scheduling issue, and how starting after sunrise could make that matter worse for families as it wouldn’t align with work schedules. \n\n",

  "title": "CMV: The Problem of Evil, when taken to refer to moral evil, does not eliminate the possibility of God’s existence.",
  "selftext": "In order for me to explain my view I want to start with some definitions. Firstly, moral evil vs. natural evil. Natural evil is evil for which no non-divine agent can be held morally responsible for its occurrence. Moral evil is evil caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent.   \nThe Problem of Evil is the idea that it is either logically impossible or extremely unlikely for an omnipotent, omniscient, and morally good God to exist and also allow evil to exist. Obviously, this is because if God was truly all powerful and good, he could and therefore would eliminate evil. Therefore, the Problem of Evil posits that it is likely the God we believe to be all powerful and good, may be not one of those two characteristics, and so the traditional God, as viewed by many Christians and Muslims religions doesn’t truly exist. On the other hand, there is the proposal that God does not exist at all because if God is a perfect being, then therefore the existence of Evil proves that God isn’t real because it would inherently not exist in compatibility with God.   \n\\*\\*IF AT THIS POINT you disagree with anything I’ve written, or you think I have a misinterpretation of the Problem of Evil, keep in mind that I’m laying out the premise which I will soon reject, so this hopefully isn’t the part of the post you are trying to disprove\\*\\*  \nI believe that the Free Will defense fully protects God against non-existence.   \nThe Free Will Defense argues that God realized that Free Will/Free Choice/Free Moral Choice was more valuable than intrinsic goodness in the world itself.   \nFirst I will explain 1) how this connects to evil , then I will explain 2) why Free Will is more valuable than inherent goodness in the world.  \nThe Free Will Defense states that you cannot have true free will without also having the ability to act both rightly and wrongly.   \nThis is because we can observe how some of the time, people will act in evil ways out of their own free will, so if people did not have the moral choice to act evilly, this would not be true free will.  \nFree Will is tied to the amount of moral choice one has.   \nGoodness is one moral, yet by definition it must be contextualized with other morals. Morals are “concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior”. Therefore, without the ability to choose between behaviors, morals fade into non-existence.  \nThis poses the question, is the non-existence of both good and evil better than the existence of both concepts? The preclusion of one negative concept would eliminate free will and true choice between moral options, which God obviously encompasses due to his perfect nature.   \n\t  \nI’m writing this at 3am, will post it tomorrow so I can sufficiently respond to people’s arguments. Thanks!  \n\nEdit: I should have made the distinction, but I believe in Libertarianism free will, not compatibilism\n\nEdit 2: the closest argument to changing my mind is the one which states that physical existence itself, which is created by God, restricts our Free Will. My response is that we as humans currently have the maximum possible free will, proven by the existence of evil. The ability to fly would not be a change in moral choice, it would be a change in the definition of “human”. Free Will refers to our ability to exercise choice within our existence, particularly in the sense that we can choose between good and evil. The fact that we cannot fly is not a feasible choice to be made, it would be a change in state of being.\n\nEdit 3: awarded delta because its difficult to argue about the extent to which free will is restricted and the totality of the of existence of morals, particularly since this is operating under the impression that god created everything. I agree that the free will defense cannot explain why god limited humans via physical existence and hadn’t thought about that previously. I’m going to keep responding to comments though. \n\nEdit 4: awarded delta because I agree that the Free Will defense fails to explain that if moral evil did exist with humans on earth it would logically make sense that it existed with them in heaven, meaning that after death they are either restricted in their existence in heaven or god is not all powerful because he cannot enforce the very ideal by which he let the humans into heaven.\n",

  "title": "CMV: The US should repeal the 17th Amendment",
  "selftext": "Pretty much the title. This is an opinion I've had for a while but never had a serious discussion on it, and political science isn't my forte, so hoping to see some strong counterarguments.\n\n**Background**: When the US Constitution was ratified, it included provisions for Senators to be elected by state legislatures. As I learned it in college PoliSci, the Senate--which would ideally be composed of persons more learned in statecraft and more educated, and represent the interests of the states as political entities--was supposed to act as a counterweight to the House of Representatives--which would ideally be composed of persons more representative of the actual US population, and represent the interests of the people themselves. The 17th Amendment altered this so that senators were elected directly by the people, just as those in the House of Representatives are.\n\n**My View**: As I see it, because the people elected those sitting on the state legislatures, the Senate would not be too far removed from the people and the interests of the people, but the fact senators reported to the state legislatures, and not the people directly, meant they had a vested interest in limiting the power of the federal government so as to maximize state power, thereby helping to reduce tyranny. They were not beholden to pleasing the people directly, and their longer tenure (6 years, vs. 2 for the House) meant that the Senate could act as a check against novel ideas that might enjoy brief bouts of popularity but become unpopular relatively quickly, leading to a more stable government that enacted fewer short-lived and self-defeating policies.\n\nThe 17th Amendment removed an important check on federal power and transformed the Senate into a slightly different version of the House. I believe that this is one of the key reasons that the federal government is so bloated now: There has been a lack of real accountability from federal institutions, except when other federal institutions do something about it, which in many cases amounts to asking a bunch of powerful people with similar interests, questionable morals, and no oversight nor accountability to abide by the honor system. Moreover, because the Senate is elected in the same manner as the House, the same political developments that affect the House affects the Senate in the same way. So, as laws and Supreme Court decisions (e.g., Citizens United) have allowed politicians to be more easily controlled by corporations and moneyed special interests, it has affected both the House and the Senate equally, and there's no capacity for one to act as a check on the other.\n\nI'm sure there were problems with the Senate, which is why the 17th Amendment passed in the first place, but I have a hard time imagining that it would be worse than the current, directly elected version.\n\n**Known Counterarguments:** The only argument I've ever seen in favor of the 17th Amendment is that it is more democratic, as if maximizing the amount of direct democracy in a government is an inherent good. I think this is problematic. People are riddled with cognitive biases that can be exploited, and modern politicians take full advantage of this. Democracy is valuable because it gives the average person some voice and influence in the workings of government, which is vital, but pure democracy is essentially mob rule. The House of Representatives was the (vital) mechanism in Congress that allowed for direct representation, and it was sufficient by itself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EDIT**: Thank you all who replied. I've replied to as many posts as I can right now, which isn't many. I'll try to get to this again later. I think so far the most convincing argument I've seen is related to issues with gerrymandering, and how the current Senate isn't affected but state legislatures are. I think this is a valid concern and one I hadn't considered.\n\nA few have also pointed out other reasons for the 17th: Corruption in senate elections (i.e., senators buying Senate seats) and deadlocking of elections. So far the only sources cited for this I've seen has been Wikipedia, and the article [points out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Issues) that relatively recent political analysts have claimed concerns about corruption were overblown and that only 10 Senate elections were contested in 100 years, and that deadlocks were relatively rare, temporary, and were becoming more rare as state governments matured. Assuming these are true, these seem like insufficient reasons to change the method of Senate election rather than, say, reinforcing rules against purchasing seats, etc.",

  "title": "CMV: Economics is mostly \"Religionomics\"",
  "selftext": "**TL;DR**: People, including many economists, base their economic beliefs on their personal beliefs instead of evidence.[1]\n\nBackground: I went to college to be an economist. My first two years, I took every economics class available[2] in a program designed to prepare me for an undergraduate economics major. I wound up going into software engineering instead, though I still love economics.\n\nWhat finally drove me over the edge was a professor making an impassioned argument that [the 1972 collapse of the Peruvian anchovy harvest was actually one of the major causes of stagflation in the US](https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2009/march/agricultural-commodity-price-spikes-in-the-1970s-and-1990s-valuable-lessons-for-today/). While it was a factor (it impacted cattle feed prices), such narrow focus on a minor topic doesn't help us understand the bigger picture.\n\nIn years of reading multiple papers and articles on economics, what I stumbled across, again and again, were bold assertions presented as fact, with little to no evidence to support them. \"Government intervention always makes things worse.\" \"Private industry is always corrupt.\" \"X is always/never Y.\" (This is maddeningly common in Libertarian papers). These faith-based comments, of course, show up routinely on the news when pundits are invited, often with derisive laughter for those who disagree with their unqualified assertions.\n\nEven in straightforward discussion, such as whether and how we should provide money for children in poverty, we get bogged down in discussions about \"right\" and \"wrong\", but rarely do people cite evidence for outcomes. Often, when I cite evidence from a non-US country, the response is, \"they're nothing like the US, so it's not a fair comparison.\" That, of course, shuts down all debate because you could use a variant of that for _any_ discussion. (\"Texas isn't like California, so we can't compare 'em.\")\n\nWhat I eventually realized was that people's views on economics weren't based on optimal outcomes. They were based on their value systems. Specifically, many economic policies have a trade-off between efficiency and fairness. On the large scale, that could be the difference between Libertarianism and Communism.\n\nOn a smaller scale, such as aid for children in poverty, we could go with maximum efficiency: give parents money, no questions asked. Or we could go for maximum fairness: do the children exist? How old are they? Means testing? Does the parent have custody? What's the local cost of living? Visit the children to verify everything. And so on. Going to either extreme of maximum fairness or efficiency seems to lead to potential breakdowns, which is why evidence-based outcomes need to be considered, but they're not.\n\nMany modern economists (Stiglitz, Krugman, Varoufakis, etc.) _do_ present evidence, but it often feels stilted, like they have a point of view and they're bringing up evidence for it (to be fair, when writing for a news site, it's hard to be well-rounded; I should read more of their actual papers).\n\nEconomic systems seem to largely be a trade-off between efficiency and fairness and which economic policies one supports seem to depend on your personal values, rather than evidence. I rarely see this trade-off explicitly discussed, even though it's at the core of so many disagreements.\n\nMuch of modern economic discussion, therefore, comes from those with the shining eyes of the converted, rather than an analysis of likely evidence-based outcomes. I also saw this routinely in my economics professors, often arguing for free trade and supporting laissez-faire capitalism, rather than presenting a well-rounded set of opinions.\n\nHence, \"religionomics\" rather than economics.\n\n---\n\n1. TLDRs need to be at the top, not the bottom. There's a reason scientific papers include the abstract before the main body of work: how can you know if you want to read it if you have to spend too much time figuring out the thesis?\n2. Not true: I skipped a self-study advanced class where I needed to write an economic thesis. Mine was to be on the externalities of government regulation of illicit markets, a topic I'm rather passionate about. Taking the class would have delayed my graduation one semester, but if anyone can provide links to great papers on the topic, I'd love to have 'em.",

  "selftext": "I’ve never really cared about happiness as a measure of life’s wellbeing, however recently I started to noticing that many people over glorify its’ importance as a truism.\n\n I’ve noticed plenty of articles, group discussions and polls trying to paint happiness as something to base owns own life decisions on. And I guess this is not new since I’ve come to learn even ancient philosophies are pretty defined by their answering how to live a happy life.\n\nPersonally, I find this bemusing. Happiness is an unquantifiable emotional state which makes it a horrible metric to base one’s life decisions on. It’s too vague, precarious and unproductive to be a goal worth achieving. At best it should be seen as a by product of other endeavors, but not a goal in itself.\n\nPeople should base their major choices and goals on being productive or simply attaining virtues. These are much better goals because they are measurable and quantifiable. Being a productive worker, citizen, family man, role model, etc… any of these are superior to happiness.\n\nTherefore, my view is that happiness isn’t really a good goal or purpose to life and people drop it. And instead choose from plenty of the more preferable, actionable alternatives. Now change my view and tell me why I’m wrong!",

  "selftext": "I am very willing and open to change my mind on this. First of all I feel like this is kind of a privileged take that some people have without actually living in an area with a large homeless population.\n\nWell I live in a town with an obscene homeless population, one of the largest in America. \n\nAnti homeless architecture does not reflect how hard a city is trying to help their homeless people. Some cities are super neglectful and others aren’t. But regardless, the architecture itself isn’t the problem. I know that my city puts tons of money into homeless shelters and rehabilitation, and that the people who sleep on the public benches are likely addicted to drugs or got kicked out for some other reason. I agree 100% that it’s the city’s responsibility to aid the homeless.\n\nBut getting angry at anti homeless architecture seems to imply that these public benches were made for homeless people to sleep on…up until recently, it was impossible to walk around downtown without passing a homeless person on almost every corner, and most of them smelled very strongly of feces. But we’ve begun to implement anti homeless architecture and the changes to our downtown have been unbelievable. We can actually sit on the public benches now, there’s so much less litter everywhere, and the entire downtown area is just so much more vibrant and welcoming. I’m not saying that I don’t care about the homeless people, but there’s a time and place.\n\n\nEdit: Wow. I appreciate the people actually trying to change my view, but this is more towards the people calling me a terrible person and acting as if I don’t care about homeless people…\n\nFirst of all my friends and I volunteer regularly at the homeless shelters.\nIf you actually listen to what I’m saying, you’ll realize that I’m not just trying to get homeless people out of sight and out of mind. My point is that public architecture is a really weird place to have discourse about homeless people.\n\n“I lock my door at night because I live in a high crime neighborhood.”\n\n- “Umm, why? It’s only a high crime neighborhood because your city is neglectful and doesn’t help the people in the neighborhood.”\n\n“Okay? So what? I’m not saying that I hate poor people for committing more crime…I’m literally just locking my door. The situations of the robbers doesn’t change the fact that I personally don’t want to be robbed.”\n\n\n\nEDIT #2\n\nThe amount of privilege and lack of critical thinking is blowing my mind. I can’t address every single comment so here’s some general things. \n\n1. “Put the money towards helping homelessness instead!” \n\nPublic benches are a fraction of the price. Cities already *are* putting money towards helping the homeless. The architecture price is a fart in the wind. Ironically, it’s the same fallacy as telling a homeless person “why are you buying a phone when you should be buying a house?”\n\n2. Society is punishing homeless people and trying to make it impossible for them to live.\n\nWrong. It’s not about punishing homeless people, it’s about making things more enjoyable for non homeless people. In the same way that prisons aren’t about punishing the criminals, they are about protecting the non criminals. (Or at least, that’s what they *should* be about.)\n\n3. “They have no other choice!”\n\nI’m sorry to say it, but this just isn’t completely true. And it’s actually quite simple: homelessness is bad for the economy, it does not benefit society in any way. It’s a net negative for everyone. So there’s genuinely no reason for the government *not* to try and help homeless people.\n\nBecause guess what? Homeless people are expensive. A homeless person costs the government 50k dollars a year. If a homeless person wants to get off the streets, it’s in the gov’s best interest to do everything they can to help. The government is genuinely desperate to end homelessness, and they have no reason NOT to be. This is such a simple concept. \n\nAnd once again, if y’all had any *actual* interactions with homeless people, you would realize that they aren’t just these pity parties for you to fetishize as victims of capitalism. They are real people struggling with something that prevents them from getting help. The most common things I’ve seen are drug abuse and severe mental illness. The PSH housing program has a 98% rehabilitation rate. The people who are actually committing to getting help are receiving help.",

The risk of addiction and potential long term consequences could be justified when you're so unhappy and causing so much trouble that you feel like you can barely control.\n\nWith puberty blockers I feel that what a lot of parents and doctors are considering is the high suicide rate. Nobody can deny that the suicide rate for trans youth is *much* higher than their peers and that comes after risk of developing depression as well which you could be prescribed antidepressants for, another laundry list of medications with it's own side effects, complications and long term consequences to consider, but one that notably no one is worried about prescribing to the youth. \n\nIf someone told me I had to choose between my child becoming depressed and being at a significantly increased risk of self self harm and suicide or starting them on a new medication that'll cause decreased bone density, other detrimental side effects like insomnia, fatigue and mood shifts as well as potential (but unlikely) long term consequences, I might be a little conflicted but in my opinion those consequences are worth it to reduce my childs risk of suicide. \n\nI don't see anyone talking about puberty blockers in this way, all I see is \"it causes chemical castration\" from people who don't understand what the term \"chemical castration\" even means and just think it sounds scary, \"it decreases bone density\" while conveniently ignoring the instructions from doctors to counteract that decrease in bone density, and \"it's permanently changing yoru body\" which is just a lie. If people are really concerned with the side effects, why aren't they more worried about things like Adderall being prescribed to kids? How many kids developed an addiction and OD'd or grew up and had to go to rehab, got arrested for selling the drugs, etc. people just ignore that despite it being a similar problem that they supposedly care about. The only reason I can think of is that these people are either just too stupid to think of anything the TV doesn't tell them to be scared of or they just hate trans people and don't actually care about the things they say they care about, they just want trans people to stop existing.",

I'm a professional 3D artist, and I've come to believe that almost all teaching about \"color theory\" is misguided.\n\nThe way I see it, there are three flavors of color theory:\n\n1. Color psychology\n2. Color harmonies\n3. Color space\n\nI think color psychology is an absolute pseudoscience. Color harmonies are impressively misunderstood. *Color space is fine. I have no problem with actual color science.*\n\n**Color psychology:**\n\n**Tl;dr: it's too easy to make an image that doesn't fit its colors' \"meanings\"**\n\nThe belief that an artist can communicate various concepts or emotions with their choice of color. It's usually communicated as \"blue is professional, orange is energetic,\" and the like. You'll find tables online giving you the list of meanings of colors.\n\nTwo problems:\n\n1. It's exceedingly easy to make a picture communicate all the wrong things according to its color psychology. As an experiment, I sampled a bunch of words often associated with blue, and made a picture using absolutely no blue.  \nTranquility, cleanliness: [A still lake in the sunset.](https://imgur.com/dTBa8Qe)  \nFreedom: [Open space](https://imgur.com/ulHoEnF).  \nFreshness: [Lush vegetation](https://imgur.com/zy17EVN).  \nStability: [A castle](https://imgur.com/ALEtNyd).  \nAuthority, wisdom, sadness: [A somber old wizard](https://imgur.com/SQ5tAsf).  \nAnd all the while, it was sore easy to avoid the concepts associated with my primary colors, orange and green: Orange: Youth, health, danger. Green: Prosperity, health, envy, corruption.\n2. There are obviously connotations to different colors, but those are idiosyncratic to individuals and to cultures. It is not possible to say beforehand what association your audience will have with your color choices. That is unless you pick something unnatural. Blood will always be red, so if you paint green blood, it will look strange, and you can bank on your audience thinking it's strange.\n\n**Color harmonies:**\n\n**Tl;dr: Images that don't follow them can be beautiful, and images that do can be ugly**\n\nColor harmonies are specific relationships of hues on the color wheel. There are many claims online about these, and I find most of them dubious, so it's hard to recount them faithfully. But I'll try.\n\nPeople seem to say that the established schemes (triadic, analogous, complementary, etc.) simply \"look good\" together. Patently false. It's so easy to make them look terrible together that it's hard to fathom how this argument ever gained any foothold. It's also easy to make a color scheme that looks nice and *isn't* an established harmony on the wheel.\n\nSome people say that they communicate different emotions. Complementary, for instance, has \"tension,\" since the colors are opposite each other on the wheel. Problem here is, people can't seem to agree on the emotion they convey. I also find sources stating that complementary schemes are \"naturally pleasant.\"\n\nAnd when people analyze classical paintings and movies, they seem to always miss something very important: There are millions of colors on the screen. When you look at a vectorscope (a color wheel where every pixel is plotted,) you'll almost always find that the image doesn't neatly fit into any scheme. It's usually all over the place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love see what benefits people actually get from color theory. Bring it on! Help me learn.",

  "title": "CMV: Stealing from a large corporation isn't more ethical than stealing from a locally owned business",
  "selftext": "There seems to be a fairly common consensus in society that stealing from large chains is either ok or much better than stealing from a smaller locally owned business. Most of the reasons given to justify this are fairly invalid.\n\nThe first reason given is that the company is large so they can afford it. This reason is pretty foolish because while a larger company has more profits they also have more stores to be stolen from so the theft essentially scales with the business. Also most local business would also still be profitable to some extent if people stole from them.\n\nThe second reason given is that the company is owned by rich people. While some retail companies for example Loblaws in Canada or Walmart have billionaires with large ownership stakes this is often not the case. Most large retailers are publically traded companies that are mostly owned by fairly normal people who buy index funds in their retirement accounts or by other groups like pension funds. If you took the median beneficial owner of a large retailer they probably wouldn't be much wealthier than the average small retailer owner.\n\nIn a similar justification people often bring up the CEOs pay but this also isn't relevant. They say things like \"if the company can afford to pay the CEO $20 million they can afford for me to take a loaf of bread\". This year Target expects to lose $1.2 billion to theft which is far greater than the CEOs pay which is probably in the $20-30 million range. Also shareholders have to pay a lot out in executive compensation to get people who are qualified to run such a large company in a role that often has low job security and a lot of scrutiny. It can be argued that CEOs as a whole are overpaid but there is little that an individual firm can do about this anyway.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the fact that large businesses are often more important to their customers meaning that stealing from them could have a worse community impact than stealing from a small business. From my experience small retailers these days are often involved in specialty discretionary products like Jewelery, art, comics or home furnishings while large retailers are more likely to be groceries or pharmacies. In cities like Chicago stealing from Walmart got so bad that they decided to close many stores and this created a food desert for many people as well as making it more difficult to get prescriptions. It is also important to consider the impact on staff and the broader community as well as the ownership of the business.",

  "selftext": "Between 1822 and 1861, more than 15,000 freed and freeborn African Americans migrated to West Africa, and founded the nation of Liberia. Their reasoning was quite sympathetic: African Americans had been ripped from their homeland and sold into slavery, and the prospects for a life of free and equal dignity in the United States looked slim. So they decided to return to their ancestral homeland and found a new nation.\n\nUnfortunately, there were already people living in Liberia when the Americo-Liberians built their colony there. The Americo-Liberians had been changed by their time in the United States - they spoke English, wore Western clothes, and brought Mainline Protestant religions with them. In many ways, they had become foreigners in Africa. And they looked down on the \"indigenous\" inhabitants of Liberia, denying members of the indigenous ethnicities living in the area birthright citizenship until 1904.\n\n[This page](https://jewishstudies.washington.edu/israel-hebrew/why-israel-isnt-a-settler-colonial-state/) tries to argue that Israel isn't a settler colonial state, and its first argument is that settler colonialism requires a metropole, a mother country, which supports the colony. But Liberia provides the counter example. Americo-Liberians had no metropole - they hailed from the United States, sure, but the United States didn't recognize Liberia until 1862, and it was private organizations like the American Colonization Society that supported the formation of Liberia very early on.\n\nNow, much like the Americo-Liberians, I believe that the Jewish people had a sympathetic reason for wanting a Jewish nation state. After the Holocaust, it wasn't unreasonable to believe that the Jewish disapora would remain forever vulnerable inside of hostile gentile nations.\n\nHowever, much like the Americo-Liberians, the Jewish settlers displaced the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine. The [Nakba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba) occurred in 1948, and saw the flight of 700,000 indigenous Palestinians. Sure, you could say that both the Americo-Liberians and the Jewish settlers had some claim to the territories they settled - Americo-Liberians, as African Americans, hailed from Africa in the past, and Israel is the ancient homeland of the Jewish people.\n\nBut just as the Americo-Liberians had been made foreign by their time as African Americans, the Jewish people coming back to Palestine were not the same as the Jewish diaspora of yore.",

Citizens need an easy method to change their option. USPS or private company could have 3 field website for consumers that notifies businesses for you as a legal notice. Businesses cannot be trusted to make an easy opt-out process, eg see canceling gym memberships. \n\nThe fundamental laws that founded USPS and unregulated business communication 200+ years ago didn't expect billions of advertising letters sent far and wide for pennies, robots printing truckloads of mail at a time, nor digital communications. Modern problems require modern solutions. \n\n**FAQ**\n\n**Opt-out instead**\n\nFundamentally nobody should have to opt-out of receiving trash. Lawmakers agreed by creating anti-trash-dumping laws. Distributing trash in city mailboxes should not be exempt.\n\nIndustry site https://www.dmachoice.org are pay to opt out and themselves estimate 80% effective. Serial renters must re-opt-out every move + deal with the previous tenant's opt-in trash. \n\nChanging businesses, or \"voting with your wallet\", just because of trash mail is inconvenient to unreasonable like your electric company, closest hospital, bank, or other important services. \n\n**First amendment concerns**\n\nThe first amendment provides a right to speak but not to be heard. \nHere the citizen is controlling communication. The government is merely enforcing the citizen's decisions, not making decisions themselves.\n\n**Advertising and Coupons benefits businesses** \n\nGreat! Advertise the benefits inside participating businesses. Such a valuable service will sell itself with stacks of opt-in forms. Just like every other industry. \n\n**USPS survives off of trash mail**\n\nConsider the environment's resources consumed every year to manufacture the letter, transport between manufacturers then to USPS, delivery to your mailbox, consumer evaluates for 0.2 seconds, then transport to recycle center or likely city dump. Doing this as effectively a make-work jobs program is a poor excuse.\n\nOther countries may have solved this problem. Other revenue sources exist. \"Last mile\" delivery is becoming competitive.

By continuing to buy and use these devices without pushing for change, are we not morally complicit?\n\n**Anticipated Counterarguments:**\n\n1. **Complex Supply Chain:** I anticipate others will claim that the supply chain's intricate nature means many consumers might be unaware of the origin of the materials in their devices. Does ignorance absolve one of responsibility?\n\n2. **Responsibility of Companies:** Some might argue that the primary responsibility lies with the companies, not the end-users. If companies are transparent and take measures to address these issues, does it alleviate the consumer's guilt?\n\n3. **Advocacy as a Solution:** Another perspective could be that by acknowledging these issues and advocating for change, consumers can reconcile with the moral implications. Does active advocacy absolve one's conscience?\n\nI sincerely wish to understand varying views on this matter.

How can you agree that all consent MUST be enthusiastic, but be ok with prostitution?

Any argument for what a landlord \"does\" for a tenant ignores that the need for that service is artificially created by the landlord/tenant arrangement.\n\nThe future I imagine, generally speaking, is one in which it is illegal to own a residential property that one does not reside in for a minimum of 3 consecutive months out of the tax year. Apartments should be governed by boards made up of resident-owners. Property owners that violate these laws are given, among whatever other penalties, a window during which they must sell their property. Failure to do so results in seizure and the property being sold at auction, with earnings going to the now former owner. Any new property purchased must be resided in, for a minimum of 3 consecutive months, within a year of the purchase.\n\nI'm certainly open to broad challenges to my uneducated legal prescription above. There could be gaps in my reasoning or obvious unintended consequences I've missed. I'm much less interested in nitpicky arguments about how we could possibly move from our current state to that one, or over whether it should be 3 months or 6, or how these laws would be enforced.

I'm inclined to agree that taxing land in the way they suggest would force landlords into a position where they can only earn money on actual services rendered. This approach is elegant, far less clumsy than mine, and isn't soaked in normative propaganda. Thanks for making such compelling and researched arguments in response to me and others here.\n\nTo the mods crawling around in this post - I \\*\\*understand\\*\\* just fine why most who replied to me think the way they do. Do something about the people calling me a \"socialist\" as if it were an insult, or implying that I have this view because I'm too poor or lazy to own anything. I have no trouble understanding that most are too far gone down the rabbit hole of how society is currently ordered to conceive of a way to order it differently. I came here looking for perspectives like /u/Amablue's - that understand my goals as a basis for explaining why my approach is wrong - and that I received only one is no fault of mine.",

The requirement of lifetime alimony payments, splitting of retirement accounts don’t make it a good deal overall. The chance of financial ruin for both parties is high the longer the marriage is.\n\nI don’t see the reason for involving the state to such a high degree, division of assets and spousal support payment can be astronomically high and payments cannot be deducted from taxes making it even worse.\nI don’t believe marriage is bad, I believe the laws surrounding it are and the overall risks of marriage making it a bad decision to make for most people in todays day and age.\n\nIt’s very easy to get married but extremely hard to get out of it.\n\nLegally I think a marriage contract is a risky and terrible decision that has a high chance of ruin and is a disadvantage to men.

  "title": "CMV: Soccer Will Become the #1 Sport in America by 2050",
  "selftext": "I've been thinking a lot about the future of sports in America, and I'm convinced that soccer will eventually rise to the top spot by 2050. Here's my perspective on why this shift is inevitable:\n\n**Cultural Ties and Demographics**: In most countries, soccer isn't just a sport; it's deeply ingrained in their culture. Unlike the US, where football, basketball, and baseball take precedence, other nations have generations growing up with soccer as a cultural staple. But times are changing, and the influx of immigrants, particularly from Latin American countries, is bringing their soccer passion to the US. Census data predicts that White Americans will no longer be the majority by 2045, with Hispanics being the largest black of the minority majority in America.  As these communities grow and their influence spreads, soccer's popularity will undoubtedly rise. The young Hispanic boys and girls entering the country, and being born in the country today will be major contributors to the nations move toward soccer fandom in the future. \n\n**Safety Concerns and Youth Participation**: The rising concerns about brain injuries in American football are making parents and young athletes reconsider their sport choices. This is where soccer comes in. With its lower risk of severe injuries, soccer becomes an attractive alternative. We're already seeing a shift in participation among high school-aged athletes away from American football https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2023-01-24/youth-football-participation-declining-amid-safety-concerns. As the awareness about safety grows, more and more youngsters and most importantly their parents will opt for other sports that have a lower risk of longe term injury. In the short term I believe that basketball will get a big influx of players because it’s easily accessible and it’s a sport that popular across the globe. But eventually soccer will be the number 1 sport.\n\n**Changing Demographics**: As immigration continues, the demographics of the US are changing. With the Hispanic population becoming a larger part of our society, their love for soccer will have a significant impact. This cultural influence will extend beyond just the Latino community. Soccer's popularity will trickle into other groups, like African Americans, and those from the African diaspora, and those from the Caribbean. This diversity in soccer's fan base will accelerate its growth.\n\n**National Team Success**: America likes nothing more than winning. The performance of the US Men's National Soccer Team will play a crucial role in cementing soccer's place as the top sport. Imagine if the team makes substantial progress in major international tournaments, maybe even clinching a World Cup victory. This achievement would not only captivate the nation but also establish soccer as a source of national pride and excitement. As the pool of top tier athletes widens to include those who are interested in making soccer a career, the talent level of the USMNT will grow. \n\n**Changing Times**: The younger generation is growing up in a different era. With the increasing availability of global media and the internet, exposure to international soccer leagues and stars is greater than ever. This exposure will naturally translate into a growing interest in playing and following soccer. A prime example of this is the buzz and excitement being generated by Lionel Messi joining the MLS after arguably one of the best World Cup Tournaments in modern history.\n\nIn conclusion, the blend of cultural shifts, safety concerns, changing demographics, and potential national team success makes soccer's rise to the #1 sport in America by 2050 highly likely. I'm open to hearing different perspectives, but this is where I stand. Change my view!\n\n**TLDR**: Soccer's rise in the US is driven by shifting demographics, safety concerns, potential national team success, and changing cultural influences. It's likely to become the #1 sport by 2050. Change my view!",

  "title": "CMV: Capitalism, though flawed, is practically the best method of resource allocation.",
  "selftext": "Though capitalism is imperfect, I'm hard pressed to understand a workable system that is better. The only practical alternatives of which I'm aware are controlled economies (government price setting) or communal ones (prohibition on private property). I suppose the abolition/destruction of resources is theoretically perfect, as there would be nothing to allocate, though obviously impractical. \n\nPrice setting is complex. In order to set an accurate price, both supply and demand must be known. This means understanding both the means of production (and input materials, labor, etc.) as well as the needs and available resources of each potential buyer. A theoritally correct price would take all of these factors into consideration and the historical track record for governments setting prices is poor, leading me to conclude that it's an unworkable solution.\n\nProhibiting private property and forcing property into public ownership (communal) is problematic because it only works if everybody agrees to it. This is a better alternative to capitalism which doesn't work at scale, making it impractical. A small commune where everyone is on the same page may find value in this method, but a large nation will inevitably have dissenters, rendering the system oppressive through its lack of individualism. Even communes have individual boundaries, such as my nieghbor is not free to burn down my residence while I'm living in it. (Though I suppose I could just as easily move into the arsonist's residence at no cost.)\n\nCapitalism's flaws include the anti-trust paradox, the subjectivity of certain resources, the inheritance problem, scamming, and greed cycles.\n\nAnti-trust: As popularized by Robert Bork, the more regulated a monopolized industry is, the more paradoxically monopolistic it becomes. He argues that this is because regulation presents an increased barrier to entry, thus reducing competition by filtering out potential competitors who do not have the resources to clear the barrier to entry and enter the industry, making it even less competitive.\n\nSubjective Resources: Some resources cannot be quantified, and therefore price setting is not an applicable method of allocating the resource. Human life, for example, is quantified by the life insurance industry by projecting a person's future income. Reducing a person's value to a dollar figure provides an incomplete picture of their worth because they have many sourcecs of intangible value, such as their relationships, their ideas, their experiences, etc. Governments may combat this issue with welfare programs, but those programs generally also assign dollar values based on an individual's situation, such as people with disabilities receiving a certain amount of money, families with lots of children receiving a certain amount in tax breaks, etc.\n\nInheritance: Capitalism provides the wealthy with greater influence over resource allocation. Wealth is indirectly correlated to price sensitivity; i.e. the more money you have, the more you're willing to spend it without feeling the pain. This still works theoretically because the people who earn the most money have provided a valuable resource to society in order to obtain it and therefore should be able to effectively decide how future resources are to be allocated. However, in reality, large sums of wealth often get passed down upon death and inherited by a person who did not provide value to society, and therefore does not understand how to allocate resources effectively. For example, kids who inherit large sums of money tend to blow it quickly, just like lottery winners, who have demonstrably worse lives after winning the lottery and are ineffective in the allocation of their lottery winnings. Note: Some may also argue that the government has no moral right to tell individuals how their private recources ought to be allocated.\n\nScamming: Capitalism provides an incentive for dishonesty, namely obtaining money without providing value in return. If the government is unable to crack down an scammers, then the only recourse is for consumers to band together to combat scammers (which may be impossible or difficult depending on the situation).\n\nCycles of Greed: Capitalist markets have gone through historical cycles of prosperity (euphoria/greed) and austerity (fear). Instead of markets remaining at a steady equilibrium with gradual changes, they tend to overshoot in both directions, exacerbating both the positive and negative effects on either end of the spectrum. In the case of euphoria, people live high on the hog, giving in to greed and excess, thus acting wastefully. In the case of austerity, people in fear go without, causing unnecessary harm and devaluing consumers who ought to have been able to access certain resources, yet are no longer able to. In both cases, the allocation of resources is inefficient.\n\nUltimately, prices are prohibitive; they require a cost to be paid in order to obtain a resource, ensuring that resources are allocated to the people who need them the most, i.e. are willing and able to pay for them (in the capitalist context). If prices are not prohibitive, then resources will be misallocated because waste will no longer be seen as painful, there is no cost to be paid. Capitalism harnesses individual selfishness (getting the best deal for one's self and avoiding steep costs) in order to promote the greater good (allocating resources across a society in the least wasteful way possible via pricing).\n\nThe invisible hand is our best option. There is no practical economic system which is better at allocating resources than capitalism because no system fixes the flaws of capitalism without introducing more egregious flaws of its own.\n\nEdit: I'm specifically talking about free market capitalism.

The defense of \"Hamas dress up as civilians so killings of some civilians are justified\" has broken down because it's clear that IDF cannot distinguish between \"Hamas fighters dress up as civilians\" and \"regular civilians\". If that distinction cannot be made, then it's no different from indiscriminate killings of military-age men in Gaza. This will result in a significant change in global and domestic support for the IDF, demanding them to pursue Hamas a lot more cautiously, to the point where the IDF will say they can no longer do that effectively, thus ending the conflict without achieving their military goals.",

  "selftext": "Hello all, let me preface this by saying I know I am going to get ripped apart for this post, but I am genuinely open to having my mind changed. I come from the south and didn't meet my first openly LGBT person until I moved out of my tiny hick town at 19. I used to have weird prejudices and repulsions until I opened up to the world a bit more.\n\nAnyhow, to get to my reasoning. A few years ago, while working at a warehouse, I met my first trans individual. We were the only two people within 20+ feet of anyone else, constantly working together 5 days a week/8 hrs a day. Due to this, we developed a good friendship, added him on social media, and it was kinda my 'woah-this-is-just-another-person' moment, due to the fact we shared a lot of the same interests. The thing is, they never told me, or as far as I know, anyone else they were trans. They were just a man. And that is what everyone considered him to be, even if some small features still retained from their previous gender. They don't have it on social media, either.\n\nFast forward a few years later, I have a very open-minded (and patient lol) girlfriend and she happens to be best friends with a person who is trans. They're a good person to be around, very funny and laid back. However, they are very loud about the fact that they are trans. she has it on their social media, she brings it up in casual conversation.\n\nNow, of course it shouldn't matter how anyone label themselves. However, what has been explained to me through my own research, accounts of trans individuals on socials like Reddit, and my girlfriend is that (correct me if I'm wrong): They felt out of their body as their assigned gender, and having to act in accordance with the gender roles they were assigned to was torturous. So it is either transitioning, or living life like they are lying to themselves. Which I 100% get and empathize with.\n\nWhat I don't get is, if it was so torturous to live life as that gender why would you advertise you used to be it and now aren't? Why not just be firm in your stance \"I am a man.\" \"I am a woman.\"? It feels like attention-seeking behavior to me, and somewhat akin to me saying \"Hi yes, my name is X and I have a penis. What's up?\". Whenever I hear the words or see someone label someone themselves as transgender, I can't help to feel weirded out by the fact they are even saying it.  So, I am hoping maybe if I understand it more, I can get rid of that feeling. There must be something I am missing for something so glaringly obvious.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses, I won't be answering to anymore though. My view has been changed.",

Following that line of thinking, “Islamophobia” would be the irrational fear of Islamic people, which makes sense given that many of the countries affected by Islamophobia are countries that have been targeted by radical Islamic extremists. Therefore I don’t believe it to be a stretch that people would be afraid of Islamic people. I personally don’t care about anyone’s personal characteristics, but I understand why people would be cautious following 9/11 and Manchester Arena and such.\n\nIf we go a little further, “homophobia” should be considered to be an irrational fear of homosexual people, right? Apparently not. I assume there’s some level of nuance when the logic is applied to actual people. It could be something to do with older generations and Islamophobia that has caused the standard to shift away from “-ist” given that “racist” has been around for hundreds of years, as has “sexist”, but I’m sure the correct term for somebody who doesn’t like people who are LGBTQ+ should be a “homosexist”. However after having looked the word up I was shocked to find it wasn’t in the dictionary. I don’t believe anyone besides traditional religious people are actively afraid of gay people, and I believe that religious people are only afraid of the disrespect to their belief system.\n\nAnyway, provided the context, I think that words like “homophobia” and “transphobia” should be turned into “homosexist” and “transsexist”, as that lies more in line with the root words that make up the whole phrase.",

Normal everyday restaurant owners, landlords, homeowners, pedestrians, transit employees, etc very often treat  homeless people as if they were pests rather than human beings.\n\nLike, when restaurants throw out food it is common to lock the food trash containers just to keep homeless people from eating *the perfectly good food within*.

No if, ands or bits - if you bought the game, you hate all members of the trans community. \n\nWorse if you just reviewed/streamed it, you're anti-trans - the controversy with Girlfriend reviews and the current state of the sub shows that they are not above using bullying tactics to make their point. To me, and their completely unapologetic nature about it, demonstrates this sub is a hate sub.\n\nMy second point is that the sub is actually just moral grandstanding, meaning they are making their argument as a way to as easily as possible state their philosophical beliefs without having to do the work or actually supporting them.\n\nYou know what I haven't seen at this sub, like at all, during this time of controversy? Links to LGBTQ or pro-trans issue charities or NPOs. Or links to how to volunteer and help the LGBTQ, or even just the trans, communities. Really, to my knowledge the sub has not supported or discussed any ways to actually benefit any members of the LGBTQ community other than \"post mean -spirited memes and yell at ppl who disagree with you online\". Plus, the sub is collectively incredibly morally absolute - who either hate everyone who buys, plays, or discusses the game in any even remotely positive light, or you're transphobic.\n\nFor these reasons, I genuinely don't mind labels this sub as a hate group and that I should be banned.",

This will only spread more hate between both communities of opposing sides.\n  \n\n  \nIt has reached a point where \"losing\" one of this debates is considered a public humiliation, this i feel could create a situation when the person in the wrong could hesitate and refuse to admit their mistakes even if they themselves have become aware of them just so to avoid social scrutiny not only coming from the debate itself but also being the target of online mockery in the form of youtube videos titled in the nature of \"This personed owned this person\", \"This persons destroys this person\", a situation more easily avoided if being in the wrong stopped being so prone to social humiliation, once again creating even more resentment between people.\n  \n\n  \nI do understand that not everyone is easy to talk to nor to reason with, some people could indeed lose their cool in a debate and sometimes you have to fight fire with fire to defend yourself., but it still feels like too much and unnecessary.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, i am not against debating in general, exchanging ideas and opinions with others is perfectly natural and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it, you can even argue that i posted here to have one, which i did.\nMy issues arrive when the \"debates\" proceed to unnecesarly lack civilty and turn into childish arguments where the pursuit of truth and reaching a mutual understanding stops being the focus, and it becomes about who can humiliate the opposite side the most.\n\nConclusions i came to after reading your coments:\n\n1. How people see themselves as human beings comes in large part from their opinions and beliefs and people associate these to their persona, so when someone challanges one's world views they feel as if they themselves as a human beings are under attack leading people to hold on to their egos, causing a situation where peoples emotions get the best of them causing them to get angry as they refuse to admit that they might be at fault as that for them would feel like they would be admitting that they are indecent or lesser has a human beings.\n\n2. Discussions taking place in front of a large audience could take an effect on the people partaking in it, compelling them to simply seek social gratification out fear of public humiliation, people will make it their focus not to necessarly change to opposing side's mind but to humiliate them in front everyone to make them look weak and dumb, that way they get to look strong and intelligent in comparision, hence avoiding socila scrutiny.\n\n3. Certain people defend and take positions considered by many to be outrageous and objectively wrong such as things of the nature of marginalizing and dehumanization of vulnerable groups, making these people with who will be very difficult to have a civil discussion for very long.",

  "selftext": "So I will upfront admit I don’t know much about military training outside of movies and stuff that I read online and from military subreddits. So forgive me if this sounds absurd and I’m very much open to having my mind changed.\n\nSo I hope we can agree that psychological/emotional abuse is a very bad thing. However it seems such abuse is glorified and claimed to be necessary in military training and not being able to handle being abused makes one weak. That the purpose of military training is to mentally break you down and brainwash you into what the military wants you to be. \n\nHow does this sound any different from similar types of abuse? Like abusive employers using similar tactics against their employees. Or abusive husbands/wives doing the same thing to break their spouse. Or even parents using such tactics to make their children “stronger” or “ it builds character?” What if schools were to be run like military camps?\n\nI maybe biased, because I was bullied throughout my entire school life and had a dad who could be easily enraged by the smallest mistakes and, even though he never laid a hand on me, took put all his anger and rage on me almost weekly like a drill sergeant almost. None of this has made me stronger, it’s only left me with severe depression, social anxiety, and occasionally suicidal ideation. Science agrees that even non physical abuse can still greatly harm someone. So I’m not sure how it’s good for soldiers to go through that abuse In training and is glorified when everywhere else it is not acceptable.",

Even Tom Clancy, the famous military-thriller author, complained that the Iraq war lacked a good *casus belli* \\- it had no good justification for it.\n\nFast-forward nineteen years, and Russia invades Ukraine on a similarly flimsy pretense - that Ukraine has \"fascists\" and that \"NATO is expanding aggressively near Russia with hostile intent.\" Both of these pretenses were just as laughable and empty as the Bush administration's WMD justification for the invasion of Iraq - but what did the United States do?

  "selftext": "# Please read the first two edits that are bolded. My core view has been altered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**edit: People keep pointing out the same argument about Black Panther being a bad example. I already changed my mind about that. I just don't know who to use as an example instead. You can give me some.**\n\n**edit: Hello, I got my view changed again. Now the basis of my argument- Snow White being white, is kind of broken. Here's my delta message:**\n\n**\"Hm. I guess you are right. I was silly to call her brown. She is a bit more tanned than anything and yeah, she is essentially white.**\n\n**But I do think that my argument extends to more than just Snow White. It extends to other instances of black washing. If Snow White were to be black, that would be silly, yes? I think that it extends to the Little Mermaid a little bit, but perhaps not as much. I still think that the original's depiction of the Little Mermaid as white serves as a basic descriptor of her. So I think it's silly to change the basic description of a character.\"**\n\nA new remake of Snow White is currently being made and they've, controversially, changed Snow White’s race. I disagree with this; it comes off as virtue signalling. The character's race was changed to be more diverse, presumably.\n\nNow, I don't see what makes the change in Snow White's ethnicity any different to changing Black Panther to a different ethnicity or race. Snow White’s ethnicity and complexion are integral to her character, hence her name. One relatively 'big' part of the story is her complexion and how she is the ‘fairest of them all,’ and unique because of it. ~~Similarly, Black Panther’s name originates from the Black Panther party~~  (crossed out because that's factually incorrect) and his race is relatively important compared to most characters. \\`\n\nEven as a person who leans left (essentially centrist), there is the double standard that much of the left holds. The double standard is the opinion or view that changing a white person’s race is okay, or perhaps even great, but changing a black person’s race is racist and deemed whitewashing. I understand there is some nuance here but I still believe the two things are on a similar level. Whitewashing is bad because it pushes forward the message that being black is ‘bad’ or not desirable. Blackwashing should be seen as bad as it pushes forward the message that whiteness is not desirable. Perhaps the intention of blackwashing in media is to be diverse, but again, I find this to be virtue signalling and there are better ways to go about this… just make new characters or new movies.\n\nIn my opinion, race should not be changed if it’s an original and old character, particularly if it’s relatively integral to the character’s identity. Just make new characters.\n\nI assume that I will get replies that point out that Snow White is not Disney’s story and there are many different versions, thus, it’s not necessarily race-swapping characters. But that’s wrong:\n\n>*Snow White is a live-action remake of the Disney animation classic \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\" which debuted in 1937. However, it appears that Disney is approaching the seven dwarf characters in a new way in order to avoid reiterating prejudices from the first animated feature. The lead actress Zegler also hinted at the story's contemporary revisions meant to appeal to the progressive audience during the D23 event.*[*\\[1\\]*](https://collider.com/snow-white-disney-live-action-remake-release-date-cast-plot/)\n\nThe issue is that Disney and other massive corporations are making *\\[x\\]* and then advertising it as *\\[y\\]*. The only reason for this is because these corporations want a bigger audience so they grab nostalgic stories such as Snow White and other classics and then reboot them to get a guaranteed audience. For example, Velma, a TV series where they race-swapped Velma, is hardly the original character- neither are the rest of the characters, really. They marketed the series as Scooby-Doo characters to gain instant and free traction despite the fact they are hardly even the same characters.\n\nSo yeah, that’s basically my view. I just don’t agree with the race-swapping of random characters and I think that race-swapping Black Panther is of the same nature as race-swapping Snow White.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: My view was partially changed. Black Panther was not a good example because he lives in Africa and rules over it thus it's pretty different to just being a black person. I should have used a different character.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit. Here's a reply I made that has points I didn't put in the post. It's kind of a counter-argument against some reappearing points in the replies:\n\nIt's not really white supremacy for white people to make white characters. I am sure that other countries would make characters of their own, dominant race within their country or continent. It can be a problem but to call it 'white supremacy' is such a big stretch.\n\nFurthermore, making random characters black is not actually doing anything for black (or any other race) people other than the actor. But even then, it can be damaging for the actor too. They'll get a lot of hate- it's inevitable. Changing old characters who had a basic description of them- such as being white or simply being white, then it will obviously get backlash for it.Why can't we just not race-wash and instead make new characters with good representation of their culture instead? They won't nearly as much hate and it'll be a much better character. We don't need to race-wash characters to achieve diversity.\n\nI would hate it if they changed an old character who was established to be another race- and that race doesn't need to be white- to an Asian character in order to achieve diversity. I am Asian. I do not care. That's just silly. Make new Asian characters.\n\nParticularly when you're race-washing a white character who primarily lives in a Western country and has no connection to the race that the character has been swapped to... then it's more silly. You're literally just making white people look black, look Asian, look Latino.\n\nWhile yes, there are people, myself included, who live in Western countries while being POC and acting like a Western person... you're still making pre-existing white characters POC without changing anything about their character which is a bit silly because clearly, even if a POC acts Western, they don't live the exact same as Western people. This only really goes for movies that have people living in the real world though, not like, the Little Mermaid, for example.\n\n&#x200B;",

It can reach a point where you feel bad about yourself but I think that depends mostly on your overall experience doing it. I got past that point and having sex for money really just feels like giving someone a massage nowadays.\n\nMost of the dangers come from people who like I said, are preying on those who they know are vulnerable, and have little protection from the law because they themselves are involved in what is labeled as crime. There’s clients who can become possessive and try to hold a sw against their will, clients who coerce sw’s into drug use, guys who harass, manipulate, threaten, and overall abuse sw’s to pimp them out and take a chunk of their earnings.\n\nI believe it stems from the fact that sw’s are labeled as criminals and can be punished for their acts, as well as the entitlement these men feel to be disrespectful and inconsiderate. Sw being illegal is enabling them to feel like they can just abuse and take advantage of people because in a way they are “punishing a criminal” , as well as taking away the fear of any consequences because the law does not protect the sw’s.\n\nIf sw was legalized, and maybe regulated, it would repel these abusers because the law would be protecting the sw’s as they are doing a perfectly legal job. Also there could be room for more resources for people who have gone into sw and find it difficult to get out. It could become an official industry that benefits a chunk of the population, and allows the workers to go in and out of it safely.\n\nEdit: I’m in the U.S where it is completely illegal (minus one state), although obviously rampant.\n\n\nEdit Edit: There’s a few comments that wouldn’t let me reply for some reason and then disappeared.

I'm using the word \"protest\" very lightly here, as a true protest would mean a boycott by millions.\n\nEdit2: [This comment changed my view in regards to the possible future of the protest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/162msnr/comment/jxyc8a7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\nEdit: Still waiting for someone to attempt to refute my points and not personally attack me.

Most didn't even achieve socialism (which we can generally define as the workers controlling the means of production).\n\nI acknowledge that the meaning of words change over time, but I don't see how this applies here, as communism was defined by theory, not observance, so it doesn't follow that observance would change theory. \n\nIt's as if I said: Here is the blueprint for my ultimate dreamhouse, and then I tried to build my dreamhouse with my bare hands and a singular hammer which resulted in an outcome that was not my ultimate dreamhouse. \n\nYou wouldn't look at my blueprint and critique it based on my poor attempt, you would simply criticize my poor attempt.\n\nI think this distinction is very important, because people stand to gain from having a well-rounded understanding of history, human behavior, and politics.

  "selftext": "I'm Malaysian Chinese and I am recently reminded of the occupation of the Japanese during WW2 in Malaysia. They were absolutely brutal against the Chinese community, massacring tens of thousands of us, torturing more, and forcing women and girls into sex labour. I recall talking to my grandaunts and granduncles about the 3 years and 8 months the Japanese were here and they still hold a significant disdain towards Japan and Japanese even today. They would sometimes refuse to buy a product just because it's Japanese, or not welcome Japanese guests to their house. I think that this sentiment is fairly common amongst many East Asians and South East Asians elders, especially Chinese and Koreans. I found myself empathizing with her position, even though I firmly believe that bigotry is morally wrong.\n\nI also recently came across Mia Schem's interview, a hostage captured by Hamas and now freed. She said, \"There are no innocent civilians in Gaza\". My first response was disgust at another attempt at dehumanisation, but I realised that she was sexually assaulted while in captivity, and that traumatic experience is what shaped her comments. It will, of course, be different if an Israeli politician says the same thing, because that rhetoric will likely be used to inflict further violence on Palestinians.\n\nI came to realise that when someone has gone through something traumatic, it's unreasonable to expect them to assess a situation rationally. A Titanic survivor may think that ships are never safe to board again. We know it's untrue but we can't blame them for thinking that way. Similarly, we can hold the position that bigotry is immoral in a vacuum and not blame those who have undergone extreme trauma for being bigoted.\n\nThere are, of course, boundaries. While bigotry can be justified, violence in the name of bigotry is not. If Mia Schem stabs an Israeli Arab, that's just as wrong as a racist stabbing someone else. My grandaunts can't just punch every Japanese she sees just because of what their country did to her 80 years ago.",

  "selftext": "Often people on Reddit criticize capitalism and the corporations that practice it. The latest criticism argued that low wage workers, especially in developing countries, are paid below slave wages by ***greedy*** corporations trying to increase their profits. The reddit post argued that it would be more expensive to purchase, house, feed, etc., slaves than the wages the corporations pay workers. This argument is deeply flawed!\n\nCorporations pay you based on the value you create. Corporations would love to pay you more! High-wage workers become customers for more expensive products produced by other corporations. Capitalism is not to blame when workers have too few skills to earn a decent living. Also, highly productive workers will make more for the capitalist corporation. To be sure, there is a tension between workers pay and corporate profits. Other things being equal, higher wages for the same level of worker productivity mean lower corporate profits. However, as workers gain skills and otherwise  become more productive, they increase both their income and the corporate profits. It is not a zero sum game!\n\nI often read critiques of Apple and Amazon for paying low wages. Is it truly a corporation's fault if workers have such low-value skills? Should these companies simply pay more to workers regardless of their skills? What would these workers who some argue are receiving below slave wages do if Apple and Amazon did not exist?\n\n\"Live free and starve\" is a great essay by a person who had lived in a country where child labor was prevalent. While the writer acknowledged that the children had miserable lives, she pointed out that they would otherwise starve without such jobs. Viewed from that vantage point, the corporations that employ this child labor offer opportunities that literally mean the difference in a child working 12 hours a day in sometimes dangerous conditions, or being reduced to crime, prostitution, or starvation.\n\nBecause so many people on reddit have a  view different than mine, I feel like I'm missing something. Am I wrong?\n\nCMV\n\nEdit: The federal government collected $5 trillion in taxes during 2022, and they spent $1.2 trillion on social programs. The GDP produced over $25 trillion in goods and services. My point is that without the wealth generation of capitalism, the US would have produced a lot less, lowering the amount we could afford to spend on social programs. In my view, capitalism makes social welfare spending possible.\n\nHowever, I do admit that many of your arguments, which centered on the way wealth is distributed, did give me pause.

  "selftext": "I've posted on other subreddits about this exact topic before. I still hold this same view, but more and more things are making me think that I may be wrong.\n\n**Disclaimer: I am not talking about, or trying to defend, US gun law, as that is a steaming pile of dogshit inside of a garbage fire inside of a trainwreck that I don't want to get into, simply because that topic is much more complicated than the view that I hold and want to challenge.**\n\nFor context: I am from the Czech Republic, a country where you can get a firearms license and buy almost any non-fully automatic firearm, but am not yet old enough to legally own firearms.\n\nI personally believe that guns are very much like cars. Incredibly dangerous and capable of killing people, many people at once if used by someone especially violent, however, their ownership is important in the world that we live in.\n\nCars are obviously much more important, however, image someone walking home later in the evening at night. Maybe a bartender coming home from work, or someone that goes to the gym late in the evening going home, or a jogger that jogs in the evening and comes back home after dusk. \n\nThere is a not insignificant (especially if the first case, due to the people that sometimes frequent bars) chance that you may be attacked/mugged. Maybe at knife point, maybe at gunpoint, or (as is most common in the Czech Republic), by several people that appear to be unarmed (and either are or just haven't drawn their weapons yet).\n\nObviously, any person with half a brain will realize that handing over their wallet or whatever the aggressor wants is the correct approach. Your wallet is not worth your life.\n\nHowever, there is a miniscule chance that the aggressor still wants to attack you, even after you co-operate, or maybe, the attacker *just* wanted to attack you. This happens: The bartender pisses off someone because they stopped pouring them beer, the gym-goer gets into an argument with someone at the gym, or any other number of possibilities.\n\nNow, what happens next?\n\nIf you are unarmed, you are basically out of luck. Unless somebody else sees you get attacked, you're either going to the hospital, or into the morgue. In either case, you basically cannot defend yourself. Even if someone calls the police, they aren't going to arrive on time, that just doesn't happen.\n\n**Does a gun guarantee your safety? NO! Absolutely not. Does it give you a fighting chance? Yes. Yes it does.** \n\nAnd this is why I believe that people should have access to firearms. In those small, fringe cases where normal, law-abiding people are assaulted for some reason (hell, people have been shot because of their race, gender identity or sexuality before), they need to defend themselves, because the police won't be there in time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may ask \"What about assault weapons, would a pistol be enough?\".\n\nAn assault weapon, while nice, doesn't really give someone with ill-intent more power. Hear me out: Pistols can be loaded with magazines that have 30-50 or even more rounds. These can be concealed well, are lighter and considerably cheaper. An assault rifle (like an AKM or any AR-15-esque weapon) is, effectively the exact same. \n\nA rifle is made to pierce armor, have more range, and a higher accuracy than a pistol. All 3 of these things don't really matter for someone in a civilian setting, because none of these ever come into play. This means that rifles are basically just fun guns to shoot at a range. They aren't practical, but neither is a massive Ford truck.",

  "selftext": "Today I was once again confronted with someone on Twitter saying that topic x will probably lead to people not voting Democrat in the future and a dozen or so answers from people saying that these people not voting Democrat are the ones to blame is Republicans come to power. (And just for clarity: Any argument who is or isn't the greater evil is irrelevant for the view itself, but I think it is clearly the Republicans, just to play with open cards here)  \n\nThis kind of rhetoric has always existed but I personally became acutely aware of it after the 2016 election. And I don't really think it holds up any water if your goal is actually trying to ensure that the greater evil doesn't come into power.  \nIn my view, you're asking a single person to give up quite literally all the leverage they have in this political system (their vote) and expect them to not want anything in return. As long as you're the lesser of two evils, you are owed their vote and no matter if you yourself become less palatble to them, the onus is on them to still vote for you. In my view that has it exactly backwards, you have millions of decentralized players that are all binary in their leverage (They vote for you or they don't) while the big party is centralized and can make concessions on thousands of points. I believe it to be misguided to seek the blame on the voters, when the party should clearly be the first target. If you don't manage to motivate people to vote for you over the greater evil, that's on you, first and foremost.  \nFor me this doesn't compute, why should those people give up any and all leverage and be the ones responsible to beat back fascism while the party isn't even asked to give up anything, like moving to the left on some issues?\n\nAnd even if that doesn't work for you for any kind of moral or ethical reason, from a purely logistical standpoint, trying to shame millions of voters for voting for you or else you will tell them they enable fascism is not as fruitful as trying to capture people when the other option is outright fascism. From a purely logistical standpoint, the Democratic party has much more concessions to make before it, in my opinion, is more feasible to ask voters to make the one and only concession that they have.  \n\nAnother argument that I read is that those people are just whiny and entitled and are not making the sensible decision over any number of perceived slights (like in 2016 when people accused Bernie fans to be sore losers and not vote for Hillary) when in reality, people are getting motivated for any candidate that is even slightly to the left of the average Democrat. I don't think this binary of \"Either I get EVERYTHING or I ain't gonna vote for you\" exists in any meanigful number of people. And for those that it exists in, they are not the kind you shame into voting for you anyways.",

  "selftext": "EDIT: Thanks for all the perspectives. It's definitely highlighted some of my own internal biases. I've realized that I don't consider the National Anthem as politically neutral. I unintentionally associated with specific political movements. \n\nFurthermore, I've been mentally gatekeeping the Anthem to only government entities. That's wrong. The Anthem belongs to all Americans, and we should be free to use it however we want, and the more people use it, the less it's tied to specific political movements.\n\nIt's still propaganda, but in the big scheme of things, not a huge deal.\n\nGo sports ball!\n\n\\------------------\n\nThe way the US national anthem is used at sporting events is wrong. It's crass advertising at best, or manipulative propaganda at worst.\n\nAt least at the Olympics, or FIFA, I understand it's intended to be a friendly national rivalry.\n\nBut at events like college sports, NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, these are fundamentally entertainment venues. They have absolutely nothing to do with national patriotism. There's no civic duty involved. There's no sacrifice for country involved. This is not the funeral for our servicemen or front line first responders who gave their lives for country. This is not a political rally, or townhall. We are paying money to be entertained.\n\nIf we stood for the national anthem to before watching Captain America punch Thanos in the face we would recognize there's some dystopian shenanigans going on.\n\nI understand WHY these organizations do it. Every advertising agency wants to link their product to national pride. It sells tickets. But for other products we understand it to be crass and not to be overdone. If you slap flags and eagles with striped hats shooting M16's onto breakfast cereal, we recognize it to be naked opportunism, not a genuine love of country.\n\nFurthermore, the WAY it's done is pure propaganda. Everything stops. Everyone stands up. Everyone puts their hand on their heart, and everyone stops to stare at a flag and sing along. If I flipped the flag and song and changed the location to a foreign country, we would recognize this to be cult of personality brain washing.\n\nI understand WHY the government is ok with this. People like their sports ball. Associate the government with love of sports ball means the populus has good brain juices towards Uncle Sam.\n\nI also understand that most people just go along with it without thinking too hard. It's a small gesture and a \"cultural\" thing.\n\nBut that makes it worse for me. This is a systematized ritual where corporate greed and mindless nationalism are used to sell entertainment, while pushing large groups of people for mindless love of country. There is no critical thought to the actual process of government, attempts to improve or country, or truly appreciate both the good and bad of our country.

  "selftext": " From my perspective as a (non-Marxist) social democrat/modern liberal/secular humanist; I don't see many differences between Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan. The policy of being soft on Russia was actually started by George W. Bush, not Obama, when Putin invaded Georgia and George W Bush did literally nothing. Obama merely continued most of Bush's foreign policy idiocy (I don't approve of him being soft on Russia when they invaded Crimea). Likewise, Trump shows overt favoritism to Israel (a bipartisan American policy since the 1970's) and Saudi Arabia (a VERY GOP policy since the end of WW2). Trump's weird isolationism is more akin to standard GOP policy prior to Eisenhower's presidency (remember that tarriffs and protectionism were a Republican policy from the late 19th century until the post-WW2 era; indeed the robber barons of the Gilded Age usually favored protectionist policies in the US; and we all know how the Smoot-Hawley Tarriff made the Great Depression worse)\n\nDomestically, I am not the first to point out that Trump's response to COVID-19 is following Reagan's precedent of AIDS denialism. His major policy achievements are tax cuts on upper class earners (THE animating philosophy of modern conservatism), excessive swelling of the national debt in peacetime (a bipartisan issue that Reagan essentially started when he surpassed Carter and Nixon-Ford's debt spending combined) and relentless focus on unsustainable stock market gains combined with a very irresponsible FED policy (Remember it was Carter who appointed Paul Volcker, and we all know how Alan Greenspan's tenure ended). Trump's relentless antagonism of Latin American migrants is standard GOP ideology (support the War on Drugs and blame Mexico and Central America when American demand for addictive substances creates drug cartels); indeed the perception that the Democrats support illegal immigrants is really idiotic when Barack Obama deported more people than George W Bush and Joe Biden is continuing Trump's policies on the Mexican-American border. Likewise, Trump has basically animated the right-wing people of every religion not just Protestant Christianity, but also right-wing Catholics, Hindutva, actual Islamists, Orthodox Jews, etc. One can even argue that every major religion is being split along left-right divides these days thanks to Globalization, but I digress. Not even getting into the overt racism and general hatred of activist culture whether it be #MeToo or BLM (again, this very much started because of Barry Goldwater opposing the Civil Rights Act and courting formerly Democrat-leaning racists). People who antagonizing countries like Honduras and Nigeria by calling them \"shitholes\" in public don't seem like people who support legal immigration (I'm going through the process myself; it is NOT easy); and indeed Trump has done a lot to cut legal immigration (hatred of nonwhite people because Latin Americans are \"brown\" or Muslims \"hate Western civilization\" or \"The Christian European character of the US should not be changed\" is nothing new and indeed, hatred of immigrants both legal and illegal is as old as the hills - the GOP of the 19th century certainly hated non-Anglo Saxon people to an astounding degree)\n\nReally, the major thing that I see Trump being different from other Republicans is his hatred of democracy; but honestly I think the Libertarian movement has been inculcating this ideology for a while. \"We're a Republic, not a Democracy\" is also a sentiment that the Founding Fathers (the famous ones anyway - people like Thomas Paine were a minority) approved of.\n\n\\*No personal attacks please; I just want to know for you \"Never Trump\" people, what makes you guys different from MAGA?

  "selftext": "Gun control is constitutional. Justice Antonin Scalia stated so in his majority opinion for District of Columbia v Heller (2008). Here’s just a portion of what he said:\r  \n\n\n>Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any whatsoever and for whatever purpose: For example, concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues.\n\n\r  \nHe goes on to mention the “historical tradition” in the U.S. of restricting dangerous weapons. That is a very broad statement. Would that also cover travel restrictions, sales restrictions, large magazines (over 10+), trigger locks, or stabilizing braces? How about licensing and training requirements?  \n\n\rSCOTUS appears to have given Americans an unlimited right to buy every type of weapon imaginable except a howitzer. Precedent seems forgotten. In a country full of people with simmering emotions, that could be dangerous. However, on Friday, Justice Alito temporarily froze a lower court order that bars the government from regulating so-called ghost guns – untraceable homemade weapons – as firearms under federal law.  It's a start.  \n\nIt would not take sweeping reform.   Adjustments to existing regulation and enforcement of the present laws can have a major impact in keeping weapons out of the hands of those with criminal intent and the severely mentally ill.  \n\nHere are three excellent articles that sum up the issues:\n\n* Gun control is constitutional — just ask the Supreme Court | The Hill\r\n* Gun Control Is Constitutional.

  "title": "CMV: Forcing borrowers to pay back student loans is literally worse than theft.",
  "selftext": "Like many people, I am upset by the recent SCOTUS decision on loans. I believe that not forgiving student loans is wrong. Not only that, I believe it is so wrong, it is theft, and a particularly perverse type of theft. Since this belief causes me a lot of distress, I'd like to take a shot at changing it.\n\nA common sentiment is \"You agreed to pay the loan, so you should\". I think that, in general, people should pay loans they agree to take out, and that in general, they should honor contracts they enter. However, if one party commits fraud to get a contract signed, that invalidates it. If I buy a car and the dealership tells me the car has undergone a 100-point inspection and is in excellent condition, but it's then revealed that Danny Devito rolled back the mileage with a drill, put sawdust in the engine, and superglued the muffler on, I am a victim of fraud, and should get my money back.\n\nThe government forced me and other borrowers to go to school from the time we were small children. At the school, for 13 years, we were trained to believe that teachers and school staff were trustworthy, and were the people we should look to for knowledge. For this time, most staff members (in my case it was literally every single one) told us time and time again that going to college was the absolute best possible decision we could make in our lives, and that any degree would more than pay for itself over time. Even as a child, I remember asking a counselor giving a presentation about the difference between liberal arts and STEM degrees, and was told that while some degrees earned more than others, any degree was still a great investment and that a typical degree would net us a million dollars over our lifetimes. She even had a fancy government-issued fact sheet that talked about that.\n\nThe thing is, that number is a lie. Every study I have seen that calculates the value of college is designed in a ridiculous way that is designed to inflate the value as much as possible. For example, they never include salaries of students who are unemployed, or who are underemployed and working part-time jobs, or who are in school for another degree because they couldn't get a job with the first one. If you have a group of 1 lawyer making 100k, and 9 others working at Starbucks, they calculate the average at 100k. They also estimate future earnings based on earnings growth of past generations - never considering the possibility that more than doubling the supply of qualified candidates for a job might have an effect on salary growth. College are also allowed to, and usually do, present very misleading information about the value of the degrees they offer.  I won't go into all the shady stats I've seen here, but if you post a study, I will provide a detailed reply explaining why it's misleading, or if I can't, give you a delta.\n\nSo, we entered a contract with the government for a loan. But that contract was made based on information, assurances, and encouragement given by the government, in the most manipulative way possible (through authority figures from the time we could tie our shoes). That information was also false or greatly exaggerated. How is that not theft by fraud of the most disgusting kind?\n\nNot only that, but the product is grossly overpriced, which is a direct and easily foreseeable result of the current student loan program. If you extend students a nearly limitless line of credit that is non-dischargeable, and if you make an organized effort to push entire generations into college, it doesn't take a Gomer Pyle to see that this will lead to skyrocketing tuition rates. So now not only is Danny Devito rolling back the odometer, but now he's adding a 0 to the price tag too.\n\nAny reasonable member of congress should have also foreseen that putting billions of dollars on the table for colleges, completely free of any responsibility or risk, might incentivize those colleges to try to enroll more students. More students in a particular field means a higher supply of candidates, which lowers salaries. So not only do we pay so much more, but the value is so much less because of supply and demand. Not too mention the added perverse incentive to lower degree requirements to get more students through the door, which in turn makes a degree less valuable. Or the fact that we issue so many degrees that half of students who get them end up in jobs that didn't need them at all, meaning they spent all that money and time for nothing.\n\nIf I was going to design a student loan system that made a minimal effort to *appear* to help low-income Americans get opportunities, while my real goal was actually to funnel as much money as possible away from the poor and funnel it up to enrich lobbyists and my business donors, it would look exactly like the current system. The college admin are making sickening amounts of money, and a huge oversupply of graduates allows businesses to drastically cut wages. If you actually cared about helping people better their lives, there are a multitude of much better ways to provide educational opportunities to students. In fact, we would have been much better off if they had done nothing at all.\n\nSo either those who designed the current system did it in such a way to to extract wealth from the poor and give it to the rich while pretending to help the poor, which is evil. Or they made an exceptionally stupid decision that had disastrous consequences for future children, and they now expect those grown children to pay for their poor decisions, while also insulting them because at 18 they didn't have the critical thinking skills needed to realize what every trusted adult in their lives told them was not true. Which is still evil.",

  "selftext": "Hello!\n\nI am a 26 year old, Hungarian graduate student in physical chemistry. This for me had been arrived at taking one-step at a time, with vague notions and wishes for the future that were constantly reassessed based on political news.  I remember that when I was 15 years old, we've had school psychologists try and assess our maturities by investigating whether we could make long-term plans, and how complex they were.\n\nIt was, more or less, stated that if you are only living one step into the future at a time - you have fallen behind in development.\n\nI would like to argue against this on a few bases, and would like to be shown that either:\n\nA) Well-trained psychologists DO take these confounding factors into consideration when casting judgement/making statistics  \nB) The reasons I cited for why I think an informed inability to make long-term plans is actually a sign of developmental delay.\n\nAnecdotally, from the end of upper elementary school (grade 6-8) I'd made a long-term plan that I want to leave my home country for political reasons. I am a gay, transgender woman and I did not feel safe in my country both socially, and in terms of my ruling party's messaging. I specifically chose Denmark at the time as they were often ridiculed for being  [homophobic slur] by peers and \"mentor figures.\" Bohr also hailed from there and there is a decent tradition in theoretical physics/physical chemistry as a consequence.\n\nHowever, given my motivations I would never share this with any school psychologist and so, I'd ended up presenting \"for reasons\" as for why I want to move to Denmark. I believe this may have been interpreted as a sign of whimsical immaturity. This plan ended up being dropped though, as Denmark's politics grew more hostile to people like me as they've shown a rise in right wing influence. \n\nFurthermore, in a more general sense - I believe it takes naivete to make complex plans of one's future as it is impossible to predict what curve balls life will throw at you even next month (car accident, assault, infection, recession, inflation, caretaker death), much less 5-10 years into the future. Case in point, people who had made complex plans of moving to UK had their entire futures squashed by Brexit, a highly improbable event, happening and nullifying all their preparatory work. \n\nTherefore, an adolescent replying to questions on their long-term plans with vague wishes over a complex detail demonstrates greater insight and maturity.",

That's up from 5.6 billion when I was born in 1993, and 3 billion when my mom was born in 1960. \n\nIn fact, if you look at the [distribution of mammals by biomass](https://ourworldindata.org/wild-mammals-birds-biomass), humans represent 34% and human-owned livestock represents another 62%, leaving only 4% represented by wild mammals. \n\nHumanity is spreading across every square centimeter of inhabitable space on earth, paving it over in concrete and using up resources until nothing is left for literally any creature not belonging to the species of *H. sapiens*. The carbon footprint of one single human is over 1,000 metric tonnes in the US, and this number is comparable in most developed countries. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think all of the pro-environmental policies are great steps in the right direction. But our progress in reducing carbon footprints is quickly counteracted by making more and more humans. A 10% decrease in average carbon footprints per capita doesn't mean much when the population rises by the same amount. \n\nThe solution to all of this is obvious, but no one wants to hear it: we need less humans on earth. If we gradually returned to 1960s levels of humans, *and* we kept going with switching to renewables as best we can, the earth might have a fighting chance to heal and provide beautiful, natural space for all the biodiverse species that call this place home. \n\nMeanwhile, as soon as anyone advocates for population decrease, the uproar is immediate and usually based on economics. This is because our entire economic system is based on the premise of eternal growth. A company is only considered successful if it grows, and when one exists in stable equilibrium, it's considered failure. \n\nThe problem extends to governmental programs, too. Healthcare is funded by economic growth, and if we experienced population decline, the number of working people would fall and funds would become limited to pay for the ageing population's care. Our taxes are not saved and used later to pay for our own healthcare when we need it. Instead, they are used to pay for the previous generation, and it is assumed that there will be enough growth in working people to pay for the current generation when they age and need care. The system perpetuates a never-ending cycle. \n\nBut at some point, we need to face the music: if we don't start doing something radically different, the earth will be destroyed by humanity's need to spread like cancer.",

Men are expected to make the first move, take her out on a date, pick a nice spot, have good social skills to carry the conversation, pay for the date, be financially stable enough to provide for his woman to an extent, be a certain height and so on. I would argue that women don't have to put nearly as much work when it comes to dating and relationships than men. All a girl pretty much has to do is look decent, which men find the majority of women physically attractive enough to want to commit to them where as the same cannot be said the other way around. \nThere was a study done that over 60% of young men in their 20s are single where as it's only 33% for younger women. Why is this? Well it goes back to my original point that Women have dating on easy mode compared to men. Women have far more dating options than men especially younger ones. Now as women get older yes it's not nearly as easy because men are mainly attracted to beauty and aesthetics but I would then say women blew their chance of securing a guy when they were in their 20s. Part of that reason is because this generation of women are more career oriented so dating and relationships aren't as high on the priority list as previous generations. That's why when women hit 30 to 40 they might struggle to find a longtime partner because the man they want, wants the younger 25 year old woman. \nAlso I would say that men are far more easier to please in a relationship than women. Women often say they want someone who's 6ft or above, makes a high salary, and have all these charecteristics that only few men have. Where as men all they typically want is a woman who looks good and is easy to connect with personally.\nSo the traits & qualities that women find attractive in men are less common in men than the traits & qualities in women that men find attractive. \nSo all in all I think dating women have it on easy mode compared to men. Like I said before men have to do all the dirty work when it comes to approaching, handling rejection, paying for dates, being stable financially, having good charisma and so on. Men have to build themselves up in life if they want to attract women where as women they can attract men right off the bat with no effort because of their looks.

For context: I am a CS major with an interest in AI / ML. \n\nI'm going to list a few of the common arguments I get, as well as why I'm not convinced by their integrity. My stance comes from the fact that I believe something can only be unethical if you can reason that it is. In other words, I do not believe that I need to prove it's ethical- I just need to dismantle any argument that claims it isn't.\n\n**AI art steals from artists.**\n\nNo, it doesn't. This software is built off machine learning principles. The goal is to recognize patterns from millions of images to produce results. In simple terms, the goal is to create a machine capable of learning from artists. If the model made a collage of different pieces, then I'd agree that it's sketchy - AI art doesn't do that. If the model searched a database and traced over it somehow, then I'd agree - but AI art doesn't do that either. Does it learn differently from a human? Most likely, but that isn't grounds to say that it's theft. Consider a neurodivergent individual that learns differently from the artist- is it unethical for THAT person to look at an artist's work? What if he makes art in a different way from what is conventionally taught. Is that wrong because the artist did not foresee a human making art in that particular way?\n\n**Artists didn't consent to their work being learning material.**\n\nIf you're saying that, and you hold this view as uniformly true regardless of WHAT is learning from it, then sure. If you have the more reasonable stance that an artist cannot gatekeep who learns from the stuff they freely publish online, then that freedom can only logically extend to machines and non-humans. \n\n**Without artists, the models don't exist.**\n\nYou are right, there is no current way to build an ML model to produce artistic renditions without artists. This doesn't mean that artists should own the rights to AI art or that it is unethical. Consider the following: High-velocity trading firms rely on the fact that the internet allows them to perform a huge volume of trades at very high speeds. Without the internet, they cannot exist. Does that mean high-velocity trading firms are owned by the internet, or that they must pay royalties to someone? No. I cannot exist without my parents. Am I obligated to dedicate my life in service to them? No.\n\n**It steals jobs.**\n\nYes, it might. So did the computer to human calculators, the fridge to milkmen, and the telephone switchboard to switchboard operators. If you believe that this is the essence of why AI art is unethical, then I'm really curious to see how you justify it in the face of all the historical examples.\n\n**Only humans should be dealing in art.**\n\nI've had this argument a couple of times. Basically, it's the following: Only humans can make art. Because a machine creates nothing but a cheap rip-off, it's an insult to the humans that dedicate their lives to it.\n\nFor people that believe this: Are you saying that, of all the sentient species that might come to exist in the universe, we are the ONLY ones capable of producing art? Is every other entity's attempt at art a cheap rip-off that insults human artists?\n\n**The only ones using it are huge corporations.**\n\nNot only is this not true, it doesn't really do much to convince me that it's unethical. I am, however, interested in hearing more. My belief for this is the following: If even a SINGLE person can use AI art as a way to facilitate their creative process, then your argument falls.\n\n**It produces copies of artists' work. There are even watermarks sometimes.**\n\nYes. If your model is not trained properly, or not being used properly, then it is possible that it will produce near-identical copies of others' work. My counter has two parts to it:\n\n1. The technology is in its infancy. If it gets to the point where it simply does not copy-paste again, will you accept that it is ethical?\n2. When used improperly, it can produce near-copies of someone else's work. Just like the pencil. Is the pencil unethical?\n\n**Art will die.**\n\nSome artists believe that, because AI art is so easy to make and has no integrity or value, art will die. This implies that humans only make art for financial gain. No one is stopping humans from producing art long after the advent of AI models. \n\n**Unrelated arguments:**\n\n* It looks bad / humans are better at it.\n* It's not real art.\n* Doesn't require skill.\n\nI'll be adding any other arguments if I can remember them, but these are the central arguments I most often encounter.",

We shouldn't have massive companies like Blackrock owning thousands of own driving up the prices when they could be sold to the local communities. Homes should not be considering assets. They should not be considering a way to make money. Homes are where people live in. If you own five homes and you rent them all out all your doing is generating profit for something that should not be generating profit. I don't care about your summer home, your passive income, or your company. All I hear is someone trying to make money for doing nothing while other people are actually living in the home. If you could only own one home, the home you actually live in so many problems would be solved. Generational wealth would be forced to invest in other areas, real estate prices would plummet allowing more people to own a home instead of renting, local communities could thrive because they would encourage to settle down instead of constantly recoating to find affordable rent, etc. I have yet to hear a single reason why someone should be able to own multiple homes other than just pure greed.",

  "selftext": "EDIT: I was misinformed, it was not replacing it, just played alongside! I don’t think this is a big issue anymore, but I’m leaving the post up because there is interesting knowledge in here. Original Post as follows:\n\nTL:DR - I don’t feel like the National Anthem is problematic, and it is a long cultural tradition. Why should we replace it? (Especially when it will piss a lot of people off for seemingly little reason). It’s one thing to play this other national anthem alongside, another to replace the old one.\n\nSaw on here that they are replacing the National Anthem this year at the upcoming football games with the “Black National Anthem” (Lift Every Voice).\n\nI’m very liberal, but this feels kind of weird to me. It’d be one thing to sing this alongside The National Anthem, but it feels way over the line to replace this.\n\nI don’t feel a change like this is necessary because the National Anthem isn’t really even a problematic song. If anything, it’s a bit dull. But at any rate, it’s a tradition, and long traditions that don’t harm anyone or imply anything negative should be generally respected.\n\nI don’t really like the Lift Every Voice song either, because of the religious implications of the song, which (in my opinion) actually add problematic layers to it (think pledge of allegiance). It also doesn’t feel like it’s significant culturally. Is it even significant to black people? Aren’t there other folk songs that are more significant to black people? I truly don’t know.\n\nI don’t call many things virtue signaling, but this feels like very weird virtue signaling to me. I don’t quite understand the point. It seems like a change that will piss a lot of people off for very little reason. Not all traditions are bad, or imply systemic white supremacy.",

  "selftext": "The problems with alchohol are two fold. It's stranglehold on society, and it's effects on people.\n\nFirstly, the societal. You see alchohol everywhere, from Christmas to birthdays to halloween to just random days off, and more. it's like a plague of locusts. It's everywhere in pop culture and media too, and it's treated like this drink that makes you happy and able to have fun. It isn't.\n\nThis takes me into my next point. The effects it has on people. I have numbers for this. In the USA, According to the World Health Organization, domestic abuse victims had partners that drank alchohol before physical assault in 55% of all cases. 30% of aggrivated assault charges are from drunk people, according to the National TASC. Also from the national TASC:\n\n1: Between 29-40% of reported sexual assaults are from drunk people, and more probably go unreported.\n\n2: 38% of convicted murderers were intoxicated at the time of the crime. More than any other substance.\n\n3: 43% of child abusers were intoxicated whilst abusing the child.\n\n\nNeed I say more? Alchohol makes people into evil people, yet media and society at large pushes it as a good thing. This clearly shows that alchohol is one of the worst things humans have ever made.\n\nEdit: Formatting to make it easier to read.",

  "selftext": "I might be conflating unrelated things but this has been my singular experience.\n\nNo matter how superficial it is, if you don't exude traditional ideals of masculinity as someone assigned male at birth, there isn't a support group for you.\n\nWhen I hear so much about helping men's mental health and dynamic in the modern world, it's usually about protecting one's sense of masculinity, or comparing men to a social hierarchy like alpha, beta etc. that hominids don't inherently subscribe to based on gender and/or sex alone. Or that emotions or flashy styles are the center-point of emasculating someone. Some variation of disingenuous \"I support other men\", (but when men are like me and how I want them to be.) I often feel belittled when guys give me unsolicited advice, because it is typically a rejection of what is considered \"soft\"-- which is are at odds with my interests, personal tastes, and the type of social role I naturally assume most often (emotional caretaker.)\n\nI also have medical conditions and can't do powerlifting or strength-based strenuous exercises, with a list of other chronic health issues, so I laugh (and cringe) when I hear \"weak males\" are equated to not being bodybuilders or physically capable of strength or constitution. The comparisons are usually uninformed and reductive.\n\nTelling me how I should live my life isn't supportive. I'd rather someone meet me where I'm at and find value in who I am even if I'm considered feminine-- which isn't a bad thing, and also, why does it even matter? This exists even within the LGBT+ community, and I've been genuinely harassed regardless of the male-centered community because of how little I care about conformity.\n\nSo, I do not believe people when they say they care about men's mental health until they show that to me explicitly, by being an encouraging figure of other men who may not be like them. Something I rarely ever see, especially online.\n\nSo I'm jaded as shit, and I want to change this.\n\nI understand this view is informed more by trauma than logic. I've just never had a safe and healthy relationship with a group of solely men where I felt included.\n\nI want a reason to think otherwise, I want to be wrong.

  "title": "CMV: The \"protection from tyranny\" pro-2nd Amendment argument is intellectually dishonest",
  "selftext": "A common argument seen in favour of retaining the US's Second Amendment (2A), and keeping rules around gun ownership as un-restrictive as possible, is that such freedoms are necessary to give US citizens a means to defend themselves from the government in the event of a tyrannical takeover.\r  \n\r  \nThe argument goes that by allowing the US citizenry to arm themselves, in the event of a tyrannical overthrow of the US government and the cessation of the democratic process, US civilians can use the weapons they own (thanks to 2A) to overthrow the tyranny and restore democratic processes.\r  \n\r  \nThis argument is often seen as absurd because it assumes that an un-coordinated and poorly equipped (relative to the US Armed Forces) citizenry would somehow have the capacity to overwhelm/overthrow a tyrannical dictatorship. Yet 2A defenders point out that guerrilla tactics and other unconventional warfare means have been effective in the past in other situations, and could result in the toppling of a dictatorship in the US, were one ever to emerge.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, if this is true, and we accept pro-2A arguments that we believe that a tyrannical US could genuinely be overthrown by an armed pro-democracy citizenry, it also follows that a democratic US could be overthrown by an armed pro-tyranny citizenry. Arming a citizenry does nothing to ensure that their weapons will always be used in service of democracy. As has been seen thanks to events like 6/1/2021, it is wrong to assume the population will always be unambiguously on the side of democracy. They could be simply deceived that they are acting in the interest of free and fair elections, when the reverse is in fact true, or they could genuinely believe that democracy is no longer in their interest.\r  \n\r  \nEssentially, the reason the pro-2A \"protection from tyranny\" argument is intellectually dishonest is that an armed citizenry is at least as much a threat to the continuation of democracy as it is a threat to the emergence/continuation of tyranny, and if that's the case, protection against tyranny cannot be reasonably called an argument in favour of 2A/gun de-regulation.",

The French monitoring organization predicts a deficit over the next decade. People might say that even if this is true,  it is okay because not every government enterprise needs to turn a profit, but I disagree with this - the pension system is as of now France's biggest money sink, in a world where they simply cannot afford to be bleeding money -\n\n* France is not a fast-growing economy, they are expected to grow by only 1.5% max on average for the next 10 years, they are also in a uniquely bad time with the Ukraine war expected to go on for years, meaning their energy crisis isn't going to go back to the pre-2020 free Russian gas equilibrium, which will only make things harder, inflation is still pretty bad - this is not the kind of economy that can spend money without thinking about it, money is always limited, but for some countries, it is more limited than others, I'm not saying France shouldn't be spending money, but they have enough problems that I really don't think they need a money sink like this current pension system to deal with as well.  \n* Every Euro spent on the pension system is a euro that could have been spent on other programs that everyone including the French people think is a requirement - education, healthcare, poverty welfare schemes, I like pro-welfare policies, I think they help the people we need to help the most while also being able to boost your economy if done right, this actively gets in the way of it because as of the past 5 years, the pension system has been taking money from other govt expenditure pots to make up for their deficit. \n\nThis is not a sustainable system, and it clearly needs to change. I'm not saying the deficit needs to be completely eliminated, but the current severity of it is not acceptable, something has to be done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are two ways to change this - reduce the expenditure of the pension system, or increase the revenue/inflows of the system. Macron's solution is one that will reduce the expenditure, while alternatives like increasing the tax on people (whether it's just the rich or the middle class) would increase the inflow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe French people would have a problem with any expenditure reduction: whether it is reducing the pension amount, reducing the number of people to whom it is given, or as we see here an increase in retirement age - so those options are out. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see precious little discussion on why a tax increase on the average person or middle class is either fair or a viable option is given the current economic climate - Europe is dangerously close to a recession and is not expected to make a quick recovery anytime soon, this is the worst time to increase the tax burden on people because it will make the economy even weaker, and if a tax is imposed in the next year or two it has the real risk of driving growth rates to the negative, which in the past causes recessionary spirals that are incredibly hard to recover from. I'm not saying this solution is completely unreasonable, but no one from the french protestors camp, whether its people on the streets or political parties backing the protests or intellectuals backing the protests has put forward a convincing enough argument that there exists a tax increase which could solve this problem and not be disastrous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut more generally when it comes to taxation, even if you claim that you can get away with only taxing wealthy people who we don't care about losing money or incentive to work (I would argue in the current regime of rising interest rates in countries like the US imposing some sort of wealth tax while appealing would be catastrophic as it will incentivize short term capital outflow from France but lets even say thats not an issue) I disagree with the idea that this is a problem that can be solved by an increasing of some external tax - because if it is possible to increase the tax on the people (or rich) in some way, there is a good argument that this money should then go to more meaningful, structural investments that the country badly needs - like Healthcare, education, infrastructure etc (these also affect the most vulnerable most, these also affect the people the most, and these will help France keep its economy going and maybe modernize a bit making everyone more wealthy), so I am not convinced that a tax is the solution to this. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall, I don't see what the French people want. Finally, let me be clear on what I mean by \"unreasonable\", this is a nebulous word and people can easily say that nothing is every \"unreasonable\" because if the French people care deeply about something then they should be able to protest it end of story. For the purposes of this CMV, when I say unreasonable I mean I do not think that the people shouting fowl here have an alternate solution that is better for the nation as a whole in the medium / long term.",

In a [document](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-199015/) prepared by the UN in 1999, it says:\n\n\n>Article 49 of the 4th Geneva Convention is very specific in its reference to settlers or civilians of the occupying Power and states explicitly that \"the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. \"This article prohibits settlements in broad and unequivocal terms without regard to the purported purposes of the settlements and was created specifically to prevent the colonization that inevitably ensues with such population transfers\n\nThe General Assembly, including the UK and many in the West, has condemned the illegality of these settlements numerous times, the Security Council [passed a resolution](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/1696?ln=en) in 1979 declaring that these settlements have no legal validity, and the ICJ has [ruled](https://web.archive.org/web/20200913105418/https://www.icj-cij.org/files/case-related/131/131-20040709-ADV-01-00-EN.pdf) that the settlements violate international law, rendering them illegal. \n\nIf anyone wants to argue that the West Bank is not occupied territory, both ICJ and [UNSC](https://peacemaker.un.org/sites/peacemaker.un.org/files/SCRes242%281967%29.pdf) have ruled territories East of the Green Line to be occupied territory, and the rulings in the paragraph above presupposes West Bank as occupied territories too.\n\nThere is also [settler violence](https://www.btselem.org/topic/settler_violence) that Israel has failed to properly address, [doubly illegal settlements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_outpost) (illegal in Israeli law and international law) are not removed promptly and sometimes protected by the IDF. \n\nThese are all unjustified because they come at the expense of Palestinians, forcing them into an apartheid-like state, an obstacle for peace (as described by the US), and often leads to unnecessary arrests of Palestinians for retaliating against settler violence.\n\nIf the USA doesn't want to be hypocritical, they must unequivocally condemn Israel for illegal settlements, just as many countries in the West have done. It's not like it will hinder their ability to send military aid to Israel anyway because the UK have also made military deals with Israel.\n\nEdit: To clarify, declaring something illegal is not the same as condemning. Looking at the annexation of Crimea, many non-align countries declare the annexation and referendum illegal, or saying Ukraine's territorial integrity must be respected, but stop short of condemning Russia for it, because condemnation means something in diplomacy. If US condemns Israel tomorrow, for literally anything, it will permanently shift US-Israel relation because US has crossed a line that Israel didn't think they would cross.",

  "selftext": "I feel like most arguments against Batman are stupid. For example, \"he's a white billionaire that beats up poor people.\" Okay, for one, Batman beats up other white billionaires too, Penguin, and the other crime bosses that he goes against are white billionaires, and they actively poison Gotham and do more damage to the poor in Gotham with their criminal organizations, and the street thugs Batman beats up are actively trying to hurt and kill other people; it's kind of his job to stop them.\n\nEven if they are poor, these people are still choosing to mug or rob someone. It doesn't give them an excuse if Batman is on the roof and sees a man about to mug a pregnant woman. Is Batman supposed to be like, \"Oh, he's poor, so the fact that he's poking a gun at a pregnant woman is justified?\" No, he should stop them. My point is that class doesn't and shouldn't matter if you are a criminal rich or poor; you should be stopped. If someone is trying to steal from me or hurt me, I would want someone to stop them and help me. I don't care if that person is a billionaire or a poor person. Please stop the criminal from attempting to hurt me.\n\nBruce Wayne actually does help Gotham with his wealth; that's what all his non-profit organizations are for, and he treats and pays all his employees very nicely. That's why I kind of cringed at the line in The Flash (2022) movie when Batman had the lasso of truth. I get that it was supposed to be a joke, but it didn't make sense to me because Bruce Wayne does a bunch of stuff for Gotham with his wealth, but let's be honest, no one wants to see a Batman story where the entire story is Bruce Wayne at non-profits and doing stuff with his wealth to help Gotham. A lot of people want to see Batman in the Batmobile fighting crime, and I don't know why this argument gets used against Batman and not any other billionaire superhero.\n\nI also don't think it makes sense for Thomas Wayne to be corrupt. The Wayne family comes from old money. Thomas inherits his wealth, so for him to be a crime boss makes no sense. I could understand if he wasn't a billionaire and went through exploitative, corrupt means to get his billions, but he didn't. The Wayne family ancestors may have been corrupt and exploited people, but Thomas and Bruce didn't do anything except be born, so like I said, it doesn't make sense for Thomas to be a crime boss and Bruce to be evil.\n\nThomas Wayne wasn't the CEO of Wayne Enterprise; he was the owner and maybe a CEO in a figurehead type of way, but he was a surgeon first and foremost, so it doesn't make sense for him to be corrupt. I have also heard the argument that Batman glorifies billionaires and that we shouldn't like Batman because he glorifies rich people. This doesn't make any sense to me at all. Like I said, why does this only apply to Batman and no other billionaire hero? Also, Bruce Wayne didn't do anything; he was born into a rich family and inherited their wealth. That is, he didn't do anything wrong. And if Batman wasn't a billionaire, then his story wouldn't make sense. People would ask, \"How does a regular person leave town at 17, train for a bunch of years, come back, and be able to afford all these suits, gadgets, and cars?\" \n\nI'm pretty sure Bruce donates his wealth a lot more than any other rich superhero like Iron Man, Green Arrow, et cetera. Another argument that doesn't make sense to me is \"He recruits children!\" Every single superhero has recruited a child. Bucky was a literal child in the comics, and Captain America brought him along to fight Nazis in World War II. Every member of the Justice League has a kid sidekick, and before you say, \"Well, they have powers,\" it doesn't matter if a child is put in active danger; it doesn't matter if they have powers or not. The last time I checked, the Teen Titans were kids fighting grown adult villains, and the Titans can still die. I don't know why these arguments get used against Batman, and no one else.\n\nI feel like these arguments are stupid, and the people who use them don't know anything about Batman. I feel like these people have seen clips of Batman from movies and TV shows and think they know everything about characters, and I really don't understand why these arguments only get used against Batman and not any other rich superhero but feel free to CMV.",

I think there is a time and place for everything. And I personally love twitch because it's a platform focused on gamers enjoying other gamers playing games or talking about games. It also helped to normalize gaming and fights the stigmas that existed where gamers are losers, girls don't game or they are bad at gaming etc. it also helped to fight the stigma that a \"gamer girl\" is just woman dressed somewhat sexually with colored hair. I also like that kids and teens (male and female)  would go on the platform and enjoy it's content without the worry of being exposed to NSFW content. \n\nNow all of that progress will be lost. I have family members and friends with kids who have caught their kids looking and or listening to NSFW streams. And as someone who watches streams on twitch I sometimes see these 18+ streams popping as recommendations. I'm not against sexual content in general. Not do I moralize sex or anything of that sort. However when I see content creators on there engaging in NSFW suggestive activities (teasing) and recommending their audience to join their OF. It's just perpetuating the issue of boys and girls being overly exposed to NSFW content. It also brings body image issues and how women and men objectifying each other. Yes, there filters implemented and age restriction stuff that could be used. And yes, one could argue that the parents should monitor their kids viewing activities. But no one is going sit and actually watch their kids watch video streams. \n\nWhy does that type of content needs to be on a game streaming platform? Idk, I'm just sick of see young men and women being exploited and over exposed that that type of content. Maybe twitch should create a separate platform that type of content. \n\nThere is the policy update:\n\n[NSFW policy update](https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Updating-our-Approach-to-Sexual-Content-and-Content-Classification-Labels?language=en_US)",

  "selftext": "Note: This is written from an American driving perspective, so it may not match up with how laws or views of driving in other countries work.\n\nMy view is that speeding is not necessarily a dangerous act - nor even one that should be harshly enforced - as much as reckless driving is. I understand that \"reckless driving\" is a pretty vague term, so I'll elaborate on my title here.\n\nIn my view, reckless driving is the real cause of accidents, which speeding may be a part of. This doesn't mean that speeding itself is necessarily dangerous. For example, it would be reckless to go 30 or more over the speed limit in a residential neighborhood where the speed limit is, say, 20 miles per hour. This would put you at 50 mph in an area that usually has narrow roads, obstructions, kids/animals that might dash into the road, and foot traffic. This would be reckless, thus speeding would be dangerous.\n\nHowever, adapt this to a highway situation, and going 30 miles over a speed limit of 70 is not necessarily dangerous. On a freeway, everyone is going fast - so much so that going slow is often more harmful than matching the speed of traffic. In some areas (Miami comes to mind,) going the speed limit is actually *too slow* compared to the speed of the cars around you, so speeding is a safer maneuver than going the speed limit, as your slow speed will impede the flow of traffic and put you at risk for an accident.\n\nBut it's not as simple as residential vs freeway. It's also important to take into account traffic conditions and the density of cars on the road. For example, I would frequently take an interstate connecting my state to reach the other side, and it would be rare to see more than 0-3 cars at any point in time. In this case, it is not at all a danger to go vastly over the speed limit. It is a long, flat road designed for high speeds, with no surrounding woods (thus, animals,) or curves to present any danger. \n\nThe last example is similar to the Autobahn in Germany, which often does not have speed limits at all, except in residential or risky areas as outlined above.\n\nHowever, if you take that interstate example and apply it to a busy, winding road, then it certainly is risky to be going over the speed limit. You will have to be weaving between cars and taking sharp turns to navigate the road's curvature. In that case, speeding is dangerous.\n\nSo, CMV that speeding is inherently dangerous.",

A few examples of this can be the fact male chicks in poultry farming are often crushed alive, we seperate animals from their mothers, we hunt animals for sport, we keep chickens who do get to live in what are effectively little cubicles without sunlight, only with food, water, and a place for eggs to be layed into. and in the pork industry we often snip the tails of pigs when they are young, we also often intentionally damage the beak of birds so they cant kill each other in those  massive complexes.\n\nnow with this knowledge, say you are a sheep, and you are approached by a man from wales. two things could happen, you could be killed and eaten, often not in a quick and painless way, or you could be shagged. im sure we would all choose the latter option.\n\nanother argument that can be demonstrated is that consent would not matter as animals already do not have it as a concept, they just do sex, unless it was actually violent i dont think it can be shown that they would be disturbed by this. its not like dogs for example ask each other if they are okay with it before doing it, they just do it, so why would it matter if it was between species and no real harm was being done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthus this concludes my several arguments for why i think it is morally acceptable to do beastiality, and have explained why i think its much better than what we already do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1 : I have realized part of the way i have phrased this has made it out seem the point i was making is \"we do x to animals, thus you should allow me to do y\", and while that could work, my point was rather to show the societal hypocrisy and to address arguments of harm in advance. to say that beastiality is harmful you would need to demonstrate it, thus as it stands to me it is at the least morally neutral.",

  "title": "CMV: The real danger to our society does not come from extremist politics, but from journalists who exploit their narratives to make a lot of money.",
  "selftext": "Hello dear community,\n\n~~I would like to start my argumentation with a quote often attributed to Voltaire:~~\n\n~~\"To learn who rules over you, find out who you are not allowed to criticize.\"~~\n\n~~This quote is often taken to convey the idea that those who suppress discussions and criticism are often the ones wielding oppressive power in society. When examining societal discourse, people often focus on criticizing the opposing political side, which is quite normal in a democracy.~~\n\nThe issue, in my view, lies in the authority that sets the foundation for these discussions. While there are official sources directly from parliaments that accurately and neutrally document what has transpired, few individuals have the time to read through all of it. Instead, we rely on news media to filter out the (supposedly?) important information and present it to the reader. This wouldn't be a problem if the subsequently published news were not being reinterpreted by the author.\n\nThe problem with online news media is that they are primarily financed through advertising rather than subscriptions and impulse purchases. A single click is the most valuable, and obtaining it is crucial. The risk of publishing a bad piece of news, not getting clicks, and consequently not earning advertising revenue is much greater than with print media, which employs a subscription model and still receives money upfront even if an editorial is not widely read. They would still receive the money if the magazine were bought at the kiosk because no one really reads the entire magazine before buying it.\n\nTo maximize clicks on an article, news media must employ tactics to lure the online reader, who has a wide array of choices, to their own site. This is where the tricks come into play: emotional and sensational headlines get clicked more often than sober and neutral ones. However, not every event in our society is emotional and sensational. In fact, very few are. To present neutral news as sensational and emotional as possible without altering the truth, internet media resorts to some tricks:\n\nFor example, in a city X, a person has died. Due to the stab wounds, it is suspected that the person was murdered with a knife, and the police are investigating for murder and have arrested some individuals, including a foreigner.\n\nThe neutral headline would read:\n\n\"Police Investigate Suspected Murder in City X\"\n\nSo far, so neutral. However, that's not brutal enough for the journalist, so let's add some brutality:\n\n\"Police Investigate Bloodbath in City X\"\n\nDo you see how the \"suspected\" can be dropped? Because the crime scene was full of blood, regardless of whether it was murder or not. If an foreigner is among the arrested individuals, let's add that:\n\n\"Police Investigate Foreigner for Bloodbath in City X\"\n\nEverything is still true. An investigation is ongoing against a foreigner, and there was a bloodbath. However, for the reader, it may appear as if the foreigner is the only arrest in the investigation. The reader is led to think that the foreigner caused the bloodbath because he is (apparently) the only one arrested. To perfect the reader's pre-judgment, let's leave out the investigation and simply pose the question:\n\n\"Did a Foreigner Cause the Bloodbath in City X?\"\n\nSo, we avoid making a factual claim and instead ask a question.\n\nIn my opinion, something fundamental needs to change in the news culture of the internet. Online news media have a financial incentive to divide society and post sensational news. Otherwise, we will approach the end of democracy with eyes wide open.\n\n**Edit:** Thank you for pointing out the dark background behind the supposed Voltaire quote. It's quite ironic that I myself quote something sensationalistic and evidently didn't adequately research the origin of the quote.\n\n**Edit2:** Thank you first of all for the many comments. I believe the irony of my own post, as described by many here, has shown me that I've let myself be convinced by my own anger towards certain news outlets. It is indeed the case that I wrote this post after reading an article that had pushed me over the edge. Nevertheless, I don't want to delete this post. On one hand, I want to keep it for other Reddit users who may have also fallen victim to this blind anger. On the other hand, I don't want to erase the good arguments that have been written under this post. I want to make it clear once again: My view has definitely changed. The world is a bit more complex than for me to solely blame a single industry. Additionally, some of the media I criticized are under the influence of extremist forces (who created these websites themselves), making it unfair to hold the entire journalism accountable. Also, thanks for pointing out the difference between reporters and editors.",

Why would you not make yourself look more attractive? Being good looking affects pretty much every aspect of your social life. People perceive you more positively in pretty much every way.

To further clarify, the US government’s aim has not been to commit a genocide. Doesn’t mean groups were not killed and I am not saying it makes it better or worse because of the motive. \n\nRussia/Soviet, France, Germany, Belgium (not a super power but an example), China & Japan have all just straight up massacred swaths of people under direction of their leaders.

So cases like the trail of tears, the US in the Philippines and of course (indirectly) we destabilized many Latin American countries that caused (continues to cause) a bad situation for many. \n\nYou have to keep in mind that a majority of the Atlantic Slave Trade was committed by the Europeans and the US stopped it shortly (comparatively) after their founding.

  "title": "CMV: Leviticus is not anti-LGBTQ",
  "selftext": "I should clarify my stance: The Leviticus passages do not contain a blanket condemnation of homosexuality or any message that when looked at within its historical context reads that way unambiguously. Originally I was going to do the entire Bible, but I thought this would get too long so I just wanted to do Leviticus. \n\nI should also clarify I don’t know Greek or Hebrew but will be attempting to rely on literal translations from those instead of poor English translations just to make the  true ambiguous nature of the verses in question shine through. \n\nI’ll address the clobber passages, these being Leviticus 20:13 and 18:22, \n\nLeviticus 18:22 literally says: *“And with a male do not lie down the lyings of a woman abomination it is.”* The phrase “lyings of…” used here is the the plural construct form of ‘mishkav’, (mishkevei) used only one other time in Genesis 49:4 and that is typically translated as bed. The passage reading in the KJV reads *“Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's **bed**; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.”* This is in reference to, Reuben, who slept with Jacob’s concubine, Bilhah. If one were to apply the same usage of mishkevei as was used in Leviticus, you find that the meaning is essentially “Reuben had sex with Bilhah as with his father”. Obviously Reuben doesn’t have sex with his dad so it appears that he was violating his dad by having sex “as if he *was* his father” in so far that he is taking his sexual role by engaging with his concubine. This kind of hierarchy of sex appears quite common in the Ancient Near East. It used to be taboo for your wife to be on top because it robbed the man of his vitality. I’ll get into this more when talking about Paul which I may do in another post to address Corinthians.\n\n Anyways, with that in mind, it appears that this usage, when applied to Leviticus, greatly changes the meaning. It is not about homosexuality or homosexual sex, it would be about violating the sexual hierarchy by having sex with a man as if he was a woman. I’ve already seen it argued that it’s clarifying that sleeping with a man while cheating on your wife is the meaning. This is consistent with the usages of singular usages of mishkav which are used for adultery. This reading is seen in the Nedarim 51a as well, with the rabbi being told the Leviticus passages referred to engaging with a man outside of engagement with his wife. \n\nObviously the interpretation changed over time, every text needs to be negotiated with , but I believe the intent was not a simple ban on homosexuality or a blanket condemnation of homosexual male sex either. The Ancient Near East didn’t have any concept of homosexual or heterosexual and based the motivations for sexual acts into completely different categories than we do today. These passages also completely leave out lesbian relationships, likely because women weren’t of concern when it came to the sexual hierarchy.",

  "selftext": "You may have heard it said that “guns are the leading cause of death in children” in America. Politicians and celebrities of various levels have made this assertion up to the President.\n\nPolitifact rates this claim, that guns are the leading cause of death in children, as “mostly true”\n\nhttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/jun/04/charles-schumer/among-children-firearms-leading-cause-death-2020/\n\nhttps://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2023/mar/29/ashbey-beasley/gun-violence-surpasses-car-accidents-leading-cause/\n\nTo my layman’s view, there are three problems with this analysis.  \n\nFirst, and I can believe this was innocent: Babies are excluded due to the unique health challenges they have. I’m willing to believe that that is something ordinarily done, although I believe they should have put that exclusion in the headline given babies are unquestionably children. \n\nSecond, the inclusion of ages 18-19 into the data set. According to the WHO, “an adult is a person older than 19 years of age unless national law delimits an earlier age.” In America, virtually every state sets majority at 18. But, I can believe this is innocent too. \n\nThird, the ungrammatical distribution of “leading cause of death” to both constituents of the set “children and teens” when in fact it applies only to the set in aggregate and to teens, not to children. That it is only true of teens is conceded in the second Politifact article\n\nTo believe Politifact and anyone who knows the truth on the data and who continues to assert that guns are the leading cause of death among children, it is equally true that heart disease is the leading cause of death among children, if you define the set as “children and people over 65” and again ungrammatically distribute. For that matter, death by heart disease due to older people so dwarfs other causes of death in the United States that we can conclude that heart disease is the leading cause of death for children, teens, young adults, etc. by the same wordplay.\n\nBut, whether people who cite their data are dishonest does not mean the study authors themselves were dishonest.\n\n(Edit: it was already shown the following would not work) **To earn the delta, all anyone has to do is cite 2+ medical studies which make the same error, and not on a politically charged topic** (for simplicity, let’s define that non-exhaustively as not involving violent trauma from any source. This is overbroad, but there are so many mundane health issues I think it would be a bad sign if we had to revisit this limitation) \n\nFor a purely hypothetical example, some study which said that skin cancer was the leading cancer among Non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans, when in fact it was true only for the set in aggregate, but not African Americans specifically would serve as one of the two. It would not do to say that skin cancer was the leading cancer in the United States, but would have to specifically say “X is true of Y and Z” when it is only true of “Y and Z” and not “Z” only. “X is true of Y, which is the set of A and B” would not work.",

I don‘t mean to detract from this at all. \n\n(Note: I’m going to use “women” as a stand in for birthing parent and “men” as a stand in for non-birthing parent. It’s may be less inclusive but it gets the point across better.)\n\nHowever, we don’t talk much about how the loss of abortion rights affects men. With abortion being stripped away:\n\n1. Men are responsible for raising unplanned children that they may not have the financial ability or other resources to raise.\n2. Especially if the woman is unwilling or unable to raise the child, the male parent will be left on the hook.\n3. If women are forced to go through with risky pregnancies they may die, and the male parent will end up being single fathers left to raise the other kids. (This almost happened to a man I know personally, who would have had to raise 6-7 children by himself if his wife had died in a risky unplanned pregnancy. In this case abortion was recommended by the doctor, but would likely have been forbidden in Texas for example.)\n4.  Men who want to have children will have a harder time finding a willing partner because the risks of childbearing are increased.\n5. Men will be pushed into having vasectomies, as an effective but permanent birth control method because condoms and the pill are not 100% effective. This takes away their ability to have children if their circumstances change in the future.\n\nThis might seem like an asshole take. All 5 of these issues affect women as well and in all of these cases women are much more affected then men. Pregnancy can be fatal, and many state do not provide adequate protection to protect the pregnant person’s health.\n\nHowever, I think it’s still important to include men in the discussion. They are losing rights, too, even if indirectly. I think men will be more motivated to actively defend abortion rights if they see it as an issue that significantly limits the choices they are able to make with their partner rather than as a “women’s right” that doesn’t really affect them. \n\nYet I’m not sure I’ve ever seen abortion discussed in this way.",

Bearing this in mind, I will use a comparison with another term, being an adoptive father or being an adoptive son, although an adoptive father will never be the real father, and he knows it, it is wrong to point that out to him, and in the same way if the adoptive father takes his non-biological son to the doctor knows that he should say the biological part, but that does not make him less of a father.\n\n2. *Post-sex transphobia*\n\nIf someone physically attracts you and you sleep with him/her because of how he/she looks (just sex and nothing in a long-term relationship) it doesn't affect you in any way whether or not he/she is trans, in case he/she hasn't had surgery or something doesn't affect you. attract at the time of the act you have 100% the ability to leave and it is not transphobia, but if the way it looks attracts you and later you realize that it is, you realize that it is trans, it does not affect you at all.\n\nI think this kind of thinking is associated with masculinity, that for example the sexuality of the butt, pawns or everything that is not penetration are considered less men for this reason, hence the insecurity when it comes to a trans person, if you liked it on the spot and you gave your consent there is nothing wrong with that, it is just your insecurities. \n\n3. *A trans person does not have to announce that they are trans*\n\nThis is my weakest point and it is based on the previous point\n\nIf you have an aversion to sleeping with a person of X political or religious position, it is not the responsibility of the other person to notify you in case you have a certain aversion, if it is true that a trans person is better off notifying them so as not to be in danger as they are a vulnerable population, but They shouldn't have to live in fear and in an ideal world they wouldn't have to warn, whoever approaches them and flirts with them and likes them shouldn't expect them to warn them all because of their own mental problems, if they're transphobic they may as well ask\n\nThis point is weak because I compare it with if you sleep with someone and then you realize that they have a partner, many feel betrayed and it hurts them to realize that they were part of an infidelity, at that point warning is cordiality but again it is not a duty of the person to warn you, if you have an aversion to it you can ask\n\nThanks for reading and I look forward to answers, please take it seriously as I plan to take the answers seriously",

  "title": "CMV: Regardless of your feelings about former president Trump, he cannot and should not be banned from appearing on state ballots in the 2024 election.",
  "selftext": "There have been a number of efforts as of late to bar former president Trump from appearing on the ballot in the 2024 election, and these efforts are getting a frankly alarming amount of support. Regardless of your opinions of the man, he should not be disqualified from at least appearing on the ballot next year, especially the primary ballot.\r  \n\r  \nThe people arguing that the 14th amendment can ban people from running for office are misguided. There is a massive difference between appearing on the ballot for an office, and actually being seated in that office, especially when it comes to the presidential race. First off, the amendment at the time could not possibly have been intended to disqualify people from the ballot, because government printed ballots didn't exist in the US until over 20 years later. Elections before the 1890's were conducted by letting each person turn in their own ballot featuring whichever candidates they wanted. Parties would each print their own respective ballots for voters to sign, if those voters supported that party's candidates, and otherwise they were welcome to make their own ballot. There was thus not a single ballot to qualify for— anyone could put you on their ballot if they so wished. The introduction of government printed ballots and ballot access laws were in some ways actually highly detrimental to democracy in general, but I digress— in any case, the 14th amendment, passed in the 1860's, could not possibly have given anyone the authority to ban a candidate from running for office. \r  \n\r  \nThere are two further points that are relevant to the 2024 presidential election. First of all, primary elections don't elect anyone! Being as they simply determine who a party's nominee is for a given election, they themselves don't elect any office holders. If you think about it, a large amount of people who win primary elections don't go on to hold the office that the general election is for. Thus, people can potentially win primaries for offices they don't qualify to run for at the time of the primary, assuming they can meet the qualifications by the time of the general election. Roque de la Fuente, for instance, was a businessman who ran for US Senate in nine different states in 2018 at the same time. He lost top-two primaries in California and Washington, and Republican primaries in seven other states. Despite the fact that being a resident of the state you are elected from is an explicit qualification to be elected US Senator, that didn't matter for purposes of the primary— If he had managed to win any of the nine primaries, he could have moved to that state before the general election and been perfectly fine.\r  \n\r  \nWhat's more is that the presidential election that people vote on is technically an election for presidential electors, not for the presidency itself. If it did turn out Trump was unqualified to serve as president (I'm not saying whether he is qualified to serve here, by the way; simply to be on the ballot), it is possible for those electors to cast ballots for alternative candidates. Despite the fact that some states have laws against these so-called \"faithless electors\", if it looked clear, with a majority of winning electors being republicans, that the only way to get a republican president would be for those republican electors to vote for an alternative candidate proposed by the party, the republican-dominated supreme court would almost definitely withdraw their approval of faithless elector laws in order to secure a win for their party. It would be controversial, sure, but the court isn't exactly non-partisan. In any case, having an unqualified nominee for president wouldn't prevent their chosen electors from winning the election, because that doesn't really make sense— Trump's electors would certainly be qualified to be electors, considering there are virtually no restrictions on who electors are allowed to be.\r  \n\r  \nThen, there is the fact that the disability imposed by the fourteenth amendment is allowed to be removed by Congress at any time. Say through some political miracle that republicans win supermajorities in both houses in 2024, or at least secure the two-thirds threshold in both houses necessary to allow an insurrectionist to become president through some sort of compromise. Trump theoretically could be seated as president even if he engaged in insurrection, and that might not become clear until after the election. To bar him preemptively, when he might later become qualified, would be paradoxical. At the end of the day, it is formally Congress' job to determine if the votes cast by electors are for a qualified candidate.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, this says nothing about whether Trump should or shouldn't be president. I'm personally against the man, but I think that not only is there no authority to say he is barred from state ballots under the 14th, the backlash against such efforts (which are already in their beginning phases) are inevitably going to be ruinous. January 6th was bad, and I am a bit fearful of a reprisal, but barring Trump from the ballot would only make his supporters more radical, and calamity more imminent.\r  \n",

On a personal level, they can all go to hell for all that I care. I hope every time someone displays a swastika in public, they face consequences for those actions from those around them.\n\nBut that being said, I don't think the answer is to make it illegal for individuals to share their views in a public space. It is easy to make these choices when it comes to something like a Nazi symbol, but allowing the government to ban any speech that is not posing an immediate threat is a dangerous precedent. For example, in the US, many politicians would love to ban the display of the pride flag and other symbols they consider to be, \"hateful.\" If we allow whoever is currently in office to declare which symbols can be expressed and which statements can be made, I believe it establishes a dangerous precedent that could erode free speech in the long term. \n\nIf a view is wrong, I believe it is on each of us to call that out in public, especially if you are not a part of the group that is the target of hate. Your workplace, family, and friends are all free to make choices about you based on what you say. But legislation is not the answer because it allows politicians to decide which views can be expressed and which cannot. Unless the speech poses an immediate threat to others (such as yelling fire in a crowded theatre, or calling for immediate violence), banning any form of speech is a bad idea in a free and fair society.",

  "selftext": "Note: in this post I'm using \"democracy\" to describe any system of government where power is derived from legitimate elections. The debate about whether our representative form of government was ever a true \"democracy\" is another topic entirely.\n\nThe US has long had a two-party democratic system. Now, one of the two parties is openly un-democratic. They support a candidate who already attempted one coup to overthrow an election, and who openly wishes to be a dictator. So from my perspective, that party is no longer participating in the democratic process, which leaves us with a... one-party democracy? Is that even a democracy at all?\n\nIn 2020 Biden ran on the premise of saving democracy from Trump. Now, entering the next election, democracy seems *even farther* from \"being saved,\" and Biden is running on the same premise again. Frankly, it seems a lot like the rhetoric from self-labeled but widely accepted to be undemocratic regimes like Russia and China; \"you must vote for THE party or doom us all.\"\n\nIt seems to me that the only way out of this situation is to create a viable third-party (or rather, 2nd party, if you assume that the Republicans are not participating in democracy). If the Democratic Party is serious about \"saving democracy,\" then they should be acknowledging the vast differences between their constituents (currently, anyone who still wants the US to operate as a democracy), dividing themselves into factions (sub-parties or new parties altogether), and forming a coalition of those factions to elect leaders through a democratic process (e.g. serious primary elections for president).\n\nIs there something I'm missing? Or is the idea basically just to stall for 4 more years and then have real primaries in 2028, assuming that somehow the specter of a Republican/anti-democratic victory will just disappear before then?\n\nEdit: holy heck that's a lot of comments. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Let me respond to a common one here: \"so you think handing Republicans a win will somehow help?\" Absolutely not. A Republican win speeds along the failure of democracy. A Democratic win delays it. A third-party win, while exceedingly unlikely, would be the only way to 'save' democracy. There could conceivably be a middle ground where Democrats win with a third-party receiving enough support to appear viable in a future election.\n\nEdit2: Another common argument is that we just need to wait out Trump personally, until he either dies or can't run. On this, I fundamentally disagree. I believe Trump showed the Republican party just what's possible to achieve by disregarding Democratic institutions and norms. I believe that there's a whole other wave of, frankly much more capable, Republicans waiting to follow his blueprint in the future.\n\nFinal edit: I gotta move on with my day. The general response seems to be \"suck it up for 4 more years, do something in the next primary. By then the Republicans will have changed.\" I think you're wrong. I don't think they'll change. I don't think they have any reason to do so. But I hope you're right.",

  "title": "CMV: Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is not \"real\"",
  "selftext": "Dissociative Identity Disorder, formerly known as multiple personality disorder or Split personality disorder is described as being when a single person's mind gets fragmented into two or more personalities due to early child hood trauma which causes their identity to become fractured as a defense mechanism.  Despite being included in the DSM-5 I think there is good reason to doubt the condition's validity.  Also, disclaimer, I am a layperson, I am not a mental health professional, nor do I have any background in psychology outside of reading a few books and articles.  If I am wrong about anything, please correct me. \n\nMy main issue with DID is the premise, that is to say, that a single person can have more than one personality.  The way I view it, personality is probably a function of both nature and nurture, nature being things like genes, our brain chemistry, hormones etc. and nurture being things like early childhood experiences, major life events, trauma, etc.  When you think about it, this already sheds doubt on many claimed cases of DID.  If I, an adult, claim to have one personality that a child this does not make sense because children and adults have different brains and different hormones, both of which effect behavior and personality.  If I claim to have one personality that is a police officer, it does not make sense either because I am not a police officer, and so I do not have the memories or experiences of one, and so those things cannot in turn effect me in any real way.  Of course, it is probably true that most people have personalities that shift gradually over time, however the notion that this is enough to make someone's personality bounce back and forth between 2 or more distinct states seems suspect to me, since generally, our biology and life experiences are pretty stable day to day.  Barring any sort of illness major life event, when I wake up tomorrow, I will have 99.9% of the same nature that I did yesterday, and 99.9% of the same nurture, and so I can expect my personality to be 99.9% the same.  \n\nMy second big issue with DID is the claim that it effects 1% to 1.5% of the general population, A stat I have read on both Wikipedia and The New York Times  (The article is titled \"What Does it Really Mean to Disassociate\"), with the NYT article speculating that this is probably an underestimate.  My intuition tells me that this stat is not in line with reality.  Think about that for a second; DID is on one hand so poorly understood and was virtually unheard of before the 1980s, and yet so common that most people should probably know at least one person who has it.   Of course, if this figure is incorrect, it does not necessarily prove that all DID is fake, but it does at the very least make us wonder if maybe groups like the APA are wrong about it in some fairly major way\n\nIn my title, I put the word \"real\" in quotes.  This is because though I do not think DID is real, I do not think that people diagnosed with DID are necessarily pretending to be sick.  In my opinion, it is likely that people who have DID have some sort of other mental health condition which would allow us to explain DID behavior without needing to resort to Freudian woo-woo about a splintered psyche.

  "selftext": "\r  \nThis is a slight change on a previous opinion I had and changed so let's go. Usually, when people think about what is in the way of opposite sex friendships, we're thinking about 2 people being attracted to each other directly, but this is not the only issue. The thing is that we don't wear our attractions on our foreheads, so for most people it's assumed, rightly or wrongly, that they're attracted to members of the opposite sex, and this dynamic is what shapes the realm of social interaction and social assumption.\r  \n\r  \nOne good way to look at it is the coffee and snacks test. Let's say I'm a guy and I'm attracted to nobody, and I'm in a lab group where most people are meh or have a bad attitude but there's this one girl who is generally having a good attitude and at least attempts to spread positivity. If I ask her, \"hey we should get coffee or snacks next week. You down?\" She is going to inevitably interpret this as a sexual advance, because the hanging out of a guy and girl one on one is considered sexual in our society.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, if she were to have a boyfriend, in all likelihood, that boyfriend would not like us hanging out one on one alone outside of work/school related reasons. Let's be real. Despite what we hear on Reddit, most guys are not OK with their girlfriends hanging out one on one with other dudes, and even though I'm not at all attracted to the girl in this scenario, and the guy probably does trust his gf, the simple fact is the guy is unlikely to trust me based on the simple social norms of what he will think my intentions are.\r  \n\r  \nWhere I've changed my opinion from last time is that I think if you can somehow overcome these barriers, that you can be close friends, but also, there will still be boundaries present that aren't present with the same sex that make it not the same. For example, I doubt that a girl in a relationship is kissing her guy friends on the cheek or posting Instagrams with the guy. Also, girls, regardless of who they're attracted to, tell other girls \"I love you\" all the time, but you'd never see a girl with a boyfriend say \"I love you\" to another guy or let another guy tell her ILY either. Also, girls sit on each others laps all the time but they wouldn't sit on a guy's lap while in a relationship with another guy.

  "selftext": "I think the understanding of white privilege has been engrained into so many people’s minds that they think being white is always an advantage anywhere. I don’t think that applies to rap. \n\nBeing white, there is already some bias against you. Certain topics, people will assume you have no way of relating to(which tends to be true even for black rappers but there’s a clear difference in how fake black rappers and fake white rappers get treated). You could grow up in the poorest gang-infested spot and spend your entire life around black folk and then get told you’re faking being black if you then naturally have an accent and participate in a culture people associate with black people. Essentially, trap and hard rap is out.\n\nYou could try to be more lyrical but by now, white lyrical rappers are somewhat of a meme. Good luck not becoming just another “spiritual lyrical miracle” type. I can’t think of anyone who’s broken into the mainstream with it whereas with black rappers, you’ve got J Cole, Lil Wayne, and Kendrick Lamar, and to a lesser extent JID and MF DOOM. Of course, part of this is because they lean more into storytelling rather than flexing lyrical prowess but going back to my first point, people often dismiss your story when you’re white.\n\nYou could go the exact opposite and focus much more on your production like Yeat who has pretty much abandoned the English language. But being white isn’t an advantage here. Starting out, most people thought he was black, made excuses that he couldn’t be white because he was half Mexican, and begged him to say the n-word because it would sound harder at certain points.\n\nThinking of white rappers, I can think of maybe one that has benefitted from being white and that’s supposedly Jack Harlow. Now I personally don’t think he actually has. I think he’s just attractive with a smooth voice and natural charisma. When What’s Poppin blew him up, nobody was saying “he’s only popular because he’s white.” Because that would be ridiculous as most people just liked the song. But once he failed to live up to expectations in Come Home The Kids Miss You(a pop-ish album playing into the fact that so many girls liked him because of previously stated smooth voice), all of a sudden, he’s a fraud who got where he is because of his skin color. Even with his newest album getting some respect for delving into a much rawer and more personal side with a much more rap-like sound, you’ll have people saying that if he was black, this would just be a mid album. It hardly seems like a boon to be a rapper that is white when you’ll get underrated by people and hated simply because you’re white. There is no “novelty” factor in being white. Record labels don’t hire you because you’re white. There’s no benefit.",

Military force has two goals: 1) To deter the enemy from making war; 2) To destroy the enemy's capability to make war.\n\n1) A priori, Hamas and its sympathizers will never be deterred from making war.  They know what the Israeli response will be, they count on it.\n\n2) Any reduction in the capability of Hamas to make war will be fleeting and temporary at best.  Israel's operation will lead to inevitable collateral damage in the form of civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure.  Whether Hamas is responsible for bringing about the collateral damage by using civilian facilities for operations is immaterial.  What matters is only what the people of Gaza believe, and Hamas is more than capable of controlling the narrative sufficiently to advance their agenda of expanding sympathy for themselves and antipathy for Israel.  Every casualty creates a fallout in the form of radicalization of friends, family, and spectators of the event, and that fallout is what Hamas counts on to generate new support.\n\nIn summary, the Israeli military operation, regardless of whether it is justified or moral, will do very little in the long term to hamper Hamas' ability to stage attacks, but it will create droves of radicalized residents of Gaza which will ultimately strengthen Hamas and decrease Israeli security.\n\nChange my view.",

  "selftext": "For context, I live on the first floor of an apartment complex, as in my front door opens directly outside. The area is hilly so some walls of the apartment are actually underground, making me prime territory for pests to target. All food has always been sealed and out of reach, and we keep the place pretty clean.\n\nMany months ago, my roommate and I found our first mouse. The first instinct was to set out non-kill traps and place cayenne pepper (among other household products which are claimed to repel mice) around entrances. These non-kill traps are still out to this day and they have never caught a single thing. (The same was true back in college when I tried to use a non-kill trap to catch a mouse in my dorm.) The bugger(s) tormented us for months, startling us, leaving droppings, even keeping us up late at night trying to trap them after they made their way into a bedroom.\n\nNext, we tried snap traps, which never worked a single time. The mice would eat the food directly off of them and disappear again. I have an allergy to both cats and peanut butter, so getting a “mouser” and things like the “bucket method” were out of the question as well.\n\nFinally, we moved to the last resort of glue traps, despite seeing all over the internet that some people consider them inhumane. The result? We’ve caught something like nine mice to date and I’ve never seen one running around free. Placed along baseboards and in front of entrances, the glue traps seem to catch every mouse that dares enter my home.\n\nEvery so often, a mouse gets caught on a glue trap overnight, I wake up in the morning a few hours later to see it, and the trap and mouse both get placed into a plastic grocery bag. Then we take it outside and use a large rock (ooga booga) to flatten it, making sure to crush the cranium in one blow so it’s an instantaneous death.\n\nI understand there is probably some distress, and in some instances even pain, for the few hours between getting caught and getting smushed, but the death is quick and painless. Based on my experience with every other method’s ineffectiveness, it seems like the choice is between this or simply living with a mouse infestation.\n\nI could change my view if someone convincingly proves that there is a better method of dealing with mice, that there’s no tradeoff whereby any level of rodent distress is tolerable, that living with mice is acceptable, or something else I haven’t even thought of!",

  "selftext": "Most people I talk with agree that wealth inequality is a major issue in America. However, they often push back against the idea of capping or limiting someone's wealth. I don't understand why. Here's what I propose as to help close the wealth gap: \n\nLimit an individual's net worth to something like 2 billion dollars. I'm not dead set on that number, but I figure it's ridiculously high enough for most people to not be affected, and also high enough that the person could live the rest of their life without working if they wanted to. \n\nNet worth will be calculated/reported during tax season or something like that. If someone is found to have a net worth above the limit, they will be given a time frame where they must sell off some of their property/stocks/whatever, or pay significant fees (I mean like potentially a billions of dollars, based on how over they are) to the federal government, which will be funneled toward development/infrastructure/education in low income areas. \n\nThis law will only affect maybe 2% of the population. It may take significant ground work to set up, but I think it would help drastically, and pay for itself in the long run. \n\nSome common arguments against this: \n\n1. Capping wealth limits growth and development. My response: this will be minimal. There are plenty of people out there doing good work to grow the fields of science and technology, who aren't making billions off their work. Humans will continue to do this even if we limit how much wealth they can make. Things might go a bit slower, but we will also develop in healthier ways (not working crazy hours, valuing other things than production for the sake of survival, etc.) \n\n2. The top 1% will find ways to evade the new law. My response: yes, but not completely. There will always be flaws in any system designed to mitigate corporate greed. People will find ways around it. But if even a percentage of these people's wealth gets distributed, that is a drastic improvement from what we have now. This will not close the wealth gap, but it will certainly help. \n\nNow, of course my idea is fairly vague. I'm not an economist or a tax expert or anything. But if people who are competent in this field make a comprehensive set of laws and regulations based on this premise, I don't see how it wouldn't help lower the wealth gap in America.\n\n\nEdit for my view changing: I can see now that because both international interference and the craziness of the stock market, my idea would not be viable.",

  "selftext": "First and foremost, I am personally a \"live and let live\" person; and it's not even because of political reasons. I believe I am just generally an easy going person as many of my friends and family have told me and noticed about me throughout the years. That's just who I am. Frankly, I do not give a damn whether someone identifies as the opposite gender or even another animal/object. More power to them. Let them live the lives they choose for themselves.  I just want to get this out there, because I am fully aware that I am providing my fellow Redittors with a very hot take here as it can be read from this post's title.\n\nSo, I've already made the case that I don't have a problem with trans people themselves. However, what I have sort of a beef with is that there are a number of trans activists, especially if they're trans who identify as women, who tend to take the higher moral ground when it comes to women's issues and rights. Unfortunately, as a guy who have personally heard and tried to understand the very real everyday struggles that biological women go through, I just cannot bring myself to let their attempts at claiming a moral ground slide through my logical and moral rationale.\n\nMy mother, my girlfriend, my aunts, and my many cousins have told me various stories about having to go through the excruciating pains of menstruation, pregnancy, and female-exclusive viral/bacterial diseases. As a guy myself, I know that I cannot possibly truly understand how it feels because I don't have this sort of biological mechanism myself. Dealing with all these female sex exclusive issues, from what I've heard many times, takes a lot of grit and a lot of intelligence when it comes to planning when your possible cramps and periods will occur during social situations(at work, school, parties, and hangouts). The social stakes are quite high for them actually.\n\nSo, you see, this is why I cannot really take a trans woman seriously when she says she claims a \"first hand experience\" when it comes to women's issues. Perhaps, if trans activists were more cognizant if this dilemma, maybe their movement would gain more legitimacy and rapport.\n\nAlso, the recent controversy surrounding trans athletes, I believe, is just adding fuel to the fire to people's concerns. I don't believe female athletes should have to enter an athletic environment that is unfair. The reality is that trans women who have transitioned  well into their male phase puberty still have their bone density, structure, and lung capacities maintained, despite their new levels of estrogen in their bodies. It's not fair for the biological female athletes, and it's also not fair for sports enthusiasts either; because the thing about competitive sports is that it profits from one thing: \"unpredictability\". Having one athlete who appears to have the upper hand in experience and biology will make a tournament or game all too much predictable for viewers and for the sports bets industry.\n\nAnd so, these are the kinds of discussions that we all must be having to truly ensure that everyone just gets treated fairly at a societal level.\n\nI'm open to any kind of additional insight to this discussion, or perhaps, a counterpoint to my rationale itself, regarding the unintentional invalidation of women's issues due to the excesses of trans activism.",

  "selftext": "“Personhood” is a fluid concept. Personhood can therefore be argued in favor of life or argued away based on whatever subjective definitions are attributed to the concept.

A human can be “alive” but not living “a life” which for the sake of argument means self determination based on self perceived notions of “personhood”. Still, terminating a human life based on a subjective understanding of a lack of personhood is my opinion unethical. We don’t know if it’s a person or not. \n\nArguing in favor of abortion by claiming the absence of personhood is a non starter because outside of philosophical notions the personhood can’t be quantified. \n\nIt is evident however that personhood does exist in our culture and we all act like it does.  But when life begins is not subject to debate since life begins at conception. \n\nIdeas like “having a brain” or “consciousness”does not prove or disprove personhood since the idea of personhood only relies on reasoning not scientific facts.

  "selftext": "Since I've been on reddit I've seen so many posts about young men struggling to date and how male loneliness is this increasing problem. What surprised me the most is that most men seem to think that they have to adopt this grifter persona or lose all hope at dating women. As a woman in my early 20's, surrounded by friends also in their early 20's, I do not know a single woman trying to date a man like Andrew Tate. The biggest complaint that all of us share is that men by and large are gross and don't  know how to take care of themselves and their home on a basic level.\n\nBy take care of themselves I mean:\n\n* Shower thoroughly and regularly (with soap and shampoo *and* conditioner)\n* Have some form of skin care and facial hair care\n* Keep their house clean (not having pee on the bathroom floor, washing the toilet, no mold in the shower, no dishes piling up, sweeping the floor so I don't feel a bunch of shit on my feet, having clean sheets, maybe dusting once a year)\n* Having basic home amenities for themselves and their guests (having sheets on the bed to begin with, having a bed frame, having a hand towel, or even hand soap so I don't have to touch the soap bar that they used on their balls, having places for guests to sit that aren't the bed or covered in junk)\n* Knowing how to cook actual meals so that they can feed themselves\n* Investing in themselves so that they feel confident mind and body (getting clothes that fit and are flattering, investing in hobbies or self care)\n\nFrom the straight women I've talked to it is so rare to find a man that can do these things on his own. It is such a green flag. All of these things will make women feel more comfortable, and some of them are just down right sexy. It also indicates that you would be able to be an equal partner in a relationship, rather than relying on women to maintain your house for you. I also think that when you take care of yourself you show your brain that you're worth taking care of which builds confidence and is attractive on its own. Modern women might put up with a lack of hygiene if they're especially attracted to a man or just want sex, but usually for more of a short term kind of thing.What do you think reddit? Are there men out there that are at the peak of having their shit together and still get rejected by women left and right? Are there incels out there that have tried this with no success?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdits for the comments so far:\n\nWhile I understand that most women do not go to a man's house before they make an initial rejection, I think that the way a man takes care of himself and his home comes off in the way he presents himself and affects his confidence. \n\nI was thinking in terms of building longer term relationships, because these are what actually make people less lonely as opposed to hookups or matches. \n\nA lot of these things do cost money and aren't accessible to many people. The world is not fair and not having money means people are at a disadvantage in almost all aspects of life. This is not unique to men however and that doesn't change the fact that hygiene is sexy and does increase a person's desirability\n\nI am not saying that this is an end all be all list for self care. I'm also not saying that these are the only things that matter in relationships or even that they are the most important things. Nor am I saying that a man who takes care of himself will never face rejection or that every woman will want him. I do think that a lot of young men lack these things and that doing them will greatly increase a man's odds in A. getting a date and B. turning an initial interaction into a long term relationship\n\nEdit 2: I’m adding a point to my argument. If men as a whole made a better impression on the self care front, then there would be less risk for women in giving other men a chance. The less gross shit we think we’re likely to encounter, the more likely we will be to give someone a chance when they first talk to us",

Will they learn to cower, to aøologise for their existence, or perhaps they'll grow up to resent the society that taught them to feel guilt for something they had no control over? \n\nIn dating, men often hear that we have to make the first move, but we can't be creepy. A compliment can turn into harassment. We're told that consent is key, but only as defined by women. When a drunk guy and a drunk girl *both* decide to sleep with each other, the guy risks being labeled a rapist for taking advantage of a poor drunk girl, but the girl never gets such accusations hurled at her for taking advantage of a poor drunk guy. Why is that? Amy Schumer joked about \"having sex\" with a guy who was so drunk he barely knew where he was, let alone was able to get hard. Nobody cancelled her for that. Then there are stories of women \"taking away\" consent that had been given, *after* doing the deed, ruining a man's reputation in the process. I believe Aziz Ansari is such a man. \n\nI've seen studies that claim most men 30 or younger are single (around 63%), and nearly one in three men are sexless (28%). Who's there for these men? Who do they talk to? Many men don't have friends to talk to. Many men are invisible in society and are made to feel that their feelings and problems are a burden on others, so they don't open up. Not only that, but when they do open up, sometimes their vulnerablities get used against them in the next argument or they suffer a break-up or divorce over it. \n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "First I want to define ownership. To own something is to be able to defend it from being taken by another. Newborn animals/humans are not capable of owning anything, including themselves, therefore they are owned by whoever is capable of defending them. Now let's solidify the context of defending oneself to only encompass food/water/shelter. \n\nHumans require food, water, air and shelter to survive. Once a child is of age that is capable of building shelter and growing crops/raising animals, they are then capable of owning themselves. To do this requires land, shelter building materials/tools and time to raise animals/crops.\n\nIn today's society land/shelter/food is only acquired with money. Money is primarily acquired through selling your labor. Until you have enough money to own your own land/shelter/food, you are by definition owned. This is the debt I speak of. We are born into debt and must provide labor until we pay off this debt. Essentially from ages 0-18 we are owned by our parents and until we pay off a mortgage, we are owned by the bank/employer. We cannot choose any other way of living, we are forced into this at birth unless our parents provide us with free shelter of our own, as living with parents is still to be owned by them as it's their home, their rules and can evict you anytime. \n\nYes, I know owning a home comes with property tax which can cause eviction if not paid, meaning we are owned by the government, unless you manage to get tax-except. \n\nIn summary, we are born into indebted servitude, where we are forced to labor for the economy at whatever value the economy determines we are worth until a home is paid off, which is not guaranteed to ever occur within a lifetime. This world is founded upon indebted servitude and progresses upon it. Instead of being assigned a servant owner, we get to choose who owns us as landlords/employers. Those humans of low economic value dont have much choice in employment where as higher value ones can choose employers that treat them well. The only close to free humans on earth are those who own paid off homes and truly free if tax exempt. Change my view reddit.",

  "selftext": "So, we all know about how people say \"go woke, go broke\" in relation to a string of bad writing that we received in works of Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and etc. I hope that people are familiar with the concept because I don't think I have the strength to lay this concept down here (and it also would take a lot)   \nMy issue with the idea, however, is that it does not check out at all: if you say \"Oh, this character is bad is their personality could be boiled down to just being gay/black/etc., and that is bad\", your issue is not with \"wokeness\", but with bad writing. By hyper fixating so much on the idea of \"woke\", you do what you accuse the creative work of doing in the first place. \"Wokeness\" can only be a problem if you think that \"wokeness\" itself, if you wish, is fundamentally bad for writing - that would imply that you just want less gay/black/etc. characters in your work. I imagine that most people will say no, and that they just want \"well-written characters\", but that goes back to my point - the issue at hand is writing then, not this whole woke thing.   \nWhat bugs me the most is that queer folk had, like, the word for it for ages: queerbaiting. Or, you know, racebaiting for racial things. Point being, this concept of \"wokeness\" that people of, usually, more conservative nature tend to use is not even new, the phenomenon had a word for a long time: the issue that I have, however, is that the term queerbaiting implies fault on the side of the work (as in, they wrote a gay/otherwise character simply to pull in those good karma points) while the concept of woke implies that those \"woke things\" are fundamentally bad. The argument as a whole is flaud, and is just another example of far-right idealogy sneaking its way into a liberal mindset.   \nLong story short, the term woke, even if it had a meaning before, is now a complete memetic virus and needs to be scrubbed from our terminology. As far as I am concerned, anyone who uses the word woke unironically is either disingenuous, bigoted, or just not smart. ",

  "selftext": "Chennai Express should have had actual South-Indian actors in them. \n\nMy 1st reason for believing so is that, as someone who knows a lot of South-Indians, they believe that actors like Deepika Padukone did not accurately act like a Tamilian, instead acting more like a Malayali, even though she is from Bengaluru. They even say that Komban and Vidhamba were primarily based on stereotypes of South-India from North-Indians who do not know about the 5 states of Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Telengana, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. They even said that many people know Hindi in cities like Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram, Hyderabad, etc. These problems could have been solved if more prominent South-Indian actors like Thalaivar Rajinikanth, Vijay Thalapathy, etc. They would have been able to do the needful to not let Chennai Express be racist towards South-Indians.\n\nMy 2nd reason for believing so is that it could have been a movie that focused on diversity. It could have cast famous South-Indian actors that would otherwise not have been familiar to the North-Indian audience, such as Vijay Thalapathy, Dhanush, etc. Imagine the beauty of the 2 styles of acting contrasting each other! That would be something new and original for both Bollywood and South-Indian cinema, and since it has such a star-studded cast, it would not be able to flop at all! It would have represented people from all over India properly; instead of only basing Komban and Vidhamba off of racial stereotypes! This would even make South-Indians more interested in Bollywood, and vice versa, bridging the gap between North-India and South-India!\n\nMy 3rd reason is that the movie would have been a huge-hit all over India. Imagine how much money a movie with Shahrukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Thalaivar Rajinilanth, and Vijay Thalapathy would have brougt to the box-office. This would inspire other Bollywood and South-Indian directors to do the same, and eventually bridge the gap between North-India and South-India, making the country a better place. Even then, the popularity of both Shahrukh Khan and Thalaivar Rajinikanth would be more than ever. Shahrukh Khan would have participated in more Tamil films due to his extensive knowledge of Tamil, which is shown in Om Shanti Om, and Thalaivar Rajinikanth would have returned to Bollywood with other South-Indian actors that would have brought discipline and hard-work to Bollywood, similar to their own industries.\n\nThis is why I believe Chennai Express should have had South-Indian actors.",

The United States?\"Don’t get me wrong. I love the U.S., at times – but that ain’t the world. That is not the world. We are the world. We have almost every country out here fighting, thriving, putting on their flag to show that they are represented. There ain't no flags in the NBA.\"\n\nAfterwards, a slew of NBA stars took to social media to respond in disagreement.\n\nLyles's comments are misguided.\n\nIn my view:\n\n\\- The Denver Nuggets are the champions of the 2023 NBA season.\n\n\\- It is undisputed in the sports world that the NBA is a league comprised of all the best basketball players in the world, not just Americans.  In fact, the two best players on the Denver Nuggets are a Serb and a Canadian.  The NBA is \\*the\\* premier destination for top basketball talent from everywhere around the globe.  No matter whether a rare basketball talent arises in Africa, or Europe, Asia, or the Americas, the NBA happens to be where the best players all compete.\n\nAs such, the NBA truly has become a global league and serves as a \\*de facto\\* world organization for the top basketball talent around the world.  Other \"actual\" global organizations like FIBA that hold tournaments cannot hold a candle to the level of global prestige nor top international talent found in the NBA playoffs.\n\n\\- Pointing any of this out is NOT American exceptionalism nor arrogance.  Allow me to state clearly: *my argument is NOT that the best players in the world are American*.  I happen to think that the most valuable basketball player in the world right now is a Serbian national named Nikola Jokic.  (Though others would argue that it's Cameroon-born Joel Embiid).  Either way, I think my point here highlights that this is NOT an America-first opinion.  I would say the *exact* same thing if the NBA happened to be located in Europe or Saudi Arabia.\n\nYes, it is true that the NBA is an organization that was founded in the U.S., whose franchises are mostly located in the U.S. (exception, Toronto), whose owners (or ownership groups) are mostly U.S. nationals.  But I don't think this should matter in the context of crowning a \"world champion\".\n\nImagine that the NBA changed its name to the \"World Basketball Association\" and moved 20 of its franchises overseas.  Imagine that next year, the Nuggets franchise repeats its run through the season, emerges as champs, but, instead, play their home games in Prague and play games against the Rome Bulls, the London Celtics (wink), etc.  NOTHING ELSE CHANGES.  Same rosters, same draft process selecting from all over the world. Only difference is where the home games are played.\n\nNOW would the winner of such a \"world league\" be allowed to call itself the \"world champion\"?  Does where a team play its home games really matter?  Or isn't it more important to consider where the talent pool for the team/league comes from (only in the U.S. vs. all around the world).\n\nI've seen people argue that, no, they \\*still\\* could not call themselves \"world champions\", since - they claim - only national teams can claim to be world champions.  To which I respond - \"Why\"?  Why can't a privately owned club team be dubbed the \"world champion\" when they compete against the best players in the world and emerge triumphant? What's so special about national teams?\n\nAgain, there currently is no other basketball tournament in the world that matches the level of play and raw talent seen in the NBA Playoffs.  That talent comes from around the world. The winner of that tournament deserves every right to call itself the \"champion of the world\" in the sport of basketball.",

There is no way that all this power will just stay hidden for ever. Maybe even a technical flaw will cause a nuclear bomb to go off, and that is how that starts it all\n\nEdit: many people are arguing over if the threat of nuclear war is or is not by definition a chekhov's gun, while my main issue that im arguing is that nuclear war is more of when problem then will it happen problem",

  "title": "CMV: Free college in the US would be a disaster without significant additional legislation",
  "selftext": "To start off, I will say that I 100 percent agree with the idea of college being affordable (or even free) for everyone.\n\nWhat I think is a bad idea, is leaving all of the various elements of higher education unchanged and then subsidizingtuition. It seems crazy to me to look at how tuition has increased well past inflation, not ask why, and then throw even MORE money to schools.\n\nUniversities have to compete with eachother, and have done so by ([according to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/prestoncooper2/2020/08/31/a-new-study-investigates-why-college-tuition-is-so-expensive/?sh=7e99c48417a0)) overinvesting in amenities and administrative positions. With the relative easy access to student loans, prospective students can \"pay\" for these higher budgets. The normal free-market consequences to this kind of runaway spending don't apply. Still, there is at least SOME consequence of going into massive amounts of debt, meaning there is still SOME competition based on pricing. Removing this by significantly subsidizing college tuition means that there will be no barrier to Universities continuing to bloat their budgets and raise their tuitions. If the average cost rises to 50K, it will still be accessible to students, because only the goverment will feel the increase. While it's easy to say \"well we can just keep raising the tax on billionaires\", it's not that simple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. The Free College for All Act has a hard income limit for subsidized education. This means middle class families will eventually find it impossible to pay for college.\n\nBernie Sanders's plan indicates that you get no subsidies if your household income is above 125K single / 250K married. With the rising costs of all other good and services, that amount of money already isn't that high for a single parent. That number supposedly ties to the consumer pricing index, which is flawed for a number of reasons and is laughably out of touch with current numbers. With tuition raises consistently outpacing inflation, and the CPI only weighting arond 2% of its number towards tuition costs, the proposed legislation will not be able to scale according to the actual AFFORDABILITY of college.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2.The Free College for All Act is dependent on a fixed percentage tax on stock trading. This is both inherently risky and difficult to scale with rising costs\n\nThe text of the Wall Street Speculation Tax does not provide for an automatic increase in taxes. I don't even know if that's something that can really happen. One assumes that this is based on the correlative increase in money moving around the market as other costs (tuition) rise. The problem is that it doesn't account for periods of stagnation or recession. Counting on the stock market growing on as short-term of a basis as this is a really bad idea. Even if you could somehow tie the stock market to a certain guaranteed growth, tuition prices have grown at a considerably larger rate. Not doing anything about the exponential increase means that eventually, you're going to need to raise the rate of the tax. If you're dealing with a Republican congress, you're fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. Vocational training will be shortchanged even more.\n\nRemoving the financial component from colleges will make them more desirable. Many people take vocational paths for financial reasons. Of course, this is the point of free college. You're removing an unfair barrier like finances to make college acceptance based purely on merit. That's all well and good until schools expand their capacities. If, say 15,000 students are elgible for acceptance and can currently afford college, what happens if 30,000 students are now eligible for acceptance and can afford it? Do they make that school 50% harder to get into, or do they PRINT MONEY by expanding their capacity?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. Schools will be harder for low-income students to get into.\n\nTake the above point. Colleges can only increase their supply so much to deal with an explosion in demand due to free college. They will have to become more exclusive. Lower income students have a harder time being competitive with things like test scores, grades, and extracurriculars. Free college does nothing to actually change that. The outcome will likely not be a significant demographic change in college admissions. Eventually, progressive admissions standards will be pushed more aggressively to unpredictable results.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn short, the only way free college will work is with significantly more government oversight into the inner-workings of universities. Tuitions would need to be standardized and set by the government, and increases would need to happen with government approval. University budgets would need to be gone over with a fine-toothed comb. Capacity limits, both university wide and for individual programs, would have to be laid against the availability of JOBS and not left up to the institution. Student amenities would need to make sense, and not be used as a competitive edge for schools. Free college for all is a great idea, but without those caveats it would be a disaster.",

  "selftext": "Pretext: I am a Romanian citizen of Romanian-Hungarian descent and I live in Romania.\n\nI think it is detrimental to both minorities and the majority to allow minorities to have institutions that are exclusively or primarily using their native language.\n\nThey should, however, be allowed to use it as a secondary language and to use it in any other private or public context.\n\nFor a real life example, I will use public schools. Currently in Romania we have schools that explicitly teach only in Hungarian and we also have Hungarian sections in normal schools that only teach in Hungarian. I think they should be taught in Romanian, but they could have extra classes for Hungarian language, literature, history, etc. \n\nReasons:\n1. Minority children that go to such schools often are completely or mostly illiterate in the majority language. Anecdotally, I can say that I know plenty of Hungarian kids(including relatives) that reach the age 18 without the ability to communicate in Romanian. This might mean that they fail their finals(which are at a national level, thus in Romanian) and that their opportunities are severely limited(in terms of education and employment)\n\n2. It contributes to cultural segregation and xenophobia. Again, this is anecdotal, but being part Hungarian myself and coming from a town with a high number of Hungarians, I've noticed Hungarians that are educated outside the Romanian system tend to be a lot more xenophobic and they also tend to be supporting separatist movements(they'd like the Ardeal region of Romania to join Hungary)\n\nConclusion:\nMinorities should be forced to primarily use the majority language in public institutions in order to ensure they are integrated into society.\n\nNotes:\n1. I think they should be able and even encouraged to maintain their culture and language through other means. I don't have children yet, but when I do, I'd like for them to retain our Hungarian culture as well\n\n2. I've written this because I've heard plenty of Romanians complain and say that we shouldn't be helping Ukraine because they started forcing Romanians within Ukraine to have schools in Ukrainian, which they consider to be cultural genocide(I obviously disagree)\n\nUpdates:\n1. I have decided that trying a softer approach by forcing Hungarian schools to at least teach their language and literature classes in Romanian primarily, rather than the whole curriculum, could be a better solution.",

  "selftext": "When I've asked progressives why there hasn't been a progressive president if their platform is as popular as they say and why voters consistently vote for middle of the road Democrats, I've generally heard one response or a slight variation on it: Because the US is an Oligarchy and the deck is stacked so heavily against progressives that it's impossible to overcome the obstacles. As proof, they'll point to various surveys showing that the policies they're pushing have widespread appeal. If the policies are so appealing, what other explanation could there be? \n\nIn my view, there there are other explanations: the other policies progressives are pushing which are not popular and the unfortunate timing of the progressive candidate who shied away from the less popular policies. \n\nProgressives generally support reparations (opposed by most Americans. The majority of black Americans are on board, but only 18% of white Americans are) and Defunding the police (the majority of every racial group opposed.) Those are two major policies. Americans are generally also opposed to CRT and progressives messaging on CRT is mixed at best. (Personally in conversations with progressives I've heard it's only taught in certain college courses, but banning it K-12 is a problem and we should teach kids about implicit bias in K-12- implicit bias being a core tenant of CRT. It's enough to confuse anybody.) Progressives are also more in favor of making \"hate speech\" illegal (majority oppose.) \n\nSo given all of the policies progressives push for that are deeply *unpopular* it seems to me like \"the US is an oligarchy and elections are rigged that's why we don't win\" is shifting the blame, not speaking truth. \n\nThere was a progressive who I voted for who did not support most of the unpopular progressive policies. Bernie Sanders. The problem in my eyes is that he ran in the 2016 election, when Democrats were terrified of the Republican candidate. So Democrats threw their support behind the mainstream stereotypical politician (in every way except gender) who ultimately lost. And I think as long as there's the possibility of Trump getting elected Dems will continue to choose the safer, less radical option even if there's a progressive who pushes for the popular progressive policies and not the unpopular ones (which seems to be rare nowadays.) \n\nI do believe money can help candidates big time with advertising, but I also don't think advertisements are so powerful that they can actually make people do things, essentially robbing them of their will. In Oligarchies like Russia, Oligarchs can interfere with ballot counting and ballot tallies and final results. As far as anybody knows, the very wealthy here do not have that sort of power. And with social media it's possible to get a message out to millions with no money and, if the message is popular enough, win the election. \n\nBut in my view bad timing and unpopular policies have prevented this from happening. But I'm of course open to changing it!",

It's simple. Because the data showed that the epidemic was disproportionately impacting gay men, IV drug users, and Haitian immigrants.

According to the **Arab league** Arab Countries are: -\n\n1. **Egypt** (My country)\n2. Saudi Arabia \n3. Yemen \n4. Oman \n5. UAE\n6. Bahrain \n7. Qatar \n8. Kuwait \n9. Iraq\n10. Syria \n11.

Comoros\n\nAnd this is one of the biggest lies that I've ever been told. Because historically most of these countries are **conquered by Arabs** and they united the languages of all these countries and made the Arabic is the official language to all these countries.\n\n# And classifying these countries and classifying us (Egyptians) as Arabs is so as ridiculous as classifying Niger and Cameroon as European nations because they speak the same European language (French).\n\nAnd even countries like **Somalia**, Comoros, Mauritania and **Djibouti** most of its population **don't speak Arabic**. So I don't know why it's considered \"*an Arab State*\"\n\nGenetically and historically *Arabs are the descendants of Arab tribes in the Arabian Peninsula*, which are the countries 2 - 8 (Yemen & Gulf states). And what is more interesting about this fact even **genetically we are not Arabs.** \n\nThe **National Geographic Genographic Project (NGGP)** conducted a *genetic analysis* all across Egypt and they discovered that only 17 percent of Egyptians are Arabs, while **68 percent of the indigenous population** is from North Africa, four percent are from Jewish ancestry, three percent are of East African origins, another three percent from Asia Minor and three percent are South European.\r  \n\r\n\n[https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/](https://egyptindependent.com/dna-analysis-proves-egyptians-are-not-arabs/) \n\n# And another article in the Gurdian said that Studies on modern Egyptian DNA support the view that neither Egyptian Muslims nor Copts are Arab. All the invasions that Egypt has experienced over millennia, including the Arab invasion, do not seem to account for more than 15% of modern Egyptians' ancestry. Which said that about 85% of Egyptians are descendants of the indigenous Ancient Egyptians.\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/egyptian-arab-cultural-identity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jul/08/egyptian-arab-cultural-identity) \n\nAnd I think these studies are different due to the difference in samples of the population of Egypt. Because **Egypt is a multiethnic country**. It has *Arabs in the western desert and Sinai, Amazigh in the Western Desert, and Nubians in the south, and the vast majority of the population is Egyptians in the Nile banks.* Which is very very very interesting! Because ancient **Egyptians inhabited the Delta and the valley thousands of years ago and still doing this in todays life.** \n\nAnd I'm 100% sure that if they take a DNA analysis of Egyptians in the Delta and the valley the **match ratio will increase to more than 90%.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# And even we use some words in the Egyptian Arabic dialect that is rooted to the ancient Coptic language. E.g.: (ست) pronounced as: set, and it means a woman. It's a Coptic word! \n\n(**Miret**) which is a name here in Egypt that means a **beautiful woman.**\n\n# And in terms of food, a common dish here in Egypt we tends to eat it in breakfast -which is fava beans-, it was common also in ancient Egypt. \n\nAnd many other wonderful things like that.\n\n**The same thing applies to most to the \"Arab word\"** \n\n**Moroccans , Algerians and Libyans are Amazigh**\n\n**Sudanese are Kush** \n\n**Palestinians, Lebanese and some of Jordanians are Canaanites** \n\nand so on.\n\n#  In terms of ethnicity, languages is not related to it.\n\n#  In terms of ethnicity, the related things are genes.\n\n# Egyptians are Arabic speakers, but not Arabs.

  "selftext": "I was born in Russia and live in Russia and I always feel angry when I see how American cops straight-up shoot an unarmed suspect or immediately use their guns against someone who's armed with a baseball bat, crowbar, knife or screwdriver. For me, it's just a cowardice and showing of lack of proper training and complete lack of hand-to-hand combat skills of American cops.\n\nMy points and arguments? I want to see American police more competent, having more guts and hand-to-hand combat skills to subdue unarmed or armed with a melee weapons suspects/perpetrators. It would reduce the numbers or using of excessive force or straight-up killings of suspects and perpetrators.\n\n1. US cops should have more advanced hand-to-hand combat techniques and disarming moves. Like, Krav-Maga has it, aikido has moves designed to handle against an armed opponent (especially it it's a knife), combat sambo (used by Russian police) has a disarming moves and moves used to fight against an armed opponent.\n2. De-escalation training. American cops is too rude and too loud with their orders to drop the weapon and surrender, which usually makes perpetrators more angry or provokes a mentally ill perpetrators to attack cops. British and Japanese (and most part of European) cops has way better track record with that, and even Russian police, with all of their issues, has way better de-escalation training than American cops.\n3. Shoot to incapacitate and minimize the damage which cops are inflicted to perpetrator. Yes, I mean \"shoot in the leg/arm\" if it's possible, because it reduces the chance of the death of a criminal. And before you would say \"cops are trained to shoot in center mass, and hitting the leg with a firearm is hard and it's not always incapacitates the perpetrators, and it cam damage a femoral artery and criminal would bleed to death\" - I would refute it. Because shooting the criminal in his/her leg is possible if perpetrator is standing still, but resists arrest or refuse to comply. And shooting in the arm is basically the same, especially in a hostage situation or when criminal uses a human shield. Shoot him in the arm, then bullrush into him using a sheer numbers advantage, take him down and beat the crap outta him until he's incapacitated. Artery? Cops won't left the perpetrator bleeding, because first aid (cops should've be trained in this too) plus ambulance. Russian police has a laws which implies thet they have a DUTY (yes, a duty) to minimize the damage inflicted by them to criminals, which means \"shoot the perpetrators in the limbs, but before - warn them a lot of times that you would shoot and you should make a warning shot, before eventually shooting into the suspect\"). Why American cops has so much disregard to criminals' lives?! Yes, I mean, they are threats, but it doesn't mean cops always should kill them.\n4. More usage of non-letal stuff, such as pepper sprays, tazers or batons. And using guns in less lethal way, such as how it happens in Russia, because Russian cops doesn't have tazers and pepper sprays in their standard armament on consistent level (mostly only on paper, but not de-facto). So, they can only use batons, hand-to-hand combat skills or a gun, but because of the previously mentioned by me law, cops have a duty to minimize the damage inflicted by them to criminals, which means \"shoot the perpetrators in the limbs, but before - warn them a lot of times that you would shoot and you should make a warning shot, before eventually shooting into the suspect\". And surprise! It works! Russian cops rarely kills even armed suspects, because they know how to do that without guns!\n5. Police's whole goal is to ARREST criminals, not KILL them! And no, sorry, I don't buy the bullshit called \"But cops shoots in the center mass to stop the threat, not to kill!\". Yes, they are shooting to kill! Because if I would unload a whole pistol's magazine into a drunkard who refuses to drop the knife and comply - he DAMN would die!!! Instead, why don't use a baton, tazer, pepper spray or outnumber the perpetrator and beat him on the ground until he's incapacitated and doesn't pose a threat anymore? \"Officers are feeling threat for their lives?\". Then what they even do in police?! It's a risky job and you knew it, you cowardly moron! Sorry for my temper, but it really pisses me off... Cops fearing an unarmed teen or drunk guy with a knife or crowbar sounds so pathetic as an excuse to use guns against them... Where's your training in hand-to-hand, de-escalation or non-lethal weapon? In Russia, cops would likely blitz that drunkard with a sheer numbers and beat the crap outta him with their fists and batons, disarming him and handcuffing him after some ground grappling, but American cops would just draw their guns and shoot him dozens of times because SOMETIMES people can withstood a couple of gunshots even while sober (which is not an excuse to unloading a damn whole magazine into a not complying suspect!).\n6. Made the laws stricter because cops in USA has too much rights and can basically kill a suspect and get away with it. In Russia, every case of using a gun by cops is thoroughly prosecuted and if it wasn't justified - a police officer can receive a lot of troubles, including being fired, lowered in his/her rank or even convicted for using an excessive force and abusing the authority.\n\nAlright, I think I said everything, and now I am waiting for criticism and really GOOD arguments to change my mind.",

Why I think religion at its current scale do not have a place in modern society and finally what would most likely change my view.\n\n1. My own personal experience with religion\n\nFirst, my personal experience with religion is not without its ups and downs. I am raised in a non-religious household, but we do our fair share our tradition ceremonies more in the direction of family tradition rather than religious reasonings. I've went to religious camps over the school holidays as well and I found the experience to be fun and enjoyable. However, my disillusionment probably started during high school when I found out science teachers, friends, and authoritive figures not believing in commonly held scientific theories such as evolution and instead subscribing to what the religious teachings taught.\n\nThis is further amplified when I realised and started to take note how toxic and damaging religion is to the lives of the people surrounding me. Friends aren't able to read or watch or enjoy Harry Potter due to religious reasons, country's policy being backwards due to religious reasoning as opposed to humanity, and so on. (E.g. Same sex marriage not allowed on grounds that it is 'immoral' based on religious teachings ; sexist ideology permeating policies as well as family dynamics due to religions teachings)\n\n2. Why I think religion at its current scale do not have a place in modern society\n\nI will first try and clarify what I meant by \"current scale\". What I mean is religion being institutionalize in many region, country and affecting many many policy decision making that impacts the lifes of thousands, if not millions of people world wide as opposed to making decisions based on research, logic, and trials. It is also fully embeded as an identity in many people's lives, for better or for worse.\n\nOrganised religion, as a primary or a contributing factor has caused multiple wars, genocide, segregation and all kinds of atrocities in modern time, some may be on-going, some may be recovering.\n\nMillions of lives are made worse because of religion.\n\nI am not saying it has no benefit. It has true tangible benefit, at its best it provides a supportive community, saves lifes, rehabilitate people and made people's lifes better. However, these support is not without its alternative, and you may even argue that the alternative are better. Take alcoholism for example, religious community could successfully save someone, but a proper rehab with proper guidance as well as a professional may very well work better than religion. In a nut shell, religion at its worse is a 'convenient' excuse to divide humans into arbitary 'us' and 'them' causing conflicts, wars and suffering, at its best, it saves and helps people to find a place of belonging which has its alternative.\n\nI also acknowledge that conflicts could arise from other factors ranging from race, to nationalism, to economy and all kinds of other reason. However, I feel that religion is the one that is the most deadly and toxic because there is no arguing or winning against a holy text that is held as the 'truth'.For example, it probably takes a racist to befriend one or two person of a different race to see how misguided their ideas are. (E.g. [Daryl Davis](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/20/544861933/how-one-man-convinced-200-ku-klux-klan-members-to-give-up-their-robes) befriending hundreds of KKK member and ultimately convincing that their ideology is flawed). On the other hand, how would you convince a religious extremist that they should not do bad stuff for whichever higher power they subscribe to? You are not even arguing against a flawed logic held by the believer, you are now having to argue against a higher power in the form of texts written thousands of years ago. This, in my opinion is also why so many dictators, in the past and present set themselves up as a divine being / 'chosen one' to shut out all dissenter.\n\nTo add on, I think it would be acceptable if religions were at the scale of Astrology or something to that effect, they may have associations, organisations and so on and people that practice it may practice in peace, but they do not hold any major power or say that can influence millions of people to take radical actions.\n\n3. What would it take to change my view?\n\nWhile I did not provide many resources or research as to the objective pros and cons of religion, so I may definitely be biased due to my surrounding and personal beliefs. But I believe examples involving modern conflict arising primarily / secondarily due to religion more than illustrate my point on how it has negatively impacted millions of lives in modern day.\n\nI believe I will change my view about religion's role and justification of its existence in modern society if there were concrete evidence that religion as a whole has benefit ouweighing its drawbacks as well as that there are no alternatives aside for religion to achieve the same benefit.(As an analogy - Opioid is an extremely useful class of drugs to enable life saving procedures and help humanity, and there are no effective alternative, hence its existence is justified despite having caused destruction in many lives caused by substance adddiction; it can also be argued that the benefit outweighs the risk, as well as having the risk being controlled by smart policy and education.)\n\nEDIT 1 : I am not advocating for the removal of religion. That is impossible in our lifetime, and possibly even thousands of years in the future. Religion is here to stay. Nor do I want banning or thought control of people. I am advocating to downscale the strength, influence and scale of religion as a whole. To have less religious influence in policy/ decision making that influence thousands and millions of people. \n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "Needless to say, there have been some incredibly effective campaigns by activists historically. Ranging from universal suffrage, to civil rights to gay rights, people risked life and limb to shift public consciousness with tremendous efficacy. \n\nMany activists today, however, seem to be less concerned with efficacy. \n\n- Police shootings have actively increased since the BLM protests (1)\n\n- More licences have been granted to oil and gas companies since the Just Stop Oil protests (2)\n\n- Isreal is increasing its strikes on Gaza despite free Palestine protests (3)\n\n- The ‘Get Brexit Done’ party won with a landslide in 2019 despite protests to rejoin the EU (4)\n\nThese are just a few examples, to some extent it seems like every movement either achieves nothing, or precedes a societal step in the opposite direction.\n\nI would argue that tactics that include chanting unpopular slogans like ‘defund the police’ and ‘from the river to the sea/intifada’, and antics like throwing paint on art (5) and stopping traffic (including ambulances)(6). Are not as endearing to the wider public as some protestors seem to think…\n\nIn fact they are so wildly unpopular outside of narrow echo chambers, that they actively give carte Blanche to governments and institutions that want to do the opposite. \n\nMany of these same protests fill our TVs a second time, as they are used in promo videos for right wing political parties. Why? Because they inspire such fear and disgust that people will actively vote against them.\n\nUltimately there seems to be a wealth of evidence that activism today does more harm than good. And far more effort needs to be placed on winning people over, than on antagonising them for the sake of social/news media coverage. Not all publicity = good publicity.

I mean, what other economic system would allow so few people to have such power over a whole production for so much money, knowing it may or may not be successful? As another example, look at Ari Aster's Beau is Afraid. This was the director's pet project but lost $35 million. It has a small audience of folks who love it, but not enough of one to warrant how much was spent on it.\n\nCapitalism is the only reason pet projects such as Scorsese's or Aster's can be made.

  "selftext": "So I've been watching the discussion around the repatriation of artifacts to various tribes, various countries that were once colonies or subjects of various world empires, etc and the way its shifted from a more reasonable stance of \"If the country of origin has this nice shiny museum they want to house this in, it should be returned\" to this less reasonable stance of \"we should return any object that is of even the most vaguely questionable nature, even if it means the object will be destroyed\".\n\nOne statement I particularly found disturbing was a recently appointed Director of the Illinois State Museum saying that \"at a certain point you have to stop looking for new answer \\[from ancient remains\\] because they just lead to more questions\"... IMO that person should never be allowed near any scientific institution. The search for answers is literally the entire point of science and archaeology. That thought process is the equivalent of saying you are a scientific sabotuer. They are choosing the fact that a small group of people, whom in all likely hood aren't even the direct descendants of the human remains/artifact makers in question (and in many cases, are probably descended from the people who conquered them and occupied the geographical area in which they existed) are upset and giving that priority over the advancement of human knowledge. In many cases they are returning these remains to meet reburial (which will cause massive damage to them when we inevitably dig them back up in a hundred years after the obsolete concept of religion becomes extinct and we become a mono-cultural global civilization) and the objects, most of which are greatly fragile, to be handled by unqualified individuals and stored in locations that may not have adequate climate controls or access controls to protect those artifacts (which ironically might land them back into the looted artifact system via theft). Another example of religion being allowed to harm science was when they returned a lock of hair from a famous Native American war chief and the tribe immediately burned it, robbing HUMANITY of an artifact forever.\n\n The way I see it individual groups don't have rights over their artifacts, they belong to the collective history of the human civilization. The obvious long term result of human globalized society is that in the long run we become mono cultural, mono racial (as people of different races continue to have children, and this occurs at a higher rate due to lessened geographical concerns), and universally atheist (as the average level of education around the world continues to rise, and treatment for mental illness improves). Thus it makes sense to keep these in places where they are safe, and correctly handled. That's why I don't oppose ALL repatriations, like the situation with the parthanon marbles seems pretty thoroughly ridiculous and rooted in a desire to keep these where western tourists can access them. This is despite Greece having already made ample facilities to house these items in a location where they can be contextually enhanced by the setting. I'm sure various Native American groups that have moved past religion and superstition have also done so. I also believe genuine attempts are being made in the middle east and Africa but the instability in those regions makes it very difficult to have faith in those attempts. For example in the early 2000s the largest Buddha statues in the world were destroyed by ISIS militants. You also have items being returned to places that are essentially dictatorships or Narco states (like Mexico) where the government is so throughly corrupt you have to wonder how many artifacts will end up back in the stolen artifact pipeline or in the private mansion of a political elite. For all these places I think its better to hold them in the institutions they are currently in until the situation improves in the proper settings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "If Romney had won in 2012, I believe the following things would have happened:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The Trump phenomenon would be much weaker today, or non-existent. If Romney were the incumbent president in 2016, he'd be a virtual shoo-in to be the Republican nominee (as incumbent presidents usually are.) Trump very likely would not have chosen to run for president in 2016 at all - and if he had done so, he'd be most likely heavily squashed in the Republican primaries and seen as the joke that he was. The damage that Trump has done to America has been massive, but a Romney presidency might have nipped any Trump aspirations in the bud.\n* Even if Trump wanted to run for president anyway, he likely could not have ever won the Republican nomination until 2020, when Romney would be stepping down - and in 2020, the tide would have been in favor of the Democrats, since voters tend to get tired of the party that's holding the White House after eight years and vote in the opposing party. So if Trump were running in 2020, he most likely would lose to the Democratic nominee since the Democrat would the voter-fatigue momentum on their side. What this means, then, is that Trump may very well never be president.\n* Had Romney (or a Democrat, or - really, anyone but Trump) been president in 2020, I believe he would have done a far better job of handling the Covid pandemic than Trump did. Hundreds of thousands of American lives might have been saved, and the economy sustained less damage.\n* Had Romney won in 2012, I believe the Republican Party would never have taken a pro-Russia turn.\n* Romney was known for a very strong anti-Russia stance - in fact, this was one debate clashing issue between him and Obama in 2012, where Obama was actually the somewhat-Russia-friendlier candidate. Had Romney been president, I believe America would have taken a substantially more pro-Ukraine stance and Ukraine would be in a considerably stronger position today - perhaps even strong enough to the point that the February 2022 invasion by Russia would not have happened.\n* Romney represented the old, traditional wing of the Republican Party - the McCain wing, so to speak - which, for all its flaws, was still a lot better than the current berserk-insane Trump wing of the Republicans. If Romney wins in 2012 and again in 2016, then the Republican nominee for president in 2020 may very well be someone like Paul Ryan (the presumed vice president), which would also represent a continuation of the old-school GOP.\n* The reason the Democrats have remained stuck in their old staid ways (such as nominating and re-nominating an octogenarian Biden for president) is because the Trump factor made them afraid of nominating anyone young, bold or new - Democrats have become incredibly risk-averse (\"We can't nominate anyone but an old white man, because only an old white man like Biden can beat an old white man like Trump!\") If Romney had won in 2012, I think we might have seen a new wave of young Democrats being presidential candidates instead. The 2020-2024 Democratic presidential nominees might be people like Kamala, Buttigieg, etc. instead of.....an 80-year old guy. Without Trump, I think we would see a younger, fresher Democratic party.\n\n&#x200B;",

Service will drop because employees aren't as motivated to keep customers happy during the busy times.  Employees will be less happy because when they're making a flat wage during a crazy shift they'll just be wishing for all that time they get paid the same with less work; most of these service employees love those crazy shifts because they will go 110% for a few hours and rake in 10x the income as the slow hours.\n\nChange my view...",

  "title": "CMV: Firearm Purchases should incur a 60 day waiting period",
  "selftext": "I’m a gun owner in the US, and it is clear to me that there is one small measure that could prevent a large number of shootings that the country experiences. A simple waiting period. In the wake of the Louisville shooting, we see yet again an instance where an individual who decided to commit an atrocity was legally allowed to purchase their weapon of choice (AR15) and within days of the shooting. In this case, the shooter was let go from their job and made the emotionally and mentally deranged decision to kill. Had this person incurred a waiting period for their firearm, it could have given that person 60 days (as I am suggesting) to consider their actions and hopefully cool down the anger. This obviously is not the total solution to all problems in this case, but helps to prevent quick and irrational decision making that puts guns in the hands of people at their peak rage. I would not mind waiting 60 days for a gun just like I accept that if I wanted a suppressor I may have to wait up to a year for a class 3 permit to be approved. There could also be faster processes for those who believe they are in immediate danger where the local jurisdiction could grant a faster clearance, which is how expedited concealed carry permits work. Please, change my view.",

  "title": "CMV: The Western countries' support of the indiscriminate bombing campaign of Israel in Gaza is making me reconsider my heretofore uncritical support for Ukraine.",
  "selftext": "When Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 I was one of those who ardently supported Ukraine and followed the stories of heroic Ukrainian resistance. I was one of those who argued for all countries to support Ukraine in its righteous defense of its own territory and national patrimony. I viewed Russia, and still do, as an imperialist Mafia-like state bent on recreating the Soviet Union through genocidal means. \n\nI cheered the West for supporting Ukraine unreservedly, both morally and materially. I was glad that my own country (the Philippines) spoke out against Russia's aggression and cut off the helicopter deal with the Russians that was done under Rodrigo Duterte's term. I was ready to suffer the high inflation that came about because of the war, because I would rather that Russia not have the upper hand in this conflict. (Even a small inflation rate increase hits Philippine citizens hard.) I followed several Ukrainian content creators and commiserated with their plight. After all, the Philippines experienced such a genocidal invasion by Japan in World War II. \n\nFast-forward to Oct. 7, 2023, the day when Hamas attacked Israel. Like many people, I also spoke out against Hamas' actions and condemned their genocidal attack. I also expressed my support for Israel's  desire to secure each hostage taken by Hamas, even though I do not respect Netanyahu and his Duterte-like government. I, however, disagreed that Israel needed to bomb Gaza from the air. I hoped that the Israeli government and the IDF would decide on combined-arms operations that did not include aerial bombings as well as espionage inside Gaza.\n\nI was taken aback by many Ukrainians uncritically supporting Israel. The same people who I believed were heroic in defending their country from imperial aggression, who were victimized by Russian bombings of residential areas in cities such as Kharkiv and Kyiv, were now lending support to the bombing of residential areas in Gaza. And they would give some justification for it, like Hamas emplacing rocket launchers in residential areas and similar talking points employed by Israeli right-wingers. \n\nAlso, I was shocked to see many Westerners who have Ukraine flags on their bios and socials applauding the bombings and supporting Israel's collective punishment operation uncritically. These people would gaslight critics of Israel and ask if they \"supported Hamas\" when any support of Hamas was obviously off the table, for moral reasons. \n\nAt this point, I feel betrayed and duped into thinking that the vast majority of Ukraine supporters online and in tri-media support Ukraine on moral grounds, when they offer uncritical support for the Israeli bombing campaign (and not just the imperative of rescuing the hostages). People saying \"It's unfortunate collateral damage\" and leaving it at that, without calling for a less murderous option. It's clear to me that there is a kind of moral hypocrisy they employ here, just because Israel is geopolitically aligned with the West and Hamas (not Palestine) is an Iran stooge, Iran having participated indirectly in the invasion of Ukraine (i.e. on the Russian side).\n\nTherefore, I've decided to stop actively voicing my support for Ukraine's counteroffensives. I still believe that Ukraine is right to defend its territory and people from Russian aggression, but I'm throwing my hands up and becoming a noncommittal spectator. My actual position is that Ukrainians and Palestinians both deserve freedom from imperial aggression by Russia and Israel respectively, they certainly don't deserve to be bombed from the air just because the aggressor thinks they have the power to exact collective punishment. There's definitely some room left for elaboration there, so you may help me to clarify it in the comments. Thanks!    \n\nUPDATE: as of 14:35 (UTC+8) of 11/20, the following has been achieved:\n\n1) This post got a lot of downvotes and comments talking down to me, grossly misrepresenting my position, insisting on their preferred definition of \"ceasefire\" and \"aggressor\", and essentially painting me, a person they haven't met, as the bad guy.\n\n2) We also got a bunch of what I have observed were \"thought-terminating phrases\", such as:\n\na) Hamas uses people as human shields;\n\nb) Hamas is Palestine;\n\nc) Ukraine is Israel;\n\nd) Palestine is Russia;\n\ne) Legality is downstream of morality;\n\nf) It's expensive to go in, so IDF bombing the area is more moral\n\nI agreed with phrases a) and e) but continued to try pushing the conversation around these, and I offered pushback for f). \n\n3) In the replies I was actually advocating for the Armed Forces of Ukraine and their methods. Not that I am forced to: I am glad to point this out for supporters of Israel's bombing campaign, and this is a belief I sincerely hold. I am seriously considering if I should give deltas to certain people who I have talked with in this way, as the core of my thesis is that I am going to stay silent about my pro-Ukraine position. Not all, definitely, lest they think I have changed my mind toward their view.\n\n4) Someone did change my mind a little bit. Their sense is that support for Ukraine is a (very) low moral bar which everyone can clearly get on board with, and they do for various reasons. So why expect the same situation for a small, particularly heinous segment of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, to which people have been preconditioned to pick a certain side through their media diets? Because of this, I take their advice and definitely will not be expecting pro-Ukraine people to argue in the same moral spirit for or against any actor in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I now recognize that there is a huge moral stumbling block between the two issues, and many people may not perceive it in the same way I do. That doesn't mean I agree that their moral accounting is correct. Also, that doesn't mean I agree that joining these people when they proclaim their support for Ukraine is a necessary thing to do. I will still think, this person wants Israel to bomb Gazan families, and doubt if I can take their Slava Ukraini seriously. \n\n\n",

The Ukrainian-Russia war:Despite the fact that Russia is able to occupy some territories of Ukraine,the EU,Nato and other neutral countries like sweden,switzerland act together to freeze Russian assets in the west,donate weapons to Ukraine,sanction Russian businesses which make Russia unable to occupy Ukraine and proves the fact that Russia is only strong on the surface and its army cannot compete with the western trained Ukrainian army.\n\n2. Lack of internal social problems in the west:Russia and China are currently suffering from low birth rates,internal debt,shortage of water,corruption,authoritarianism,aging population….. But the west doesn’t have the problems mentioned above and is still growing strongly economically by having Google,Facebook,Youtube,Instagram,Paypal,Microsoft,Mcdonalds but the non western countries have got nothing to compete with other than Tiktok\n\n3.

  "selftext": "Mods, please don't remove this. I am sincere and genuinely want to change my mind. Please don't auto remove, which is what happens in nearly every single subreddit. Backstory: I grew up with Christian parents and realized at a young age when I grew up I wanted to fight for LGBT rights, general progressive beliefs and against all religions. However, I've noticed how only Christianity is criticized, never Islam (or Buddhism).  Which is rather pointless for me who is Norwegian, where Christianity is seen as a joke.\n\nI believe that it is impossible to criticize Islam without risking being accused of racism. I think the response is when a white person is criticizing it boils down to \"That's suspicious that you are criticizing a religion and culture you are not from. Cultures and religions should change naturally without interference via exchange of ideas and empathy. All change must come from the group itself. Why don't instead you look away and focus on the issues in your local area?\" \n\nI think that is completely normal and great to have empathy and care about issues and cultures and people you have never met. Yet this is seen as suspicious. \n\nThis drains me a lot, because I think LGBT rights and progressive beliefs are best enforced from the state. It's great if people change their own minds, but it should not be relied on.\n\nI'm really struggling because I think the socialist left is right about nearly everything else. I want to be a socialist but without moral/cultural relativism and religion and that the state should enforce progressive beliefs.\n\nFor example, I think criticizing pride parades should be considered terrorism, refusing to handshake because of your religion is sexist and that there should be jail time for catcalling. When I try to explain this to other socialists they seem hesitant, which I assume it is because it will hurt low income religious people.\n\nI'm really scared that we in our fear not to offend religion are going to slow down with state interference for progressive beliefs in fear of riots or raising taboo issues. I live in Norway we are so wealthy that these kind of issues are pushed under the rug due to the fear of discussing them, rather than that the state (if left wing) should face it head on via force.\n\nAnd just to make it clear: Only criticizing dictators and authortiarian leaders and nations in the Middle East does not count. I am talking about criticizing working class people and people who have suffered, because it is still not a valid excuse to be homophobic and sexist.\n\nCan someone please CMV? I have tried finding help, some subreddits have instant bans and rules that Islam must be criticized in the context of other religions, which I find confusing. Christianity is dying and becoming a kind of atheism while Judaism does not try to convert others.\n\nPlease help me! **I really want to CMV as I notice all other leftists love religion if it is non-Christian.**\n\nNote that giving vague replies about \"why do you care so much about this issue? Why don't you look in a different direction or care more about your own beliefs, huh?\" will not change my view. Also, this is not an issue a psychologist can help with.",

  "selftext": "EDIT: I’m getting a lot of replies and it’s getting difficult to reply to them all. First of all I’m not arguing against third trimester abortions out of medical reasons of any kind, I’m arguing against third trimester abortions out of convenience. I should have put that in the title. I then disagree with the idea of that “well not many people support that” as a reason to why this cmv is “pointless” because I find it an interesting idea regardless. Same with a cmv that said “there’s no possible reason to believe the earth is flat”. So I’m just simply seeing if there could be a reason to why a 6-9 month abortion out of convenience could be morally or legally okay.\n\nAnd before someone says it this excludes if the mothers life is in danger.\n\nI’m pro choice up to around 20-24 weeks because before that the baby has no consciousness, no sentience, I don’t think it’s a person. \n\nThat’s my cut off line, but many people have their own cut off lines. Pro lifers believe it begins at conception, others would say when the heart starts beating (even though that’s a terrible argument), others would say at 3 months, 6 weeks, etc and then finally you have radical pro choice people who would try to argue that abortions are okay up to the full 9 months.\n\nWhenever I hear people try to argue for abortion up to 9 months, it’s always emotionally charged arguments “my body my choice”, which is a horrible argument and it’s stupid that’s the mainstream argument for being pro choice, reasoning like that is why liberals aren’t taken seriously. Excluding cases of rape of course when you have sex you know you may get pregnant, it is not your body, it is a body within your body. It is not a parasite, it does not harm you. I don’t see “my body my choice” as a good argument for abortion period, and it’s certainly not at 6-9 months. Anyway that’s my rant about “my body my choice”.\n\nI’m mainly just looking for an argument or reason that I can’t think of currently, some sort of reason there could be an inherent difference between a 6-9 month old fetus and it being out of the womb, but I don’t see there being any way to argue for it. Inside of the womb vs outside of the womb is just way too arbitrary. But if anyone has a reason that I can’t think of I’d love to hear it and engage in the discussion!\n\nChange my view.",

  "selftext": "This post is inspired by the recent Alan Colie / Tanner Cook court case but also just applies in general to similar scenarios. For those unfamiliar [Cook is a YouTuber that does shitty prank videos mostly just harassing people. He approached and harassed Colie at a mall and Colie shot him.](https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/jury-divided-over-whether-delivery-driver-who-shot-youtube-prankster-acted-in-self-defense/3432763/)\n\nLet me start by saying I believe Cook in general is a piece of shit and I would struggle to really find sympathy for him. Harassing/Pranking bystanders for youtube content is abhorrent. In most places it's against the law. However, what I'm observing on reddit/social media that I believe to be wrong is the mentality of \"if we don't like someone, if they get shot they deserved it regardless of circumstances.\" \n\nIn an ideal world what would have happened in this situation is Colie would have found or contacted police nearby and they could have cited or arrested Cook for harassing people in a public space. Instead less than 20 seconds into being harassed Colie just pulled a gun and shot Cook. Colie was not facing imminent physical danger. \n\nI grew up believing if you can't get the justice you wish for in the moment for a micro aggression, you can't just shoot the other person. But I'm not sure that is accurate anymore. It's certainly headed in the opposite direction. Normally I'm put off by slippery slope arguments, but I think we are seeing this slippery slope become more and more slippery right in front of our eyes over the past ~20 years. \n\nWhat Cook was doing was annoying. Even if I would rather people like him simply not exist, he still deserves the same legal protections as I do. I think about what would happen if I approached a stranger to ask a question and they simply perceived that I was harassing them and so they shoot me. Or if an innocent unarmed teenager is just walking through a neighborhood and a racist scumbag decides to murder him and gets to walk scot-free. We have observed multiple instances of people in bad faith claiming to \"feel threatened\" just as an excuse to shoot someone.\n\n\nWhat we are seeing play out on the internet in this case and others is a popularity/likeability threshold to determine guilt/innocence. There are dozens+ examples of people doing far worse than what Cook did in this exchange which the vast majority would say doesn't necessitate shooting the other person. The mostly one-sided social media reaction to this story is ignoring the facts of the story because Cook is an unlikable person doing a very annoying thing. \n\n\nI would also point out that social media are forming their judgment/conclusion on this story based on Cook's reputation and history. This is an extreme double standard. We get furious when police try to justify a shooting based on the person's past warrants and behaviors that the police didn't even know at the time. \n\nI know it's easy to see this story and feel Colie had a right to shoot Cook. My concern is that the threshold for random people to decide they are justified to shoot other random people is going in the wrong direction. Using lethal force in a scenario where you or others are not in imminent physical danger is wrong. Even if the person you shoot is a really shitty and annoying person. Even if 90% of the internet thinks the person had it coming.",

  "title": "CMV: Many atheists act with as much \"zealotry\" as the Christians they criticize",
  "selftext": "When I think about Christians I often am left thinking about their stance on punishment.\n\nThey think Hell is okay. That it is a righteous punishment because its given from on high and the people who are there put themselves there.\n\nAn infinite punishment for finite crimes is perfectly permissible, to them. Despite the fact that God neglects us and refuses to teach us where we're wrong and how we're wrong. He simply watches and observes us in our fumbling and stumbling as we stumble our ways into Hell.\n\nThe problem I'm seeing with a lot of modern atheists is that they fail to relinquish themselves of the same exact mindset.\n\nThey yearn for harsh punishments against people despite supposedly also realizing that humans are essentially all stumbling about, sometimes with bad information and misguided belief structures that cause the stumbling to occur.\n\nThey realize this, but there's still a lot of \"Christian\" in them in terms of wanting to harshly punish and scrutinize others for their \"sins\".\n\nEspecially in the case of a religious person, whom they seem to hate on principle of being religious. \n\nI have a contention with this for a good number of reasons, but I'll highlight one particular one.\n\nIf God is real and he is the ultimate good as Christians claim then the Christian's answer to \"how do I be good?\" is to seek God's guidance.\n\nWhich makes logical sense. If you're having trouble figuring something out then seek an expert on the subject who ultimately knows more than you do in order to help teach you and guide you.\n\nOf course God isn't there, an atheist would say. So you could ask him for guidance on how to be good all day long and you'll get nothing, but your own thoughts.\n\nA fatal flaw to trust yourself so wholly in the efforts of being \"good\". Ultimately Christians would have morality that is just as subjective as the rest of us.\n\nAn atheist would argue.\n\nBut then the atheist has relinquished themselves of God in their mind, but remains Christian in their culture. And one of the markers of Christianity seems to be to name, shame, and belittle those who are \"sinful\".\n\nAnd I ask, hang on a minute. If God is real then he would indeed be the ultimate arbiter of goodness. But if it is found that God is not real, then why would you immediately assert yourself to be the only necessary arbiter of goodness? You haven't replaced God with a greater sense of morality for having forgone him, you've simply removed an outside source of scrutiny. \n\nIf God's guidance is non-real and therefore mislead by the faulty minds of the masses, then why are we returning our moral and ethical scrutiny to whatever the masses will? It was the unquestioning march of collective thought that got us into this mess of \"goodness\" to begin with. Why the hell are we listening to the whims of the masses instead of, I don't know, the professors of ethics and criminology and justice who sit around thinking about these kinds of things on very deep levels? Why do we defer it to the masses?\n\nI'll be more direct here.\n\nAtheists seem like they are becoming or have become as harshly critical and demanding of others as the Christians always have been in the past. If you realize that humans are so very fallible *and* you realize that they're likely to be misguided then how we can continue to argue in favor of such harsh treatment towards the people who commit themselves towards sinful behavior? Why do we return to the rituals of public shaming and torturous treatment? The Catholics used to burn people at the stake, we might be too 'civilized' for such treatment these days but we'll happily castrate a man if it makes us feel safer. \n\nWhy?

We are exposed to radiation from natural sources with much smaller wavelengths, and thus with more energy.examples: the ionizing radiation from the Sun that gets through the atmosphere, from elements in the Earth such as Radon\n2. Microwaves and radio waves have less energy than even visible light, so if 5G causes cancer, LOOKING at stuff as sure as hell should\n3. I'm not saying (edit: consumer) tech doesn't have any negative effects, I've experienced it firsthand, but these are headaches .... because I was coding and forgot to turn the lights in the room. Many of the symptoms people say is caused by wireless networks is caused by something else entirely.\n4. The reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is because it , well , ionizes atoms by knocking electrons out of the electrons shells. If 2 atoms in a molecule, for example, a DNA molecule, gain the same charge, then they will 'rip' the atoms apart. That causes a mutation, and enough mutations, you get a cancer cell. So maybe, electronics MIGHT (not likely) cause adverse health effects, but I'm convinced that cancer is not among those.\n\nAre these valid? Tell me down below.",

Please don’t try to convince me that capitalism is some evil system, unless you’re some kind of genius. \n\nAnyways, we live in a capitalist society and that’s a good thing. That’s my initial premise. To survive in such a society you need capital and intelligence. The former is used to invest and generate more capital. The latter is used to invest properly. Most people lack sufficient capital when they’re young to invest. However, the children of rich people are fortunate to have potential access to such ready capital. \n\nYet, many wealthy people who go to good schools squander this opportunity. These people are inherently bad people *solely* because of what position they occupy in a capitalist society. These people have an increased duty to invest their familial wealth into increasing their capital and overall wealth. \n\nI drafted this post after having a conversation with a poor person who went to a prestigious school on a scholarship. He remarked that many of the wealthier students simply spend a lot of their time partying and doing drugs with their parents’ money. My argument is that these individuals, despite their youth, are inherently bad people because they both occupy a significant class of capitalist society, and squander their wealth despite it. \n\nEven if a trust fund kid doesn’t make good investments, as long as they try is what’s important. I’m not saying every rich kid needs to grow up and become a billionaire with a small loan of a million dollars. But they need to recognize their role in our society and be willing to *attempt* to grow their ready capital instead of wasting the money on their own consumption. \n\nTL;DR: rich offspring have a greater duty to not squander their familial wealth because we live in a capitalist society. Rich kids who waste their capital and opportunities by partying are inherently worse people as opposed to impoverished people who do the same thing because they’re wasting substantial capital.",

  "selftext": "I am sure people will come up with a few exceptions, but I am more interested in this as a rule.\n\nLet's start with a small country like Guyana. They have a small economy, largely absent from geopolitics, then they discover large oil reserves. Most people think that is a good thing, their economy is booming, and sure it is, But this is only the short term, already a neighbour is threatening to invade and suddenly the sights of super powers are on the tiny nation and their influence is starting to flow into the country.\n\nSpeaking of the neighbour, I don't think Venezuela is threatening to seriously invade, mostly because I don't think any of Venezuela's problems come from a lack of oil. Venezuela also had an economic boom for while, but it is much further down the timeline than Guyana, and should be a cautionary tale. After the boom that made Venezuela one of the wealthiest nations on the planet, the country got a bad case of Dutch Disease (I would argue any small country that discovers oil is bound to get this because no other aspect of the economy could possibly match the growth of the oil sector), and has been at the mercy of fluctuating oil prices for a long time. Eventually, just as most petro-states do, Venezuela also developed a big corruption issue. Wealth inequality, and entitlement led to the rise of incompetent populist leaders that completely wrecked Venezuela's oil industry, doubled down in the corruption, and have keep the country in a never ending tail-spin and perpetual state of economic collapse and a recurring, ironic energy crisis.  \n\n\nLarge, developed countries and super powers fare better because they have more diversified economies, but are no less prone to corruption due to the unchecked rise of an oligarch class (see Russia). In federal systems, the states or provinces with the oil reserves also develop an outsized sense of entitlement and self-importance against the rest of the country, and special interests start pushing for divisive rhetoric, poisoning politics, and sabotaging education and long-term cultural development due to oil's perverse incentives to contradict scientific consensus. Texas in the U.S. and Alberta in Canada are both good examples of this. Both of these states/provinces pump out populist politicians, push for regressive policies, are prone to misguided separatism, and sabotage their own education to keep workers from critically assessing the need for clean technology and transition. This all results in negative effects for the country at large. Some are obvious extrapolations, like dropping standard of education, wealth inequality, and bad-faith democratic engagements, but also the concentration of power around these sectors shape policies in ways that: allow oligopolies to rise by allowing for poor corporate practices like vertical integration, sabotage efforts to develop proper public transit infrastructure across the country, weaken environmental regulations (which in turn makes other sectors less productive due to more unstable ecosystems and biodiversity loss), and force reliance on other corrupt states.\n\nThen there are secondary effects too. Car-centric cultures for example, that result from poor public transit, become more dependent on oil and redeveloping the infrastructure. This dependence on oil leads to more urban sprawl, more traffic, and more wealth inequality as owning a car becomes a de facto necessary tax to participate in society. As a country becomes more dependent on oil, its interests become more intertwined with that dependence, and populations can't make clear minded decisions regarding geopolitical events such as wars, because they are directly affected by the resulting fluctuating gas prices which in turn results in poor foreign policy incentives for democracies. Ironically, these interests start to appeal to \"energy independence\", when in reality it is mostly corrupt, theocratic, and plutocratic countries that benefit from reliance on oil and get to set its prices, while greener technologies don't provide a profit to the local barons, but are truly accessible by anyone with the proper infrastructure.\n\nIn short, I think we never see past the short term economic gain, but time and time again we see countries fall to the greed brought on by \"black gold\" and it makes everything worse, from inequality, to quality of life, to having a habitable planet.",

  "title": "CMV: The majority of people who think the economy is doing poorly dont understand inflation and the process of getting it under control and instead think they would be better off in a recession",
  "selftext": "A large percentage of people currently believe that Biden is doing terrible on the economy, largely due to inflation and difficulty affording things. I think that is entirely because they do not have an understanding of what inflation actually is and dont realize that this is, in fact, the ideal scenario.\n\nInflation had a peak of 6.5% and is currently down to 4.1%. While still elevated, this is a remarkable improvement and the fact that we are slowly approaching the ideal rate of 2% without entering a recession and having people continued to be employed is remarkable. I think, what people dont understand, is that inflation is cumulative and the numbers will never go back down without major things happening and I would like to use the example of food to illustrate this. There are two things that will cause the price of food to largely return to where it was, either a technological breakthrough that doubles yields (not happening) or, the more likely scenario, a drastic decrease in demand because people are out of work and are no longer able to afford anything because the economy is in a recession. I think this later scenario is what many are naively arguing for!\n\nIn addition, I dont think they really understood the 3 paths that we were facing at that time. The first path was runaway inflation, second path was slowly decreasing the inflation rate to 2%, and the third path was entering into a recession. I think we are currently on this middle path and seem to be doing it really well, but if you look at posts all over reddit, people will say, \"the economy isnt doing great, I can barely afford my rent and groceries when I used to be able to\". I am not saying that isnt true, but they dont realize that that is the goal. Would they rather we have entered into runaway inflation? Would they rather have lost their job and not be able to afford rent at all but at least the rent in their area hasnt increased?\n\nEdit:\n\nA number of people have posted about wages not keeping up. I admittedly should have included that in this post but instead I am just going to copy and paste the comment I made when replying to someone else\n\nWage growth lags inflation and is currently growing faster than inflation. This is kind of the point I am making about not understanding what inflation actually is and how you get it under control. You need consumer spending to go down, the way to do that is not have wage growth outpacing inflation because how would that cause consumers to stop spending so much money? You have to wait until it gets to a reasonable level.[https://www.statista.com/chart/27610/inflation-and-wage-growth-in-the-united-states/](https://www.statista.com/chart/27610/inflation-and-wage-growth-in-the-united-states/)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI just want to add a rebuttal to a point I keep seeing people make, and that is that I didnt talk about where inflation came from. For the purposes of this post (looking at peak inflation to now), that frankly isnt relevant but lets talk about it. A lot of people are blaming it entirely on the stimulus money, and while I am not denying that that didnt have some sort of effect, I also dont think it was the largest cause. I believe that, post covid, demand rocketed to pre-covid and beyond levels in very short time periods, but the supply chains were shut down. Those supply chains took time to get back on-line, and once they did there was a huge backlog to get through. This created a big mismatch of supply and demand, starting an inflationary spiral.\n\nI believe this is the bigger cause as opposed to the stimulus payment, and the reason why is because we can look at the rest of the world. After coming out of covid, literally every single one of our peer countries started to experience rising inflation for the same supply chain reasons. Some did not pass these big stimulus payments, some did, but regardless they all still experienced inflation. I also think that, because of the underlying causes being the main driver of inflation, it would have happened regardless of whether Trump or Biden was president, there was no correcting it. Id also like to point out something else, we are currently the country that is doing the best, out of every one of our peer countries, at coming out of inflation while maintaining a robust economy.",

  "selftext": "So this is something I've thought about for a while, and I do want to have it changed, if I've got it all wrong.\n\nI've encountered many cases of people saying that by buying a certain product you accordingly support the creator(s) of it, financially or otherwise, and as such also support them spreading their morally questionable beliefs/behaviors.\n\nIt's been said for a lot of things, such as buying music from Michael Jackson and R. Kelly, to buying clothing from Nike and food from Nestlé.\n\nMost recently it has been said about buying the Hogwarts Legacy game, which is a game taking place in the fictional universe that J.K Rowling made. Rowling has the last couple of years said some questionable things regarding trans people, and as such people feel that by buying that game you automatically support her beliefs.\n\nAnd that is in spite how those beliefs are not only absent in the game, but actually opposed: there are trans people and gay people in the game, and they are portrayed in a positive light. Could it not also be said you support those people by buying a product that portrays them positively? \n\nWhat about listening to a Michael Jackson song, just to make yourself feel good? Like listening to \"heal the world\" which is about making the world a better place, in opposition to the allegations of child abuse? (for those who believe he partook in that, even though MJ doesn't live anymore to receive financial support). \n\nThere are a lot of very questionable people near the top or at the top of a lot of different big/global corporations out there, including within music, housing, food, banking, gaming, IT, movies, real estate, transport, etc. Would you stop buying products from Disney because of their sweatshops, and tell your  little kid no more watching the little Mermaid? Or not buy those Nike sneakers your little boy has pleaded you about? It's difficult to say what to do.\n\nIt is going to be something of a minefield to avoid paying money to some people/organizations with questionable morals, especially if you haven't researched the corporations you buy from.\n\nNow, obviously some services are more essential for survival than others, and the morals of the people/organizations in question can vary. Like, it's one thing to buy a windows PC from Microsoft, another thing to buy a kitkat from Nestlé. Simultaneously there might also be a difference in how many people are involved with making/spreading the products, such as if it is just a singer releasing an album that you more directly support, versus a global car company where the money changes a lot of hands before landing at the CEO. Certain compromises might be morally justified for specific cases. \n\nMany of us are making compromises on immoral acts on a daily basis that we accept as okay, such as eating animal meat or buying products that have been tested on/made from animals, or buying certain foods because they are cheaper and you don't have enough money to splurge. Certain cases like living in a country that has done a lot of bad things, and continues to do of bad things, is also almost unavoidable. \n\nI understand it can sometimes get a little difficult to determine where and when to draw the line. But regarding Hogwarts Legacy, I feel it isn't that big of an issue.\n\nI feel that buying the Hogwarts Legacy game is an acceptable moral compromise (especially if you openly support lgbtqia, which I do), even if it's creator differs on it (J.K Rowling that is, I don't know what Portkey/Avalanche believes).\n\nOr am I seeing this from a faulty perspective?",

Like sure, maybe logically my ideas are sound (sometimes), but I just don't have that level of empathy and compassion that they do. The level of compassion and empathy that would make it so when I walked by a homeless person living on my street my first reaction was  \"I'm so happy that they are able to camp on my street, but lots more needs to be done they are suffering\" and not \"are they going to ask me for money, are they sane, are they violent.\" And then I would feel actual joy upon seeing them. \n\nAnd I feel like this is an idea the far left has perpetuated- that they are the most caring and compassionate and empathetic. Maybe not the most logical always, but the most emotionally connected to others. And they are able to present all sorts of whacky ideas under the guise that they are superior in this way. And the anger you see when somebody challenges them- well that's natural they are so deeply connected to the suffering person that they feel the pain for the other person. \n\nBut I think, if anything, the far left overall is less compassionate and less empathetic than their more moderate counterparts. Many of them are in their most self centered years (college students namely.) They tend to be more hostile towards opposing ideas. Less able to handle criticism. More willing to act out. Traits that are more closely associated with vulnerable self centered ness, not empathy and compassion. Some of the worst people I've met, people who valued power, were also very far to the left. \n\nMy general view is that the extreme left and extreme right have less compassion and empathy for others, but according to the extreme left people to the right of them have less empathy and compassion than them. \n\nObviously my view concerns groups, not individuals. I think the far left as a group wants to appear more empathetic and compassionate, but I don't think they actually are. But I'm curious to hear others opinions and open to changing my view.\n\nUPDATE: view has not changed\n\nI appreciate the people who are trying to have a discussion. I don't appreciate the people who are implying or outright saying nasty things about me. Everybody's allowed to speak their mind, but I don't think I'll be responding to those comments going forward as I don't think it's productive for anybody.",

The foreign country is giving a discount to consumers and local government is denying it's people of this discount. Competing local companies won't be happy about it, but the extra spending money that local consumers will have from that discount will leave more money to be spent within the economy funded by the foreign country. Imagine Country A and B.\n\nSenario 1\nA: subsidizes steel\nB: thanks for the discount!\n\nPeople have more money to spend in other industries to take advantage of the discount. Locals in steel industry are free to do other productive things. The extra money from the discount creates more jobs for everyone locally.\n\nSenario 2\nA: Subsidizes steel\nB: no no no, tariffs\n\nLocals pay more for steel, discouraging manufacturing of steel products. There's less money for consumers to spend making the economy worse than doing nothing. \n\nThe only reason I think protectionism is so popular is because it's hard to gather enough resources to lobby for the economy as a whole. It's much easier and beneficial for a company to lobby for anti-competitive policy that hurts the economy as a whole, but increases company profits.\n\nLook at the economic success of Switzerland, and Singapore.

And majority rules.\n\nHowever, given it is not illegal in my country and in most countries as far as I'm aware, I see nothing immoral about it.\n\nIf I rent a car out, that's not immoral. If I rent a hotel, that's not immoral. So i fail to see how landlording is immoral. Now the for profit part. Every business profits. Including farmers, even if food is a necessity, profiting off food is not immoral.\n\nWhy would anyone do anything except for profit?\n\nNow the next part. Who builds the house? Builders. Who needs to pay? If not the person wanting the house than the buyer. At some point there is someone that asked for the house to be built. This person either directly paid for the wood etc or they paid someone to do all of that. Either way, they paid. They paid say 10000$ in 1820. Then they sold it for 50k because inflation in 1880.

Like most things on rotten tomatoes, the audience score was high, and the critic score was low. \n\nThe movie first of all isn't masterpiece of storytelling by any means, but some of the things the critics said were out of pocket. Some of them have really sour-toned reviews about random aspects of the film that wouldn't bother the everyday viewer, like how much of the movie relies on Barbra Streisand's voice, presence, acting, etc. I really don't feel like that was a negative aspect to the film at all, she's the star of it for goodness sake. Another one was comparing it's plot to the Sousnd of Music, which is just a very different movie so I don't feel it's a justifiable comparison.\n\nAll of the critic reviews, even the positive ones, felt less insightful than the audience reviews.

In other words, consenting adults in private can still be doing something wrong, and what *makes* the action wrong *cannot be derived from the idea of consenting adults in private*. \n\nNote: this argument is about legal relationships that do not involve employment or education.

[Considering most millionaires are self-made, they deserve to take the backseat and enjoy the fruits of their hard labor](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/26/majority-of-the-worlds-richest-people-are-self-made-says-new-report.html).  If your skills and experiences bring a large amount of value to the company, the more you'll be compensated for in the form of benefits and pay. This is basic economics 101. Hell, this is common sense. As children, in gym class the better players were always picked first and got to make the major calls during the sports games. This concept is universal to the human experience. In economics this reflects in how you're paid and respected. \n\nIf your the average joe in your company or even a low-level laborer, it will reflect in your pay and benefits package (If you even have one, lol!) Why should you feel entitled for more than your share of pie? Hell, if it weren't for First World minimum wage laws you'd get paid even lower considering the lack of value you provide to the company. Just because you do 10 hours+ of backbreaking work doesn't mean you bring value that justifies you being compensated more, considering how easily replaceable you are and the lack of specialized skills you offer. You should be GRATEFUL that you're even getting paid slightly more than minimum wage in most cases, because the company was generous enough to realize your years of laboring means you know some of the unique ways the company operates, thus you have some amount of profitable experience and skills and thus the business owners compensate you accordingly. Even though in reality you're just lifting boxes or stone or whatever menial labor job that even a child can do. Kids in Africa could easily do your job, and they do, but they get paid next to nothing in their respective African countries because of the high levels of corruption and lack of policy. You're only getting compensated this much BECAUSE of policies and the company decided to operate in your country. So in a realistic sense the company is actually compensating you FAR more than they should, on behalf of policies (policies which exist because of a strong economy thanks to your CEO's) and the CEO's generosity with their slightly higher raises over the years for your manual laboring duties. You still have enough money to clothe yourself, feed yourself and take hot showers. That might not seem like anything nowadays but those are luxurious privileges that most of the world wish they had. Even your ancestors would kill for those luxurious. So be grateful to your CEO's and business owners. \n\nAnd even in countries where there's a lack of child protection and minimum wage laws, [these factories still provide a livelihood for many families](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/04/15/how-global-value-chains-open-opportunities-for-developing-countries/), as unfortunate as that is. It speaks volumes that even when exploitation is in the forefront of a businesses operations it still provides immense benefits for a population and brings them opportunities. \n\nIt's ironic how it's normalized in this culture to poke fun at corporate and business owners and to \"flip off your boss\", but when it comes to getting a cut in your pay and benefits package or even getting fired, suddenly you people become whimpering little puppies begging your boss for the position back. Guess you shouldn't bite the hand that feeds you, huh? It's hilarious when I come across this scenario anecdotally, with my friends being extremely bitchy about their jobs than become whiny entitled children after they get fired. Goes to show how much corporate bosses and CEO's have spoiled you lots. We literally prepare our children to be indebted and work for bosses to earn their living by enrolling them in colleges and vocational schools. We have a duty to SERVE our bosses for the good they have done for America and we should be grateful for the opportunity.\n\nDo you want to know what a country looks like without ANY businesses, jobs or infrastructure? Yeah, doesn't fucking look pretty. Young men in these countries going to war against each other and their governments for resources. It's a nightmare. These people would DREAM of having businesses and jobs in their areas. Be fucking grateful.\n\nWhether you like it or not businesses have greatly increased the quality of our lives and have provided our livelihoods. Most of the population is nothing without their W-2's, so be grateful you even have the OPPORTUNITY to work.",

I've heard of performing arts students writing gushing, sanctimonious essays. Preaching about how it's supposedly wrong for someone to be cast in a role if they have the wrong shade of skin colour. \n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47468011\n\nWhilst I'm less concerned about the impact on rich a list actors. This filters down to advertising and theatre. Where performers are not rich and need every job they can get.\n\nIn an area where people of colour are already under represented why create an additional barrier. Particularly when it's not a barrier a white actor would face if they wanted to play someone  who had a tan.\n\n\nSegregation: The idea there should be accomodation and institutions only accessible to people of a certain race. In the UK there was a production of a play recently that only allowed black people at the opening night. Similarly I heard a comic on a BBC comedy podcast (nothing to do with race) call for black only schools where the curriculum is radically different and centered around race. Or in Washington university where they have already created black only campuses:\n\n\nhttps://housing.wwu.edu/black-affinity-housing\n\n\nAffirmative action/positive discrimination: the idea that people should be selected for universities or jobs, not based on their intelect and hard work. But on skin colour. \n\nIn particular the impact on Asian students who were systematically refused places based solely on skin colour. This is not only unfair on students excluded, but deeply patronising to those who were only granted places to tick boxes.\n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65792148\n\nThese elements of progressive politics are unambiguously, and nefariously racist.

So unless he spent his whole life in a sex-segregated institution like the military or a monastery, a man who can't become friends with women either A) has such lackluster social skills that he can't manage it, or B) simply doesn't view a relationship with a woman as worth pursuing on its own merits unless it has a sexual gratification component.\n\nA man who is only capable of viewing women as sexual objects, a man who does not see friendships with women as having equal value as friendships with men, that is someone who likely cannot maintain a long-term healthy romantic relationship with a woman either - because he will never respect her as an equal or as a person outside of his sexual attraction, and when that sexual attraction fades, he will lose respect for her and stop treating her well. There is no safety or long-term stability in a relationship with a man who only cares about you to the extent that it gets him off.\n\nI think therefore that when vetting a man for short or long term companionship, lack of female friends is a huge red flag that raises the possibility the man in question is either immature, or a misogynist in wait.",

  "title": "CMV: Captain America was wrong in Avenger Civil War",
  "selftext": "I know this is an old topic but i would still like to have a go at it. I think Iron Man was right in Civil War and Captain America was just being unreasonable. \n\nSo in Avenger Civil War, the world government can no longer turn a blind eye to the actions of the Avenger and passed the Sokovia Accord which states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary. There are also provisions on the regulations of enhanced individuals but that's another topic. I also won't go into details about the Accord, rather i want to look at the general idea of the Accord.\n\nTo reiterate, the Avengers - an organization comprised of some of the most powerful individuals in the history of humanity will be placed under the control of a UN panel in which they can only act after being sanctioned by said panel. As for the implementation, i imagine it would be something like the UNSC which we currently have but without the Veto power (hopefully). \n\nFor the arguments, Iron man believed that the Accord is necessary since it will legitimize the actions of the Avenger and with official public support, there would be less damage. In other words, he wants the Avenger to be held accountable for their actions.\n\nCaptain America, on the other hand, believed that the government should not be in control of the Avenger since they could abuse their power for political gains. They could stop the Avenger from doing the right things when it is necessary.\n\nIn my opinion, Captain America's view is too idealistic and too arrogant. \n\nFirst of all, the Accord wasn't the product of the US government, it was drafted and passed by 117 nations around the world. It is effectively a decision of the world. So the argument that any single nation can use it to benefit themselves is lackluster. Also, it doesn't seem the Accord can force them to do anything, they just need to have clearance when they want to do something. So the Avengers would not become some sort of tool, rather, they would only be limited in what they can do.\n\nSecond, Cap's way of thinking that the Avenger \"always knows best\" is inherently arrogant, egotistical and authoritarian. The Avengers are not infallible, in fact, after everything, they were much more prone to error than regular people. A system must able to handle the worst situation, a system that relies on factors outside of its control like \"trust\" is inherently not reliable. What if the Avengers turn rouge? what if, to protect his friends, Cap is willing to go and commit crimes? to bust his friends out of jail? Expecting a man (no matter how virtuous) to always choose the best option for all in every case is delusional. It's the rhetoric of dictators and single-party states use: \"There is no need for regulations since I/the party always knows best and will never become corrupted\".\n\nThirdly, there is also the issue of liability. The Avenger has no authority to conduct the actions they performed in any country. What gives them the right to attack people without any warrant, without giving people their day in court? What gives them the right to main, cripple and kill people without any sort of judgment or verdict? Why can the Avengers deny people their right to due process? \"Well, because they are Hydra agents\" is not a valid excuse. What gives them the right to unleash an uncontrollable behemoth with no regard for collateral damages? They made these decisions by themselves without consulting anyone and refused to take responsibility. Also, the Avengers can't just waltz into any country and do whatever they want, whenever they want in the name of \"beating up the bad guy\". They spat in the face of all those countries they fought in. \n\nIn short, this is not a viable option for using their power for the good of the people when they apparently care more about beating up bad guys than protecting people.\n\nI know this is just a comic book movie and i agree, they can do whatever they want. I'm merely saying that if you apply that scenario to the real world, Captain America would most certainly be in the wrong.",

  "title": "CMV: It's really weird that the Holocaust has been completely claimed by Jews",
  "selftext": "Just a few to things to make 100% clear. I am absolutely not denying that 6 million Jews were killed in an attempt of genocide by Nazi Germany. This is not an attempt to revise the Holocaust or deny any part of it. Quite the opposite, actually. I am also not saying in any way that Jews cannot or should not claim victim hood. They were massively victimized and are still today. These are not part of my point at all.\n\nSomething that's been bothering me for a while is that the Holocaust has been broadly accepted and talked about as purely a genocide against Jews. Most people I know who I've talked to about WWII or the Holocaust think that there were only (relatively speaking, of course) 6 million Holocaust victims. This is not true. There were 6 million victims who were Jewish. There was another 5-6 million who were not Jewish, but disabled, LGBT, and non Jewish ethnic/racial minorities. Anyone \"degenerate\" or \"inferior\".\n\nYou may be wondering why it matters. Here's why it bothers me:\n1. Nearly half of the victims of the Holocaust are practically erased by only focusing on the 6 million Jews. It's not right to suggest 6 million is inflated and it's not right to only speak on half of the victims of the Holocaust, in my view.\n2. Fascism of all kinds have similar strategies and talking points, but the Nazis and Hitler gained a special level of hatred among the general population, seemingly globally. Only focusing on the anti-Semitic propaganda and tropes causes us to miss propaganda and tropes of other groups from the same source. This is happening in the US towards several minority groups, but the parallels are ignored because we're not educated on ALL of the trash Nazi Germany pumped out and perpetrated.\n\nTo change my view, you need to explain why my concerns are moot and/or that the other 5-6 non Jewish deaths are not as ignored as I feel they are.\n\nAlso, I'm an American speaking on what I experience in America and online in mostly American communities. I don't know how Holocaust education or discourse is outside of the US.\n\nEdit: I figured this wouldn't take too long. I had assumed that other groups were treated just as bad as Jews were, but that was incorrect. There's also the fact that the Jewish population is the only group victimized that did not significantly recover from the same event. Also, I didn't realize that \"Holocaust\" is literally a term used for the Jewish deaths exclusively and the other murders are considered separately. These things have changed my view. Thanks for everyone's input and everyone who trusted that I was posting in good faith and took the time to educate!\n\nEdit 2: the amount of people calling me anti-Semitic for suggesting that we study Nazi ideology harder, in a negative light, has kinda proven my original point. A lot of people do have a really weird and alarming attitude towards the non Jewish victims. It's also become clear that at least some of the other targeted groups were actually treated just as horrific as Jews were. Also, a point of clarification, generally, people will acknowledge that there were other targeted groups, but the number is seldom mentioned. All the people telling me to \"look harder\" or whatnot are also proving my initial point that information about non Jewish victims are not as readily available and widespread as it should be. Taking any of these points as \"diminishing\" or \"downplaying\" the Holocaust or Jewish victimhood/trauma proves my position and is also ridiculous. We don't have to, and shouldn't, talk about Jews less to talk about everyone else more. I may have butchered some wording, but a lot of you are being straight up stupid",

  "selftext": "This sort of viewpoint is impossible to prove, given that there are no surveys or polling on the issue (and even if there were, there's no way to get people to respond honestly,) so it's simply my hunch, and I'm open to people changing my mind on it.\n\nThere are many issues in politics today - particularly Ukraine and Covid - on which it's pretty clear that the only, or main, reason that conservatives are opposing Thing XYZ is simply because they see liberals supporting Thing XYZ.\n\nI could cite dozens of examples, but to keep the thread short, I'll just go with two: Covid and Ukraine.\n\n At the beginning of the Covid pandemic, many conservatives actually went along with the pandemic protocols, and America actually saw a brief dip in infections (this is around the March 2020 time.) That's because Covid hadn't become \"politically sorted out yet.\"\n\nBut as time went on, and mask-wearing and social distancing became seen as a \"liberal\" thing to do, conservatives thought, \"Okay, now that libs are doing it, we have to start opposing it, otherwise we wouldn't be conservatives\" and so they started opposing vaccines, masks, distancing - for no good reason other than that libs were doing it and they felt \"If Team Blue does it, then Team Red must oppose it.\" There was no **inherent** reason why conservatives should assist a virus' spread and see America suffer heavy death tolls, other than that the libs were fighting against the virus.\n\nSame with Ukraine. Republican support for Ukraine was actually quite strong at first, around March 2022. But as time went on, and supporting Ukraine became seen as a \"Democratic\" thing to do, conservatives began opposing it. Bear in mind, again, that there's no **inherent** reason why conservatives should oppose helping Ukraine - not only was the cost of doing so extremely cheap, but historically, opposing Russia has been the Republican stance - just look at Ronald Reagan, the \"The-Soviet-Union-is-an-Evil-Empire\" president. In fact, as recently as 2012, Republicans criticized Obama *for not being tougher against Russia.* So, again, with Ukraine, it was a case of conservatives watching liberals supporting Ukraine and thinking, \"Hmmm, if they support it, we must oppose it.\"\n\nI'd even go so far as to say that **if liberals had opposed Covid anti-virus measures and opposed helping Ukraine, that conservatives would then, reflexively, have supported those anti-virus measures and supported Ukraine - to own the libs.** They might even have passed laws to punish liberals who defiantly refused to wear masks or get vaccinated.\n\nSo, that's the stance I am trying to get changed - that many (but not all) conservatives today, especially the Marjorie Taylor-Greene type, are not basing their stance off of any true principle or pillar of reason, but rather, simply because they automatically oppose whatever Team Blue supports - even if Team Blue is supporting something that's **good**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "The situation in Israel is the inspiration for this insight, but it applies to any situation where the terrorisation of civilians is being downplayed in the media. The only reason to apply any caveat to a blanket rejection of the kidnap, torture, and murder of civilians is that a person feels that they would act the same way if placed in the situation of a terrorist. However, most people would not be willing to intentionally kill civilians no matter how bad the conflict. The reason such an intention is psychopathic is because there is no logical link between such an action and any potential gain, especially when there is reason to believe that the other party will reciprocate. The only reason left to attack civilians, or to believe that there is justification for it, is that it fulfills some psychological needs that you have.\n\nedit: In response to some comments: It is important to note that having a trait of psychopathy (i.e. lack of empathy) does not necessarily make someone a psychopath.\n\nedit2: Many people have mentioned the fact that it is likely that Israel will release prisoners and this is the logic behind Hamas' gambit. I have awarded deltas on this basis, but I still have the strong reservation that nobody really expects that Israel will release more prisoners than they will kill people in response to the Hamas attack. Further if the Shalit deal is any indication, those released will mostly be accused terrorists whereas a huge portion of the Palestinians who are likely to die now will be civilians.",

I may agree with many tenets of socialist policies as well. For instsnce, socialised medicine, and the Nordic model that involves more maternity leave and other socialist policies. However, Nordic countries are all capitalist still. None of them underwent a revolution. All involved democracy to bring about change, they didn't involve the workers seizing the means of production. \n\nIt's an odd disconnect I see in subs here, one of which I was banned from for asking basic questions regarding about what measures are being taken to actually bring about revolution. I got no answers but accused of trying to debate. (this is on a learning socialism sub) However many of these same people will also go on at length about some obscure fact from  1918,and act as if the key to how things work now. Even the idea of \"seizing the means of production\" is ridiculous in a modern sense. It was created when workers could literally take over a factory. So how would someone working for a local graphic design firm seize the means of production? And also. Let's say a group of workers do unionize. That's great. But collective bargaining in a democracy is different than the October revolution by light years. And ironically the same people who claim to be trying to bring about revolution don't even vote, yet they think they'll be able to someone convince the masses to follow their ideology? We can't even get a green party candidate above 1% and suddenly the majority of the country will be following the words of a Jewish philosopher from the turn of rhe 20th century? Huh? \n\nFor these reasons I believe almost all self proclaimed communists are not interested in taking concrete steps to bring about the revolution they claim will happen any day now.

I'd like to see the evidence they have to back that up.\n\nBut even if a 20 year old woman is dating somebody's 60 y/o grandpa, that is their choice and being upset about it is futile.

Perhaps forming when antient people would confuse dreams and reality, or perhaps a personification of natural occurrences like lightning or wind.\n\nBut surely these bugs would be an evolutionary disadvantage. - If you work up a sweat doing a rain dance, you'll die of thirst quicker! So why do the ideas persist. \n\nTo me, it's not a great explanation for why religions last for thousands of years. And almost every civilization independently constructs their own religious system. \n\nIt makes a lot more sense to assume they have some kind of evolutionary advantage. \n\nI believe a better explanation for their proliferation is it is fundamental to how we interpret reality. Durkenheim makes the argument that many successful political movements are religious in form. Post revolutionary France had sacred objects like the Tricolour, divine rights like 'egality, fraternity and liberty', and rituals like Bastille Day. \n\nIn fact if you think about your own community or friendship group, it likely has a lot of these features. Even atheists have objects they consider sacred (for me it's my first guitar - which I value far more than its retail value), rituals - for us it's going to pub and then ordering 100 chicken mcnuggets (we're gross I know), or arbitrary rules - never order a steak well done, never leave a pint half drunk etc.\n\nThe basic elements of religion are ubiquitous in any social group. Whether they invent a specific god for their belief or not. Though you could quite easily argue many of us deify our heroes - musicians, writers, artists. \n\nIf someone gave you a pen that was owned by some guy down the road, it wouldn't really have any meaning to you. But if I told you it was owned by your favourite writer, suddenly it would take on a whole new importance. Despite materially just being the same pen.\n\nI think this way of thinking is fundamental to how we intuit the world. To how we assign value and how we narrow our focus from the vast array of sensory input we are constantly bombarded with.\n\nAs a kind of mental triage, our brains are hardwired to assign value to certain objects and to gravitate towards certain hueristics and rules. Repeat certain behaviours that comfort us. \n\nIt is these cornerstone's that define religion (according to durkenheim) and also govern the way our cognition works on a basic level. As if we are born with a blank template to understand the world, that we then fill with objects, rituals and rules that we are taught. And this template can be understood to be synonymous with religious thinking.",

  "selftext": "This post is in no way denying Israel's multitude of war crimes. It also does not deny Hamas' war crimes. For this conversation, Hamas is referring to the military organization.\n\nI believe that in order to fix the situation the first step towards a solution not involving the genocide of more than a million people is for the Palestinian people to begin practicing nonviolence in response to Israeli war crimes.\n\nMy reasoning for this is as follows:\n\n1. All violence will inevitably lead to more violence without someone breaking the cycle first\n\n2. Hamas will never be able to kill enough Israelis to make them consider leaving, and will not be able to kill the entire population. There is no endgame with these attacks that does not involve the genocide of the Palestinian people.\n\n3. If Hamas continues to use violent means, such as shooting rockets into Israel from Gaza or actions like the October 7th attack, Israel will use these actions as justification for their own attacks, ending up in for more Palestinian civilians dead than Israelis\n\n4. Hamas' attacks will further alienate the Israelis, creating a farther and farther right wing government until they genocide the Palestinians.\n\n5. The Israeli children are the ones most in danger of being alienated from Palestinians, with some of them facing attacks and the majority hearing about attacks on fellow Israelis from the POV of Israeli media, which likely exaggerates numbers and rhetoric to further radicalize. If instead Palestinian non-violence begins Israeli children will grow up in a situation in which Palestinians have never done anything to them or their Israelis, there will be no sense they need to get revenge for, and once they begin their IDF service they will view the Palestinians as civilians instead of terrorists, leading to less war crimes against the Palestinian people.\n\n6. The international community that currently supports Israel will also begin to heavily lean towards Palestine's cause, viewing them as a genocided people being oppressed by a foreign government instead of Nazis hiding terrorist soldiers in their mosques and schools\n\n7. With the International community and the sizable Israeli Gen Alpha and Beta (28% currently) turning more Pro-Palestine the Israeli government will be forced to become more left-wing, leading to less violence towards Palestinian Civilians.\n\nEdit: I do not agree with u/Miserable_Amoeba7217 in almost every comment he's made but I don't have time to respond to them because he's made so many.",

  "selftext": "I think ABA therapy is abuse for autistic children, here is why\n\n1: ABA Is like dog training but for autistic people (mostly children). It is all about obedience and compliance. If the child does something that the therapist likes, they get a reward. If the child does something the therapist doesn't like, they get a punishment or as they call it, a \"negative reinforcement). I know that a lot of ABA centres these days don't use negative reinforcement but with positive inforcements, they are manipulating the child or the client to do what the therapist wants them to do.\n\n2: In a lot of these places, food is used as a reward so food will be withheld from the child until the child does what the therapist wants them to do. You don't ever withhold food from a child, ever.\n\n3: In a lot of these places, non-harmful stims are supressed and the child is forced or manipulated into making eye contact with the therapist. This teaches masking which can lead to mental health issues which can lead to a lot of horrible things (such as suicide). The suicide rate for autistic people is much higher than for people who are not autistic. I know making eye contact is what you are \"supposed\" to do but if a person forces themselves to make eye contact to the point where they have mental health issues/burnout. It is a problem. \n\n4: ABA teaches their clients that their feelings/boundaries don't matter. If the child needs a break, give them a break. Respect that. If they are overwhelmed and need a break, give them a break. If they don't like loud noises/touch, respect that\n\nA lot of people say that it's different now. But ask yourself. Is your child forced to surpress their stims or make eye contact? Are they being punished or manipulated into compliance? Is food withheld from them? Are their boundaries being respected?\n\nI know things changes with time, but how much has ABA really changed?",

  "selftext": "Alternative title: Franchise shouldn't be punished for the action of an independent local franchise. \n\nWhat this post is NOT about and disclaimers \n1) Pro Israel: I support Palestine. I'm not going to argue with this here as this is not the point of the post. \n\n2) McDonald's or Burger King should have never been boycott: I'm sure you could point to xyz but the recent accusation to boycott is what I'm talking about specifically. \n\n If you want to boycott a restaurant for whatever reason, that's fine. However, there is a difference between a \"personal boycott\" and a boycott that is called by mass and anyone who supports the business will have their character judge. Sometimes that scenerio makes sense but I have hard to time thinking McDonald's and Burger King should apply from this situation. (I'm emphasizing this situation) \n\nFacts 1:\nThe official BDS movement request we boycott McDonald's/Burger King and others because of their support  of Israel. \n\n(I looked into the bdsmovement.net after writing this post and this is what I found. According to bdsmovement.net, boycotts against these \"grassroots organic boycott\" aren't initiated by the BDS so it's confusing if it the BDS wants2 Pro-Palestinians to boycott or not. The article was written by the Palestinian BDS National Committee so I say yes for now) \n\nFacts 2:\nMcDonald's Israel and Burger King Israel have supported Israel. (McDonald's Israel gave troops food and Burger King Israel made a support post on social media)  [insert citation] \n\nFact 3:\nFact 2 is why many Pro-Palestinians boycott all McDonald's and Burger King around the world. \n\nFact 4:.\nMcDonald's and Burger King are US based franchises. \n\nMy issue is that McDonald's Israel nor Burger King  Israel isn't representative of what the base US franchise thinks. This isn't a like a CEO saying a racial slur where that reflects on the base company. How does giving McDonald's or BK money in the US hurt Palestinians? None of that money magically teleports to the land of Israel unless you are living in Israel and giving those franchises money. If it did then the boycott would make sense. That's why itself not really correct to say McDonald's or Burger King did X if you are referring to an independent franchise that isn't connected to the main branch. \n\n\nEven then there are McDonald franchises who shown support of Palestine and donated to Gaza. So saying \"McDonald's gave money to Gaza\" should also be just as valid of a  statement just as much as \"McDonald's gave IDF good\". I couldn't find anything connects Israel to the McDonald's franchise.\n\nReminds of the #boycottihop because a tone deaf sign at one restaurant as if one random store owners opinion dictates how IHOP feels. \n\nNot complete defense for these companies as We can shift the goal post and claim the problem is their \"compliance\" as McDonald's and Burger King isn't shutting down those franchise for their actions. Thats a better reason to boycott but even then I dont think giving them your money is really judge one's character. As I said, this is a goal post shift as this is not why the boycott against McDonald's and other franchise started. I'm sure these companies have done other terrible actions you personally would stop supporting them because of those actions but they aren't relevant for my post. \n\nCMV.",

  "title": "CMV: From a purely legal view, overturning Roe v Wade was the correct decision",
  "selftext": "I really need some legal scholars here; just a heads up this is a *long* one.\n\nI read through *Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organization*, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn *Roe v Wade* and by extension *Planned Parenthood v Casey*, which reaffirmed *Roe* in 1992.\n\nTo start: I am not a legal expert by *any* means.  I also want to clearly define what I mean by \"a purely legal point of view\".  To me, the law is impartial, strict, and occasionally heartless.  It should be a logical process in which cases are examined and judged on whether they follow the guidelines society has chosen to run by; in this case, the Constitution and its amendments.  Personal morals and beliefs should never be in consideration when the law is involved, if possible.\n\nFor example, there was a case where a truck driver offered to help unload his truck when the receiving company was short staffed.  He was hurt, and sued the company to pay his medical bills, as the trucking company he worked for said he was not performing duties under his contract, and therefore was ineligible for their own insurance.  The jury determined since the driver volunteered to help, the receiving company was not responsible for his injuries either.  The guy was screwed.\n\nI think most of us would agree that we feel terrible for the driver, and that from a moral and social viewpoint, the result is a tragedy.  I agree.  However, from a *legal* viewpoint, the law worked perfect in this case.  In a society of millions of people all interacting, we must have a legal system that remains constant in its application and is not susceptible to being altered by personal beliefs.\n\nIf we don't like the result, the law should be changed, but *not* by the court.  The court should not decide \"Well, in this case, I think we should do something different\".  Society should decide that the law needs to be different.  But the law should never be changed for specific judgements.  It may be heartless, but it provides a solid baseline for our legal system to stay consistent, and not up to the whims of judges.\n\nLet's jump into the Supreme Court's repeal of *Roe*.\n\nThis is vastly oversimplified, but the majority's decision to overturn *Roe* was based on multiple points:\n\n* There is no legal precedence; *stare decisis* is heavily influential in many rulings, and there are no prior rulings regarding abortion.\n* For historical precedent, abortion has been illegal in many states, and there is very little history of it really being a huge thing--throughout history, more kids has always been better.  A significant chunk of the population not wanting kids is a recent development.  *Roe* was uncharted territory.\n* *Roe* and *Casey* both had their detractors and criticisms even when they announced, and even some of the justices in favor of it had reservations-it has never been a solid, bedrock agreement.  *Casey*, reaffirming *Roe*, actually dropped all the original amendments used in *Roe* to argue for abortion except the 14th amendment.\n* Both *Roe* and *Casey* agree that the state/society has a vested interest in a \"potential life\", and depending at the time of pregnancy, the mother does not have full decision in the matter.\n* The court also made note that *Roe* and *Casey* both wanted the matter to be over.  As the abortion debate very much is not over, they argue the rulings have not solved the issue, and they are well within their rights to reexamine the decisions.\n* There are virtually zero laws classifying how fetuses are regarded.  There is no codified way that we treat fetal life.\n* *Roe* and *Casey* can read almost like legislative acts, setting out guidelines and rules about abortion that they did kind of make up on their own (basically viability outside of the mother was the cut off point).\n\nWith all the above, the Court ruled that it had vastly overstepped its powers by effectively creating legislation on how abortion is handled in the US.  They favored returning the power to the states and the people's elected representatives (they liked to phrase it as 'returning power to the people' a lot, ironically enough).\n\nWith all of the above, I... kind of have to agree that it was the correct decision to overturn *Roe v Wade*, from a purely legal point of view.  The Supreme Court is supposed judge cases that are brought before it to see if they fall in the confines of the law.\n\nBut there *are* no laws on abortion or fetal life on a national scale-it's a free for all between the states.  There is nothing in the Constitution or amendments on abortion besides the 14th Amendment (as declared by *Casey*), and the Due Process Clause prohibiting the deprivation of \"life, liberty, or property\" falls apart if you believe the fetus is fully human, because they deserve life and liberty too.  *Roe* and *Casey* compromised by using viability, and did in a sense say \"All right, here are the rules from now on\".\n\nThe Constitution declares that all other powers not listed as the federal government's are to be given to the states.  Regardless if you like this or not, this is how our legal system has operated.  And I do think our justices should be impartial arbitrators who make there decisions based upon the law, and the law alone.\n\nI know the conservative justices didn't make this decision for those reasons.  I know they have a conservative agenda that they have finally been able to push through, and this also-fucking-lutely was because of their own moral beliefs and political ambitions.  But this makes them hypocritical assholes who I would love to see removed from power; it doesn't affect the validity their arguments.\n\nAfter reading through the document, I can't find a reason to disagree with the court.  They thought a contentious issue that has virtually no prior cases or historical precedent should not be decided by the Supreme Court, but be left up to the states to decide.\n\nI can't really find a legal reason to disagree with their reasoning that the Supreme Court should not be able to decisively decide the issue when there really isn't anything in the past for them to decide about.  This would be very different if we had ANY laws defining fetal life and their rights, but we don't.  How can the court make a decision about an issue that basically has no laws behind it?  They have to legislate to do so.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the dissenting opinion.  Most of their counterarguments were that the wording the majority used would allow states to pretty much ban abortion if they wanted, and how it would negatively affect many woman's lives, and the huge clusterfuck on the horizon.  Basically everything that's happened since.\n\nBut those are moral and humanistic arguments, not legal ones.  I think the dissenting opinion is correct, but I can't see a good *legal* reason they are correct.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo.  I read a document that obviously is going to show the opinion to overturn *Roe v Wade* in a positive light, and I have the barest knowledge of the law.  But I cannot find legal reasons to disagree with the majority, and the dissenting opinion didn't offer much more.\n\nI said at the start that I firmly believe the law should be impartial, strict, and even occasionally heartless if it is to maintain standards that do not deviate over time.  I firmly believe our judicial system cannot bend for any other reasons than legal reasons if it is to endure--even if it gives results that we don't like.\n\nI can think of tons of moral, rational, hell, even philosophical arguments on why *Roe v Wade* should not have been overturned, but am at a loss with legal ones.  Can anyone help me out?",

  "selftext": "Forced representation of minorities (POC, LGBT people, etc) usually turn other members of society against the minorities. By forced representation, I mean changing the race of a established characters, intentionally make certain characters worse/wrong in an an reasonable manner only to make certain characters look better, etc.\n\nThe goal of representation is to normalize the appearance of minorities in medias by giving them more exposure. This is a reasonable effort but the current method of forced representation only makes things worse for the following reasons:\n\n1. You can not normalize something by making a big deal out of it. If everytime the media does something to promote representation, they have to make a big deal out of it then how do they expect people to get used to it? Trying to bait people with headlines about the first this, the first that is never going to get people to normalize those things,\n\n2. Forced representation such as race swapping only make minorities stand out more as opposed to becoming mundane. If you swap the race of an established character, that will be all everyone is focused on. Also, it will turn other people who loved the character into your opposition. A character's look is important to fans and fans don’t like change. Antagonizing people will only hurt your cause.\n\n3. Race swapping established characters do not empower minorities. If anything, it shows that minorities have nothing to call their own and have to steal established characters. It implies that minorities have no imagination and cannot come up with compelling characters and stories while the reality is the opposite. \n\n4. Endorsing forced representation kills off the opportunities for original POC characters and stories. Why create new POC characters that might not pan out when we can just race swap existing characters? If the medias truly care about actual representation then they should give original POC characters and stories more chance as opposed to regurgitating the same characters just with a different skin tone.\n\nI believe the reason behind the current state of representation is due to the impatient nature of Americans (which I am not), or at least this generation of Americans. They want instant gratification and results, they want to solve big problems instantly and with no effort but that is not how life works. These efforts take years if not decades to go anywhere but since most people don’t really care about their so-called causes, their attention span cannot last that long. For example: Lets say there are more successful men in Wall street than women. If you want to change that, you would have to start from the bottom. Encourage little girls to take an interest in the stockmarket, destroy the stereotypes of only man can be successful Wall street bankers, etc. But such efforts take years or decades to actually show results. Instead, they would say that Wall Street is sexist and demand that big trade companies take in more women. Basically, they want the roof but dont want to build the foundation. Such cheap representation does nothing but:\n\n1. Make minorities complacent about their position in society despite no actual changes being done;\n\n2. Antagonize minorities in the eyes of certain people who would have been neutral otherwise;\n\n3. Give privileged people a dose of dopamine and make them forget about making actual changes to help out minorities.\n\nIn the end, it only appealed to the egos of the privileged and provides no meaningful changes in the lives of minorities, or even worse, prevents any actual changes from being enacted.",

Notice how English has less variation and these are the simple tenses if we take into account the other tenses (Spanish has imperfect past, perfect past, conditional etc)  this diffence is staggering.

And no needlessly confusing clutter of prepositions and conjunctions to use, instead opting for clear and unique words that don't have many synonyms. For example, which in Portuguese has a lot of synonyms which you have to keep changing them to not make your text repetitive. And of course, English grammar doesn't have any tones except apostrophes, when Portuguese has 4 main ones: á, à, ã, â. But I want to know what are the struggles of people who do write English and are native speakers, because I think their experience would be different than mine because I don't write English in a professional manner. Sorry for any grammar mistakes",

  "selftext": "First of all, nobody should ever get shamed or attacked for the way they look. Everybody has the right to live a peacefull live.\n\nHow ever I base my opinion on a few arguments and my studies in sport sciences:\n\n1.) Health: The human body is designed to function a certain way. In order to do so it needs a certain amount of body fat which vary from person to person. For example women tend to have higher body fat than man, old people more then younger people etc. . Being far above or below that percentage has a huge  impact on your health, I won't even try to name all, I am sure you know those. By assuring people with a irregular body fat, that it is absolutely ok to be that way BY CHOICE ( I am explicitly excluding mental illness here) the pressure to change is marginalised leading to increased social costs, doctors etc.\n\n2.) Hypocratic Beauty standards: Firstly beauty is of course in the eye of the viewer and every person is beautiful in their own way.\n\nYet evolutionary people tend to find people attractive that have a high functionality and good chances of survival. The portrayed beauty standards of for example Kim K., or the Rock are in my opinion considered attractive because they overexaggerate those traits linked to fertility and functionality. Those traits are directly influenced by one's body fat. If, for example, a woman or man has a extremely low body fat, the ability to reproduce is heavily impaired up to temporary infertility. Choosing to be obese or emaciated AND demanding to be considered beautiful is in my opinion hypocracy.\n\n3.) Fairness towards others:\nBy focusing heavily on people who don't meet beauty standards BY CHOICE, attention is taken away from people that don't meet them because they may have had an accident or genetic defect. Those people deserve to be told they are beautiful, they don't have the power to change that and they need to be explicitly included and be \"taken care of\" taking up this space simply because of one's unwillingness to change is unfair.\n\n\nI would love to hear some arguments as I am probably biased, and would love to expand my horizon.

Here are some examples of the systems of oppression also being bad for white people:\n\n* Mass incareration is extremely expensive. The government spends tens of billions of dollars a year just to make the labor force smaller. Obviously only a fraction of this is black people being imprisoned due to racism, but it is one of the most concrete effects of systemic racism.\n* Employment discrimination. Yes, it helps white people get slightly nicer jobs, but, again, there is currently a labor shortage and those costs are just passed to the (majority white) consumers.\n* More broadly, the most historically racist parts of the US, the parts which had slavery and the Jim Crow south, are now the poorest parts of the country. Even the white people in these parts of the country are poor.

These are very much in opposition to the global consensus on the resolution of Israel/Palestine. As long as he remains in power, there will be no peace in the region.\n\nWe know that he will most likely go after the conflict, given his attempts at judicial reforms and security failure on Oct 7th, which means whoever comes in next will be responsible for the path forward. In order for this path to be workable, this person must also be in charge of Israel's actions during the war. For example, let's say Lapid will come into power after Netanyahu and wants to initiate some kind of peace process with Palestinians. In order for this idea to work, the IDF will need to be a lot more cautious than if they were under Netanyahu's command. \n\nEssentially, the path after the conflict must align with the path taken during it, and that is only possible with one Prime Minister in charge. Assuming that Bibi will not be PM after the conflict, he cannot be the Prime Minister now too.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, the point I'm making is not that there must be a two-state solution, is that whatever arrangement comes after the conflict, be it military occupation, civil occupation, two-state, etc must align with the operations being conducted right now.

  "selftext": "\r  \nSexual objectification is defined as treating a person solely as an object of sexual desire. This concept is surprisingly at the heart of how we understand sexual orientation. When someone identifies as heterosexual or homosexual, their primary indicator of attraction is fundamentally based on physical characteristics. This is objectification in its most straightforward form.\r  \n\r  \nOur sexual attractions are not within our control; they arise spontaneously. To deny this, to ignore the innate influence of our visual senses, is to make hollow statements. This attraction is not a conscious choice but an intrinsic part of our identity.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it's true that sexual attraction can develop over time for some, my focus here is on the initial, instinctive aspect of attraction that is predominantly physical. \r  \n\r  \nTake platonic friendships as an example. Deep bonds based on personality and emotional connections are common, yet in heterosexual contexts, these alone do not lead to sexual attraction. This illustrates that sexual attraction is fundamentally rooted in physical attributes – an initial objectification.\r  \n\r  \nAcknowledging the role of physical attributes in attraction should not be viewed as problematic or shallow. In the quest for romantic connections, physical appeal often serves as the initial catalyst. This instinctual part of human sexuality, our natural response to certain physical traits, often initiates deeper, more meaningful connections.\r  \n\r  \nHence, when men or women are drawn to each other primarily for physical traits, this isn’t something to be condemned. It’s a fundamental aspect of human attraction. To deny this is to overlook an essential element of our nature.

For the purposes of this post it refers to the modern way it’s commonly used, i.e. far-left “anti-imperialists” who tend to hate the nebulous West. \n\nI’m talking about the Grayzone/Multipolarista types, the Max Blumenthals, Ben Nortons, and their ilk. To them, the concept of democracy is secondary to the demise of Western power. \n\nThey present themselves as anti-imperialists because they ostensibly support the liberation of smaller “global south” nations under the grip of global hegemony. Now, I’m all for anti-imperialism in principle, every country should have the maximum amount of self determination possible to shepherd their people into as prosperous a future as possible without some big power boot on their neck. 100%. \n\nThe problem I have with tankies in this context is that anti-imperialism should be pro-democracy. But that is not what’s emanating from these circles. \n\nIn practice, what it looks like is simply being anti-West. If the US, Europe, or their allies are in *any* way even tangentially involved in some geopolitical conflict or dispute, it doesn’t matter what the conflict is, or where it is, or what the motivations are, or who is involved, or what they are doing, the other side is *always right* to these people. \n\nThey seem to giddily support all manner of autocratic brutality as long as it is done in the service of damaging the West’s influence in the world. Everything is a zero-sum game, and the West must never win it no matter what the cost. \n\nThey deny atrocities and push any manner of conspiracy theories (White helmets being false flag terrorists. China not committing atrocities against Uyghurs, no chemical weapons use in Syria, etc.) that would put their favorite dictators in a bad light and, by extension, advance the Western position. \n\nLook at Syria, Russia, China, Venezuela, Cuba, etc. There is seldom even the slightest, most tepid condemnation for the crimes that these governments impose on their own people and others, because they are “fighting” or “resisting” western influence, and by virtue of that, they can do no wrong in the context of this great power struggle. \n\nI have yet to see any evidence that they would be willing to forcefully condemn “non-west” dictators for anything they do, as long as the US/Europe oppose them, or any evidence that they would support a democratic cause if it would somehow benefit the west at the expense of great power rivals, but I'm open to hearing opposing views.",

  "selftext": "The world population is currently 8 billion people and is projected to reach 10 billion by 2050. This rapid population growth is putting a strain on our planet's resources and contributing to climate change. In order to achieve sustainability, we need to take steps to reduce the world population.\n\nOne of the most important steps we can take is to educate women and girls about family planning. When women have access to education and contraception, they are more likely to choose to have smaller families. This is already having a positive impact in many parts of the world. For example, in India, the fertility rate has fallen from 6 children per woman in 1960 to 2.2 children per woman today.\n\nAnother important step is to improve access to healthcare. When people have access to healthcare, they are more likely to live longer and healthier lives. This means that they will have fewer children, as they will not need to rely on their children for support in old age.\n\nWe also need to address the root causes of poverty. Poverty is a major driver of population growth. When people are poor, they are more likely to have large families, as they need more children to help them survive. We need to invest in education, healthcare, and economic development in order to lift people out of poverty and reduce the need for large families.\n\nFinally, we need to change our cultural attitudes towards population growth. In many cultures, having a large family is seen as a sign of wealth and status. We need to challenge these attitudes and promote the idea that having a small family is a responsible choice.\n\nReducing the world population is essential for achieving sustainability. By taking steps to educate women and girls, improve access to healthcare, address poverty, and change cultural attitudes, we can make a real difference.\n\nIn addition to the points I have already made, it is also important to consider the impact of population growth on consumption and emissions. As the world population grows, so does our demand for resources. This is putting a strain on our planet's ecosystems and contributing to climate change. For example, the production of food, energy, and goods consumes a significant amount of resources and produces greenhouse gases. If we want to reduce our impact on the planet, we need to reduce our consumption. And one of the best ways to do that is to reduce the world population.\n\nA smaller population would mean less demand for resources and less pollution. This would help to protect our planet and ensure a sustainable future for all.\n\nI believe that reducing the world population is the most important step we can take to achieve sustainability. It is a complex issue, but it is one that we must address if we want to leave a livable planet for future generations.",

  "selftext": "i do not protest these two points: \n\n1) when an atom is moving it experiences fewer oscillations compared to atoms that aren't moving.\n\n2) when atoms are in the midst of a dense mass of other atoms, all the atoms in the mass slow when compared to atoms in less dense groupings.\n\nneither of these phenomena leads me to believe that time is a thing, nor property of a thing, nor a plane of existence within which anything can traverse. \n\nmy conception of time is a standard of the movement and progress/decay of one thing relative to another, if either thing in any specific compared relationship were manipulated so that the expected relative outcome was altered, that would not be time travel.\n\nif i use a standardized weight to measure a mass i must specify under what circumstances i make the comparison. if i alter those circumstances for future measurements i have to do some math to compensate. i cannot say i am creating or destroying mass/gravity by altering the circumstances of the measurement.\n\nif i say that a fredmeasure (fm) is the distance defined by how far fred can run before fred needs to rest, then i proceed to measure various distances by how many times fred needs to rest between objects, you might see how it would be only marginally useful. if i add lead weights to fred's shoes that would cause fm distances to increase but it would be obviously foolish of me to extrapolate that lead weight therefore expands space instead of exhausting fred. it isn't that the distance changed, but that my method of measurement was at best only approximating distance and only then while under static conditions. likewise, if you use the oscillations of cesium-133 as your standard unit and then proceed to alter its conditions so that its oscillations are relatively slower or faster, it might be incorrect to conclude the relative change in oscillations means that time has been locally altered, as if time (fundamentally a measurement, not a driving force or plane of existence) were somehow driving the change in oscillations instead of the circumstances affecting the medium being measured.\n\nwhen we say \"time travel\" we imagine jumping to previous configurations of matter and energy as they once were, or jumping to configurations of matter as they will someday be. slowing or speeding the movement of atoms doesn't come close to approximating what we mean by \"time travel\". we don't care about how cesium-133 has oscillated directly only as a means to some other ends. if oscillating the atoms in reverse were feasible it would be ridiculous to call that time traveling into the past just as speeding them up is not traveling to the future. it is nonsense because it doesn't get close to what we seek, and because, just like the fm unit, it is only a flawed yardstick by which we measure the things we care about.\n\nto find a building on a map you can give latitude and longitude. the latitude and longitude are only useful if the budding is still there; it isn't the latitude and longitude you want but the building. the same is true of events and time. you might say that you want to travel in time to october 4, 1957. those are coordinates in time, what you really want to do is be present during the launch of sputnik1 just as it happened. you don't care about the coordinates just about the configuration of matter and energy as it was. likewise, you don't care about traveling to the future, you care to see what things will be like as matter and energy progress to some fantastical configuration. it is the movement, decay, and evolution that happened or will happen that interests you. time isn't any more than a standardized measurement of motion and change of matter as a means to some other ends. as such, traveling on/in it is nonsense.\n\ntangentially, i've repeatedly heard that time isn't the same in a black hole as it is in a vacuum far from matter. i've heard that there can't be a standard clock. i say there can be, i say that we can pick any arbitrary frequency and set it as a standard. it would only work as a sufficient standard if we keep its circumstances static and if its frequency is reliable under static circumstances. using any such standard has only marginal utility compared to some as yet unknown thing that isn't affected by matter and movement. then again, in many cases, it might be more useful to have a yardstick that changes proportionally to our circumstances such as it is with the oscillations of cesium-133. having such a standardized time is what we have already done and it is as useful as we need it to be especially because we know how to compensate for conditional speeding and slowing.",

My revised opinion is that Asia will replace Europe as the second most powerful/influential region in the world.\n\n\nPeople have gotten used to the idea that \"the West\" (a nebulous term at best, here I'll roughly define it as western Europe and North America) is the dominant force in the world. Western countries are the richest and have their tendrils all over the world because they've been so dominant for so long. It almost seems like the natural state of things.\n\nBut it isn't, it's a historical abnormality. For most of human history the most important and powerful countries in the world were in Asia. It's easy to understand why, Asia is where most people live. It's the largest continent and the eastern half of Asia has always been densely populated. If you draw a circle that includes China, India, and southeast Asia, your circle will include most of humanity.\n\nWestern Europe had a technological revolution and industrialized. This upset the normal state of affairs and allowed for European colonialism then western dominance. This head start allowed the West to maintain dominance for a long time but that head start is rapidly disappearing. Technology and industry are no longer unique to the West and if you haven't noticed, Asia has gotten pretty good at both. At this point it's only a matter of time until the balance of power shifts back to Asia.\n\nHow could it not? It's simple numbers. More people means more inventions, more money, more labor, more and better ideas, larger armies, larger economies, etc.",

True!

  "selftext": "My argument is basically a two-point case. I believe the following:\n\n1. Gun control will never be passed in the United States at a federal level, which is the only way it could work, because otherwise someone truly determined to commit a mass shooting can just go to a neighboring state with more lax gun laws.\n2. Even if gun control were passed on a federal level, it wouldn't work.\n\nPOINT 1: \n\nLook, it's no secret that the massacres keep happening more and more frequently. I tend to agree with that British journalist who said that Sandy Hook was the end of the gun control debate. Gun violence has gone from a generation-defining tragedy to something that happens every day in America. Events like Uvalde that remain in the news for a few weeks are the exception, not the rule. Plus, the general public seems to care less and less about the fact that the US is a total warzone. As an example, Greg Abbott, a very pro-gun violence politician, won 60 percent in the vote in Uvalde County even after the Robb Elementary massacre. Other countries have started putting travel warnings against the US, and still nothing ever changes even as our foreign relations suffer. I don't have any serious expectation that things will change enough for gun control to be passed federally. However, that's not even the biggest obstacle to putting an end to this plague.\n\nPOINT 2:\n\nTo those who would say that other countries have solved this problem, I'm not going to deny that. However, Canada, Australia, Germany, and other countries never had the same gun culture that we did. The US has twice as many guns per capita as fucking YEMEN. If gun control were passed tomorrow, I expect gun sales to massively increase the way they do after every high-profile mass shooting. The Second Amendment people will say \"They're trying to take our guns!\" and they'll arm up even further. Even if that doesn't happen, there are still too many guns floating around, so the only real solution is for the government to forcibly confiscate them, which would probably end in even more violence. *Even in the best-case scenario, gun violence would continue, it just wouldn't increase as exponentially as it is right now.* \n\nAs you can imagine, I desperately want my view changed, because I don't want to believe that I have to move to another country. I just hate seeing the US devolve into a civil warzone. \n\nEDIT: My view has been changed marginally, but I still don't have much hope for the future.",

It says the right of The People. In every other place The Constitution attributes a right to The People—it is referring to an individual right belonging to all Americans. Why would “right of The People” have any other meaning here?\n\n2.) The amendment also does not grant any rights. It implies there is an existing, inherent right of The People to keep and bear arms and simply instructs the government that it is not to infringe upon this right and presents one reason why. \n\n3.) There is no way a reasonable person can read that objectively and conclude that it was written to LIMIT a right or that it does so in any way. I cannot see how anyone who speaks English as their first language could interpret it that way.\n\n4.) The first part of the amendment states one reason for the second. It is clearly not a condition. A popular analogy of sorts goes like this: \n\n“A well balanced breakfast being necessary to the start of a healthy day, the right of The People to keep and eat food shall not be infringed.”\n\nWho has the right to keep and eat food? A well balanced breakfast? Or The People? \n\nDoes this imply people can only eat food during breakfast or only eat breakfast foods? \n\nNo, clearly it implies that The People alright have the right to keep and eat food and instructs the government, unconditionally, that it is not to infringe upon that right. \n\n5.) I maintain that because the meaning is clear enough, arguments that it limits the right in any way or which drill into minutia about the definitions of “well-regulated” and “militia” are inherently disingenuous and intended to obfuscate and undermine the right and serve no other purpose. \n\n6.) I believe the motive for this is quite clear. Gun control proponents know they do not have anywhere near the political capital needed to repeal the amendment with 2/3 of Congress, much less the 75% of the statehouses required to ratify. \n\nIt’s extraordinarily unlikely to be repealed in any of our lifetimes or even our grandchildren’s lifetimes. The 2nd remains the single greatest long-term obstacle to advancing more ambitious gun control legislation. \n\nTherefore sowing any doubt they can and confusing people about the meaning of the amendment or the protections it afford us is the ‘next best thing’ to repeal.\n\nSo, this bad faith argument is kept at a low boil constantly. The most well-informed people who make it don’t even believe it, unless they’ve successfully deluded themselves.\n\nCMV",

It was always just used on par with typical insults to intelligence like stupid, dumb, or idiot, and now it's a slur?\n\nLet's adress some arguments from the other side.\n1. It was originally a medical term to describe disabled people, and so using it is the same as calling somebody disabled as an insult, which is disrespectful to disabled people.\n\nWord definitions change. Dumb once meant somebody who couldn't read, so is it disrespectful to people who can't read if I use it as an insult? No, because nobody uses it like that anymore. The same went for the \"r word\". If we're deciding a word is offensive or a slur based off of its past definitions, then there are so many common words that are slurs now. Idiot would literally have to be forbidden and referred to as the \"I slur\".\n\n2. How hard is it to just not say it?\n\nWhy should I have to change my vocabulary because of an idea that isn't really easily defensible?\n\nAs much as I hate to misrepresent the other side, these are really the only counter-arguments I could think of.\n\nAlso, context matters. For instance- a sibling of yours does something stupid and annoying. You called them the \"r word\". Did you do this to insult any disabilities they had? If yes, you have used it as a slur. They were disabled and you called them it because of that. But most likely, that was not the case. Most often, you probably used it as a typical insult like stupid, dumb, idiot, imbecile, whatever your choice. You see my point now? Nobody ever really uses it as a slur, so why did it become one? Well, I have one theory, and I'm 99% confident it's correct. The internet saw that nothing bad had happened in a while, and so they found something to be mad about. This tends to happen. Remember when people tried to cancel Mr. Beast because no controversies had happend in a good while? These people LIVE off of drama, and so they'll go as far as to declare normal words \"slurs\" just so they can create more people to cancel and more things to be mad about.

  "title": "cmv: Christians who wholeheartedly believe Jesus was killed and rose from the dead are bordering on complete delusion.",
  "selftext": "Edit 5:) I’ve already conceded my “point” about institutionalization. Some people seem to be missing my point, the man claim is  literally that what he believes is undeniable fact! Im calling that into question here.\n\nI read an article today by a Yale *Finance* professor that may well be the most egregious defense of the divine I’ve ever heard (read). He begins with typical Christian rhetoric on how all he needs to justify his perspective is faith. Which is pretty weak argumentation for the bold statements he makes. \n\nHe then goes bonkers with his claims. The first statement is that there is falsifiable evidence for the resurrection. Quite the bold claim when bringing life back after systemic shutdown has never been done. This man is a professor at one of the post prestigious universities in the United States. Despite this incredible achievement displaying his intellect, he believes in the impossible. Shouldn’t any argument claiming zombification be instantly disregarded? Is it not common sense that such a thing is not biologically possible. \n\nIt seems to me at least that this line of thinking surpasses any suspension of disbelief. With zero evidence to back this claim, he proposes that it can be rationally proven? Though it’s never been done, so many Christians’ in academia support absurd claims like this. How are opinions like this treated as valid and sane? If such a thing cannot be recreated by any scientific means, and the only evidence exists in a 2 thousand+ year old book. How do people deny all sense of logic and critical thinking and make redundant statements like this without realizing their own delusion. He goes on to say that it is more likely the resurrection is factual, than it is likely 2 billion people believe in something false. \n\nI’ve never been a fan of religion, I’ll be 100% honest. However I pride myself in at least hearing their arguments and opinions, after all we are human all the same. But this feels like something that should land you in a mental institution.\n\nEdit 1:) My choice of using delusion may be ill advised if someone can help me to find a more appropriate word for describing belief in the impossible I would greatly appreciate it. \n\nEdit 2:) His first bit of evidence.\n\nThere is credible evidence for Jesus’ death and resurrection\nNon-Christian philosopher of religion Antony Flew: “The evidence for the resurrection is better than for claimed miracles in any other religion. It’s outstandingly different in quality and quantity.”\n \n\nTHE LIKELIHOOD OF A FALSE CLAIM LIKE THIS BEING BELIEVED IS VERY LOW\n\nIt is exceptionally rare for followers of a religious leader to claim that he rose bodily from the dead, if only because false claims of this sort are easily debunked.\n\nEdit 3:) For those harping on my suggestion that such a belief could be grounds for insanity. The Catholic Church has summarily executed millions for not adhering to their beliefs. Im not going act as if I’m the monster here, unless you are willing to acknowledge the monstrosity of the church.\n\nEdit 4:) A likely fruitless attempt to link the article. (I’m not very technologically savvy)\n\n[article Im referring to](https://faculty.som.yale.edu/jameschoi/whychrist/)\n\nLet me know if it works!",

Not only opinions, but factual information is routinely censored, and users are banned, if they do not fit ideological/political goals of a particular group (whether its a nation, left/right, subculture, etc - different groups). This encourages everything from ethnic conflicts, to keeping dictators in power - have in mind that Reddit is ranked #18 globally, and has an impact on international policy.  \n\n\nFurthermore, mods that are complacent with Reddit's shitty leadership (I applaud those that are not) are contributing to morally reprehensible outcomes (e.g. loss of 3rd party apps for visually impaired); there should be a system for users to replace such mods.   \n\n\nFinally, having a system in place like this would ensure the mods are incentivized to do a better job, as they could be easily replaceable, every single day.  \n\n\nChange my mind.",

  "title": "CMV: American progressives should stop calling themselves \"democratic socialists\"",
  "selftext": "A decent number of left-wing political figures have gained prominence and influence in American politics over the last few years. Some of the most notable include Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Cori Bush. They represent a growing progressive wing in the Democratic Party that has flexed some weight by pushing Joe Biden to the left during his presidency. However, while they are making decent gains, the left-flank of the party has effectively shot itself in the foot by proudly embracing the label of democratic socialist.\n\nAll of the aforementioned progressive leaders have self-described as democratic socialists. This is dumb for many reasons, but by far the biggest reason is because it's not even accurate to their political or economic positions. Democratic socialism is, before anything else, a form of socialism. It entails a fundamental overthrow of a capitalist free-market economy, putting the the workers in control of the means of production. But the high-profile progressives who so readily adopt the label don't even remotely advocate for that. Their primary agenda includes an expansion to the US social safety net, adding programs such as Medicare for All, free public college, and universal childcare. They also support a $15 minimum wage, a Green New Deal, and a more equitable tax system. None of those policies constitute socialism, democratic or otherwise, by any stretch of the imagination. On the contrary, many of those programs and policies are already commonplace in the vast majority of market-based liberal democracies. The so-called democratic socialist elected officials are very clearly social democrats, a system that maintains a market-economy but places a heavy emphasis on things like social welfare, economic regulations, and worker protections. This is the system that the Nordic countries follow. The fact that Bernie frequently points to Nordic countries as a model to emulate further drives home the fact that he is a social democrat, not a democratic socialist. \n\nThe next problem with their erroneous self-designation is that it completely alienates wide swaths of voters right off the bat. I'm not saying it's right, but millions of Americans view socialism as an instant deal-breaker, and that includes Democrats. Progressives lose out on numerous potential supporters when they proudly claim the mantle of democratic socialism. The worst part is that the progressive agenda is highly popular according to polling, with many of its most important proposals garnering well over majority support among the American public. If Bernie and the others ran on the exact same policies but argued that they were common-sense reforms to our current system that most of the developed world takes for granted rather than a revolutionary socialistic vision, I sincerely believe we would be in a very different place right now.\n\nFor those reasons, I strongly believe progressive political leaders should ditch the democratic socialist label once and for all. Unfortunately, they've been associated with the label for so long that winning over skeptical voters might be a lost cause. In that case, I hope the next slate of progressive politicians who enter the political arena will build on the work of their predecessors and broadly embrace their agenda while completely reworking the messaging around it.\n\nI'd love to hear any contradictory opinions. Thanks!",

  "title": "CMV: It is not better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all",
  "selftext": "They say \"it is better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all.\" I simply believe this isn't true. Love is not a constant. It can be broken in less than a millisecond and years of love can be completely broken and forgotten. All the time you have invested in love and all of the work you put in can be stripped away in a complete instant and you will be left alone. To have loved for a significant amount of time and for it to be robbed from you means that it never really existed in the capacity that you believed it did and it was merely an illusion. Love isn't really real, it's more of a construct to help us continue pushing forward until you're left with nothing. You are much better off to continue the way you are now than to fall in love and have momentary happiness for it to end and be left worse than you were before. \n\nA 6 year long investment of a relationship that ended in complete and utter betrayal was one of the biggest wastes of time in my entire life. I gave every last bit of love to someone who, in the end, would become my worst enemy. I had my reservations even before entering this relationship because I was afraid of getting hurt. After years I let my guard down and I allowed myself to believe that love existed and it would last forever. Now that it is over, I am left with nothing. I wake up believing everything was my fault even though I was the one betrayed. I would have been so much better off and happier having not entering this relationship at all. I guess the title of this post should be more akin to \"love doesn't exist\" but I hold onto hope that there are some people in this world that find true love, but that is few and far between. For the rest of us, wasting time and energy loving others is useless. You are better off focusing on every other aspect of your life than deciding to give your all to another. I don't know if you'll be able to change my mind, but I at least hope that I can see others' perspective on the matter.\n\nEdit: \nMost of you are right. There is much more love in this world than the love for a significant other. It's not right to place all the love in the entire world in the palms of one person. While I feel as though betrayal stings every single day and the pain never really leaves, the love for others, friends, family, aren't diminished by the hands of one or two other people. It's not fair to give up on love when there are so many other aspects of love to give in the universe.",

In my opinion, the Christmas setting of Die Hard is purely window dressing. Yes, the plot hinges on an office party that could only happen at Christmas, but that's just the setup and isn't relevant to the core theme of DH: a lone hero who's an ordinary man in the wrong place at the wrong time unexpectedly overcoming a dangerous threats through the power of sheer bravery and gumption - linking that part of the story to Christmas is honestly pretty weak and an argument made from a place of *wanting* Die Hard to be a Christmas movie, rather than a sincerely \"researched\" conclusion.\n\nKeep in mind when you disagree with me, it's not the people who don't take this seriously and just think this is a bit of fun that I'm annoyed by - you do you.

  "selftext": "Let's look at the 2016 election as an example:\n\nThere is *no way* that a Republican version of Hillary Clinton (imagine, say, someone straight-laced like Robert Gates or Mitt Romney, or someone highly experienced as a senator and SecState) would have lost to a Democratic version of Donald Trump (imagine some Rosie O'Donnell type of liberal candidate who said \"Fuck all Christians, feed them to the lions,\" and said \"grab men by the dick,\" described lesbian sex adventures proudly in graphic detail, sang the praises of Chairman Mao and Pol Pot, talked about how rural voters should be put into Auschwitz-type death camps, said straight people should be forced to be gay, etc.) **No way.** Such a Republican would have crushed the Democratic Trump, maybe something like 400 electoral votes to 138. Landslide.\n\nEven Hillary herself complained during a speech in 2016, \"Why am I not 50 (percentage) points ahead?\"\n\nBut instead, Hillary lost to Trump - by a narrow margin, but a defeat nonetheless.\n\nNow let's fast-forward to 2020. There is **no way** that a Democratic president who was the liberal version of Trump - having uttered 13,000 documented lies, having bungled the handling of a pandemic and gotten half a million Americans killed as a result, a wrecked economy, publicly adored Kim Jong Un, Putin, Xi, Assad and other tyrants, would get anywhere *near* a Republican challenger. Such a Democratic incumbent would - again - be **demolished**. But.....in real life, Trump performed astonishingly well in 2020, considering the circumstances, and was actually just *a few stadiums' capacity of voters* away from winning reelection, had he gotten just a bit more votes in swing states. A lot of people don't realize just how close Trump came to defeating Biden in 2020.\n\nAnd the amount of outrage that Trump received for his gaffes was way lower compared to what a Democrat would have gotten, on a per-gaffe basis. Can you imagine how Republicans would have reacted if Obama had said, \"The continental army captured the **airports** during the Revolutionary War,\" for instance?\n\nMy point isn't to make this a Trump thread - I don't want this to be all about Trump. But my point is that, in general, conservatives over-perform and liberals under-perform - in the context of their resources and advantages.\n\nI could list many more examples of Democrats underperforming compared to how they *ought* to perform, but I don't want this to become a 10,000-word thread OP. Liberals have the media advantage, the numbers advantage (there are 20 million more registered D's than R's in the nation,) the youth advantage, the education advantage, but don't **win** like it at all.\n\nSimply put, liberals are the equivalent of an NFL football team that has 15 Pro Bowlers on their roster, yet do no better in the playoffs than the conservative team that has only 2 Pro Bowlers - in fact, at times performing even *worse*.\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "One argument for the Second Amendment is that it is used to protect against government overreach. Correlation implies otherwise: the US has more guns than our peer countries but we also have more people imprisoned and killed by the government. Police in the US have more impunity to search, detain, and use force than peer countries. By peer countries, I mean high income, Democratic countries including Western Europe, the anglosphere, Japan... I'm sure there's more. \n\nI believe this is causative. In other countries, there is little worry that police at a traffic stop or serving a warrant will be faced with a gun. Many countries don't arm patrol officers, and those countries have fewer police killed on duty. \n\nAs a result of the real threat faced by police, they are increasingly heavily armed. They are quick to use escalating force out of a sense of personal safety. The US courts have protected these police powers.\n\nThe idea I've seen is that if police try to infringe on rights, the gun will save you. It will not. The police will kill you, and then use your death as reason to limit rights to be free of search and seizure and free from government violence.",

  "title": "CMV: Arranged marriages with the option to say no leads to better outcomes for both parties than bar dating where you just hope to randomly meet someone",
  "selftext": "Specifically thinking of the US for this post.\n\nDating in the western world basically boils down to meeting randomly. The most common stereotype is that a man sees a random woman he finds physically attractive at a bar, and approaches her with pick up lines. Not a great system.\n\nThis may be stereotypical, but it’s not far off. The most common advice on Reddit is simply “do lots of social events, and hopefully at some point maybe you’ll just randomly hit it off with someone.” Aka, the bar stereotype, with extra steps. So it’s more than a stereotype. And I’ll be referring to western dating as bar dating from now on in this post. \n\nI’m arguing that bar dating leads to worse outcomes in the long term, vs a system of arranged marriage where your family has come to some agreement with another family. You’re not forced to go with it, but it provides a baseline option for courtship that allows you to skip the chaotic randomness of bar dating if you so choose. \n\nThis default option also better ensures that- your families will get along, and you’ll likely share similar values from aforementioned families that raised you having some mutual understandings. Any kids you may have will benefit from having a large, cohesive family rather than just whatever the randomizer came up with. It’s my firm belief that family cohesiveness is not considered a big factor in bar dating, or it’s resulting relationships, and that people don’t put enough consideration on it unless it’s something considered by older people in the family who know how important it really is. Not having a family network sucks. Learned that one the hard way. \n\nWith bar dating, you’re beholden to physical attractiveness first and foremost, something that is not as important for a long-term relationship. Dating apps take this issue and amplify it further. Arranged marriage is about family values. What is a better foundation for “love”? A major reason for the stunningly higher divorce rates in the west than most of the world is diverging values, I.e. financial ones, philosophical ones, or even something as petty as losing sexual attraction to someone and starting to fantasize about someone else. \n\nSome common retorts to my argument I anticipate and will address here- \n\n1. “What if you have different values than your family”- this is possible, but I’d say most people share at least a majority of their values with their family, hence the surprising consistency of how different geographies in the US vote. Assuming 1/4 people diverge from the base level values of their family, they always have that option to reject the courtship selected to them by their family. \n\n2. “Building a big friend network that will eventually try to set you up is also a common recommendation on Reddit” - I see this as just a worse arranged marriage system. Friends come and go, it’s just how life works. You only get 1 family and they stay with you for your whole life. They raise you. Your random group of friends that you got from randomly meeting people who you had fun hanging out with is not what you should rely on for something like further building out your personal family.",

  "selftext": "About a week ago [I made a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/17o9tyn/cmv_there_is_no_good_side_in_the_israel_palestine/) about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict where I said that I could not find a “good side”.  It got quite a bit of attention, and I awarded a few deltas to people who pointed out that innocent civilians that want to live in peace are “the good side”.  That was a huge oversight on my part when I was making the post. \n\n\r  \nBut, I got a lot of replies from partisans of either belligerent party who did not change my mind at all.  These people are utterly convinced of their own righteousness and the necessity of violence in defense against an existential threat to their chosen side.  I will include a few particularly illustrative quotes below.  \n\n\r  \nReading through these and hundreds of others like them led me to the following conclusion.  This conflict will end in one of two ways:  a bad way, where one of the sides totally annihilates the other, or a good way, where the two peoples live in peace in one state with equal rights for both.  I do not believe that a so-called “two state solution” will work.  If it was going to work, it would have by now and I think, we have reached a situation where each side sees the neighboring state as an intolerable threat to their future.  They both want the same land.  One will have to leave, or they both will learn to share.  There is no other way.  \n\n\r  \nI will now lay out the reasoning behind my point of view. \r  \n\r  \nThe Bad Way:\r  \nI’m convinced there are a lot of people who are using the perceived threat of genocide as a means to gear up for an actual genocide.  I would be happy to just dismiss these people as frustrated cranks but, unfortunately the facts on the ground for the past several decades would suggest that the views below actually hold sway with the political and military leaders of both Israel and Palestine.  \r  \nHere are a few of the most telling quotes I collected from people who support the Israeli side (Note: making some edits in spelling and punctuation for clarity):\n\n\r  \n“Until the Arabs in the Gaza Strip love their children more than they hate Israel, there will be no peace in the middle east.”\n\n\r  \n“Gazans celebrate death.\r  \nIsraelis celebrate life.”\r  \n\r  \n“the majority of the Arabs in Gaza are supportive of the destruction of Israel as a state and the Jews as a people.”\n\n\r  \nAnd here are the partisans of the Palestinians, using very similar language:\n\n\r  \n“The good side is the Palestinian people, in all forms. They are being wiped out to have their homeland stolen, and all forms of their resistance to that are self-defense and completely justified.” \n\n\r  \n“No one in Israel is a civilian. They're entire way of life is based on the extermination of the Palestinian people and it was designed that way from the start. Israel has been consistently murdering, raping, and imprisoning innocent Palestinians for decades.”\n\n\r  \n“I have no doubt that there are many people in Israel that are not pro-Netanyahu but they are benefiting from the occupation of Palestine.  It is ridiculous to suggest that most of the population is innocent when this has been going on for 75 years.”\r  \n\r  \nIs it possible to take any of the statements above at face value and not think massacre is justified?\r  \nI mean, if you were a Jew living in Israel and you earnestly believed that the majority of the population in Gaza supports the destruction of your state and your people, would you be comfortable with having them as your neighbors?  Would it occur to you that destroying the population of Gaza is reasonable given the extreme threat that they pose to your existence?\n\n\r  \nAnd if you were a Palestinian who accepts that the entire way of life of Israelis is predicated on the murder, rape and imprisonment of your brethren, would you be ready to acquiesce into any kind of agreement with the leaders of Israel?  Or would you be ready to commit acts of horrifying brutality in order to avenge the injustices of the past and to build a safer future for your people?\n\n\r  \nIt’s worth pointing out that these are just the views of a few people on Reddit who likely have never been to Israel or Palestine.   So, can you imagine how much more convincing such arguments must be to people who have actually lost loved ones or who have been permanently injured or who have been unjustly imprisoned in the conflict?  Do you think that such people will be supportive of compromises with their adversaries to reach an equitable two state solution or do you think that they might be ready to commit a few war crimes?\r  \n\r  \nThe Good Way\r  \nEverything I wrote up there is super depressing.  And unfortunately, the likely future for the beleaguered region is even more terrorism and brutality.  But, I want to say that there is another way, however, unlikely it may be, and that way is to learn to live together in peace.  It’s not that hard when you think about it.  Two people want to occupy one land.  So just share, right? \n\n\r  \nThe blueprint for how this would work is South Africa which managed to transition from an apartheid scenario where the descendants of a settler population willingly gave up their status as a privileged minority and agreed to end the system where non-whites had less rights.  The black and colored population accepted this agreement without violence or retribution.  In order for this to work in the Holy Land, however, a few things would need to happen:\n\n\r  \n1.\tRecognize the right of all parties to live on the land as they wish – This means equal votes for all with some kind of parliamentary system but also rights for all.  So, no legal oppression of LGTBQ or women allowed.  But also the right of religious conservatives, be they Muslim, Christian or Jewish, to preach tradition. \n\n\r  \n2.\tShared control of police and military – Obviously there has to be buy in from both sides in the security organs if this is to work. \n\n\r  \n3.\tNo more “What abouts?” – If there is one thing that I noticed from my earlier post, it is that partisans of either side are unwilling to recognize the feelings of the other.  So, if you bring up the October 7 attacks to Palestinian supporters they will say, “But what about the decades of apartheid?”, if you bring up the massive civilian deaths in Gaza to Israeli partisans you get, “What about October 7?”  This needs to stop.  Probably a national Truth and Reconciliation Commission should be created so that all parties can air their pain and suffering in a public forum attended by all. \n\n\r  \n4.\tNo more revenge – This is the hardest part.  For this plan to work, it’s going to mean that people will have to say, “I know that I’m not going to get justice for the death of my father”.  This is extremely difficult and completely counter to human nature.  But I firmly believe that it is the only path forward. \n\n\r  \nSo, there we go.  Those are my two recipes for peace in the Middle East.  One is a path of brutality and murder, the other tolerance and understanding.  I wish I could say that I have hope for the latter, but I’m seeing a lot more popular support for the former.  \n\n\r  \nChange my view. \r  \n \r  \n",

  "title": "CMV: Feminism is Good. Feminism is Unstoppable",
  "selftext": "I've seen a lot of posts on this sub and on Reddit overall that suggest that feminism is in some way to blame for a lot of society's ills.  I think that this is nonsense.  I think that if you respect women as full human beings, you have to see feminism as one of the greatest forces for good in the modern era.  \n\nHowever, I also think that the reasons for the rise of feminism have nothing to do with morality and everything to do with technological progress and urbanization and, barring some kind of massive global catastrophe and collapse of civilization, feminism is here to stay whether you like it or not.  Please allow me to explain. \n\n**Feminism is good -** \n\nFor the vast majority of recorded history, which is to say, since the advent of agriculture, women have had far lower social status than men.  The extent of oppression varies across space and time but I know of no exceptions to this in world history.  Women have been married off to husbands against their will, subject to appalling abuse with little to no legal recourse against their spouses and parents, barred from owning property, shamed for any expression of their sexuality and ostracized when they dared to deviate from social norms.  \n\nThere were women in the preindustrial era who rose to great power due to the accident of inheritance (Elizabeth I, Catherine the Great) but they are very much the exception.  And pretty much all authors, scientists, painters, philosophers, theologians, doctors, lawyers sculptors, composers, and anyone whose central life achievement took place outside the home, was a man until about roughly 1800.  \n\nFeminism has a number of varieties but I think we can say over all, the central message is that the situation I described above should cease to exist and women should enjoy equal legal rights and social  respect  as their male counterparts. I think that if you don't agree with this statement who either hate women or you do not see them as fully human.  \n\nYes, individual feminists can be obnoxious and sanctimonious and yes, it's probably slightly more difficult for a heterosexual male to find a sexual partner since the advent of feminism but, so what?  These problems are meaningless in comparison to what women have endured for centuries. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Feminism is unstoppable -** \n\nSo, I'm not going to pull out a bunch of sources and stuff, I'm just writing off the cuff, but I'm going to say that the first inklings of the modern feminist movement started in about 1800 which coincides with the Industrial Revolution.  And herein lies the why of feminism.   Women began to effectively challenge their status as second class beings at exactly the point that people began to migrate from the countryside to cities, from an agricultural life of living off the land to an industrial life of working at a job for money.  \n\nThis makes perfect sense when you stop to think about it.  Women make babies.   Today, in our modern world, babies are a luxury. but in a premodern rural society children are a necessity for the survival of the family and of the community.  More children equals more work in the fields, more people to look after the old folks (remember there was no social safety net in the preindustrial era). People needed to have kids. \n\nAnd having kids was no simple matter in those days.  It was the leading cause of death for women and roughly half of babies born did not see adulthood.  Therefore, women had to spend most of their youth pregnant (which was dangerous) or raising children (very time consuming), both of which take a tremendous toll of a person's physical and mental well-being.  This was not fair and not just but it was endured because it was really the only way for communities and society at large to perpetuate itself and stave off starvation.  \n\nAll of this has now changed since the rise of industry, working for money and an urban based lifestyle.  Children are no longer needed, they are, in fact, a burden on one's household and one's budget.  People still do want kids because they are a great joy and a biological imperative but today people \"decide when they are ready\" to have kids and some people choose never to have them at all.  \n\nThis is a tremendous shift in the fabric of society and it has made it possible for women to realize their full potential as pregnancy can now be put off indefinitely.  Women can focus on developing themselves emotionally, intellectually and professionally.  Moreover, as there are less and less jobs which require brute physical strength, women are effectively able to compete with men in the job market and to excel in the arts, sciences, medicine, business, government, law, etc.  \n\nThis development is the inevitable outgrowth of our modern technological society and barring a complete breakdown in our modern system where we have to return to agrarianism (which is not unthinkable), feminism is here to stay.  \n\nChange my view. \n\n ",

  "title": "CMV: Developed countries' dropping fertility rates will require radical solutions",
  "selftext": "In countries like my own Hungary, but also  (pre-war)Ukraine, Russia, Jamaica, Thailand, etc., dropping birth rates are often blamed on general poverty, and people being unable to afford children that they otherwise say they want.\n\nIn relatively wealthy countries like Japan and South Korea, it is blamed on the peculiarities of toxic work culture, and outstanding sexism against mothers in the workforce.   \n\nIn other wealthy countries without all that, such as the US, it is blamed on the lack of social support system for childrearing for the working class.\n\nIn countries that are wealthy social democracies with solid worker rights and feminist advocacy, such as Norway.... Well, you still hear pretty much all of these arguments for why the birth rate is similarly well under 2.0 same as in all others. \n\nThe simple truth is, that *most people don't want children*. They might say otherwise, but no matter how wealthy a country is, people will always feel nervous about the financial bite of childrearing, not to mention the time and energy that it will always cost, no matter how supportive the system is.\n\nNo matter how well off you are, there will always be a motive to say \"Oh, I would totally love children, they are so cute, but in these times...\" and then gesture vaguely at the window. \n\nAt the end of the day, the one thing that consistently led to low fertility rates is not poverty, or bad social policy, nor sexism, on the contrary: women in developed countries having the option not to get pregnant. \n\nWe obviously don't want to see a reversal of *that*. But in that case, the only other remaining alternative is to inventivize women to have more children. Not with half-assed social policies, but by calculating the actual opportunity cost of  raising a child, and paying women more than that for it. \n\nIf childrearing has a value (and it obviously does for a country that doesn't plan to utterly disappear), then the only way for a society to remain civilized and feminist while getting that value out of women, is to stop expecting childrearing as some sort of honorable sacrifice, and put such a price point on it, that enough reasonably self-interested women would see it as a viable life path. \n\nIn my mind this looks like a woman being able to afford an above-median quality of life (not just for her childbearing years), if willing to give birth to and raise  6-10 children, (and that's still assuming that most women in the world would not take up the offer and have 0 children so that needs to be offset). But the exact numbers are debatable. Either way this would inevitably put a massive financial burden on the segment of society who are not having children. \n\nNote that this is not about the optimal world population: You might believe that we need only 3 billion people to stay sustainable, or that we need 20 billion for a more vibrant society, but either way  that should be a stable population, and I don't see how we are ever going to be getting that in the current system where we are expecting pregnancies to just happen on their own, while we are allowing women the tools to not let them happen, and putting the burden on them if it does.    \n\n Also note that this is not about any particular country's demograpics that immigration can offset, but about the long term global trends that can be expected the current sources of immigration, as well.",

  "selftext": "I (F25) think pregnancy is the scariest thing in the world. I don't remember exactly when/how my fear began but for as far as I can remember I have held this view. In high school, I started having nightmares about being pregnant. They would always feel so real that when I'd wake up, I would grab my stomach to make sure there wasn't a bump there and to make sure it was just a dream. The nightmares never stopped; I probably have one every 3-6 months.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I've always imagined my future family with kids. I've always wanted kids. I just have never seen myself giving birth to them. I'll have dreams that I have little kids and they are always so nice. So, I know it's not a parenthood fear, but specifically a pregnancy fear. I have friends that have always wanted to be pregnant, \"can't wait\" to be pregnant, joke about guys impregnating them. I just cannot wrap my mind around this. I can understand being unable to wait to have kids and have a little mini-me, but how do people get excited about pregnancy?\r  \n\r  \nWhen I think of pregnancy, I think of:\r  \n\r  \nMorning sickness\r  \n\r  \npregnancy nose\r  \n\r  \nGestational diabetes\r  \n\r  \nPreeclampsia\r  \n\r  \nPotential miscarriage\r  \n\r  \nDepression\r  \n\r  \nStretch marks\r  \n\r  \nNot to mention all the complications surrounding the actual birth - tearing, excessive bleeding, hours and hours of pain, etc.\r  \n\r  \nSo, naturally, I've always thought I'd adopt or foster as a way to achieve my envisioned family.

  "selftext": "As I understand it, people with gender dysphoria have an incongruence between one’s sex assigned at birth and one’s gender identity. In other words, the brain feels one way and the body doesn’t match. Therefore, the current treatments that we have modify the body to fit the mind. These surgeries are risky and do not actually result in function similar to that which the brain would like or want to have. For example, someone who’s gender identity is female but was assigned male sex at birth, even if they transition and have gender reassignment surgery, they will not be able to have a baby, they can’t breastfeed, can’t have periods, etc. In some ways, this seems like a patch, but not a fix. A true fix, would be to fix the identity at a brain level. That is, rather than change the body to match the brain, change the brain to match the body. In the future, once we have a better understanding of how the brain works and can actually make that type of modification, it seems like it would make much more sense to do a gender reassignment of the brain, as this is the actual root of the problem. As it stands, giving someone breasts or creating a vagina does nothing to fix the actual issue. Or cutting off someone breasts or penis. These are brutal disfiguring surgeries under any other condition and I think people will look back and be shocked how the medical establishment performed these kinds of procedures during our time. Changing someone’s gender identity to fit their body would allow them to not only feel more “at home” in their body, but it would retain the function of their bodies as well.",

  "selftext": "I’ll start with the main premise: the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not end the war in the Pacific (though they may have been a compounding factor) and did not need to be dropped on Hiroshima, much less Nagasaki. I will obviously expand on this but it’ll probably be best to try and tackle specific points which I can do in the comments. For now, let’s start with some quotes. \n\n**“I voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on **the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary**, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives. **It was my belief that Japan was, at that very moment, seeking some way to surrender with a minimum loss of ’face’.** The Secretary was deeply perturbed by my attitude…”\n- General Dwight Eisenhower, 1963\n\n\"**It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons.\"**\n- Admiral William D. Leahy, 1950\n\n\"’**the first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment.’ The Japanese, he noted, had ‘put out a lot of peace feelers through Russia long before’ the bomb was used.”**\n- Admiral William \"Bull\" Halsey, 1946\n\n“we should have went after the military in Japan. They were bad. **But to drop a bomb on women and children and the elderly, I draw a line there, and I still hold it.\"**\n- Sergeant Joseph O’Donnell \n\n“The war would have been over in two weeks… **The atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all.”**\n- General Curtis LeMay, 1969\n\nThese are some high ranking military figures from the time speaking on the bomb which some of you may find surprising, was controversial since it’s deployment. This of course was because it was used on heavily populated civilian populations without warning intentionally. \n\nIn order to properly discuss the role of the bombs on the Japanese leadership we need to establish a few things. Japan’s official strategy was known as Ketsugo and was essentially a commitment to an armistice. Their goal was to force the US to a conditional surrender through a Vietnam type situation. Essentially their goal was to intercept Downfall (the Allies invasion strategy) and throw as many lives at it as possible. It was a strategy known as “The Glorious Death of One Hundred Million\" by the Japanese. This was because the US issued an unconditional surrender which put the Emperor in jeopardy and they would not budge until the Emperor was secured (hence why it wasn’t until the Byrnes note that the Emperor surrendered and is why he was never tired for war crimes). That point is very important, but only relevant to the bombs in so far as it meant even with them they were planning to face total destruction. Some argue that it was an issue of loss of life, but as many other tend to point out, the Bombing of Tokyo killed just as many if not more civilians and they were planning on total war Vietnam style. The only things the bombs would have successfully done to the Japanese was weaken the strength of their ketsugo strategy in the eyes of the Emperor as they had no means to prevent these attacks. This however did note require a city to be hit. All it would have required was a demonstration, and if that did not work, we could have hit an Arsenal. \n\nIt is not as though this idea was not considered. Both committees (two were made for the bombings) considered pure military targets, Truman wanted military targets, and even other officials like  Marshall sought with a meeting with the Secretary of War to prevent that. This of course went no where. \n\nWhat we should have done was alter the Potsdam Declaration to allow for imperial retention, deploy a tactical/display bombing, slow down the rate of successive bombings and at least originally deploy them on military targets. Furthermore if civilian targets must be hit, doing so after the entry of the USSR would have been preferable. \n\nThere’s a lot I could say on the subject as it is very nuanced so just ask in the comments. I’m very open to discussion.",

  "selftext": "So the common belief is that nukes mean that countries will think twice about attack eachother if they have nukes or are protected by a country with a nuclear arsenal and this is why ww3 won't happen and why we are in an era of unprecedented safety. I sort of disagree. \n\nFirst of the threat of MAD extends beyond direct 1v1 war, the threat of nukes exists to prevent defence of countries being attacked by nuclear powers like what we see in Ukraine. Russia knows we won't risk MAD so won't nuke them for attacking or will back Ukraine with soldiers. If neither the US or Russia had nukes, it is possible Russia wouldn't have attacked maybe they would have gone for a coup but if they attacked instead of a practical 0% chance of nuclear retaliation and an even lower chance of sending soldiers there would be 0% chance of nukes and a high chance of sending direct reinforcements to Ukraine which is much riskier for Russia who can't hide behind MAD.\n\nCass in point: Kosovo, NATO forces directly went into Yugoslavia fo stop the Serbs from genociding, while not an invasion in the typical sense I believe there would be more Kosovos and less Ukraines. Sadly people died in the NATO bombings but a lot less people than would have died if the genocide was allowed to continue.\n\nSo countries would expect more of a retaliation for invading rather than a trivial chance of MAD and some sanctions that dictators don't care about anyway. Reverse could be true for the USA if they invaded but I don't really see any wars they took part in where they could even have been retaliated against bar Korea where the US didn't have ICBMs abd vice versa anyway.\n\nA lot of countries also got nukes as a reaction like Pakistan as a result of India.\nA lot of border wars happened including one after both countries had nukes before too but in the 1971 war there was a genocide in east Pakistan AKA Bangladesh that India got involved in, if Pakistan had nukes imagine how many more Bengalis would have been killed. And this is with Indias extremely corrupt army at that time having lost to the Chinese less than a decade ago one of the poorest countries on earth. \n\nNothing can be done about the many crimes in the USSR and warsaw pact.\n\nYes some wars still would still happen but I believe it would be better for no one to have nukes because even if only the US or UK ect have nukes that will mske other countries want to make nukes of their own or some similar defence or counter measure.\n\nTl;dr: nukes are not the backbone of world peace",

  "title": "CMV: The modern use of \"agnostic/gnostic\" as a modifier to theism/atheism is a bad change to the language, and it's widespread adoption in atheist communities is an example of indocterination, and is intellectually lazy",
  "selftext": "For anyone who doesn't know, there has been a trend in recent years (last couple decades) to separate people's answers to the question of God into two distinct categories, Belief and Knowledge, and that these categories are represented on two separate continums of theist/atheist and gnostic/agnostic.  A theist is a person who believes in God, while an atheist is someone who does not believe in God.  An agnostic is someone who has no knowledge to the existence of God, while a gnostic is someone who does.\n\nSo I'm not going to go too deep into the history of the words, because I believe it to be largely irrelevant.  Words change in time, and those changes can be good or bad.  My issue with the new schema is not that it's new, but that it's worse than the previous one.\n\nThe *only* reason I will bring up the historical use is because the way the words are often explained in atheist communities (like /r/athiesm) is that these are the technical uses of the word, which is simply untrue.  It is a fairly recent development, and isn't really used in academia.  This isn't really an argument against it, just a response to people who seem to believe this is the proper use of the terms.\n\nSo onto my critique of the terms.\n\nI'll start with my strongest critique, it adds ambiguity where none existed before.  Specifically, it lumps together \"lack of belief\" and \"disbelief\" into the same category.  These are not the same things at all.  I'll demonstrate this point real quick.\n\nImagine I said I am going to be eating dinner tonight, and it really could be anything.  I then ask you \"Do you believe I'm having tacos tonight?\".  Well, on what basis would you be formulating your belief here?  I think most people would probably respond with \"I don't know, I have no idea\".  If this was a person's response, does this person reject the notion I'm having tacos tonight?  Of course not, for all they know, I absolutely am.  But they also aren't taking on the belief I'm having tacos tonight, they simply have no actual formulated belief. \n\nIn comparison, if I asked \"Do you believe I'm having dog tacos?\", I think most people (in most places in the world) would respond with \"No, I do not think you are\".  This is an active disbelief in the notion.  \n\nThe positions of belief in these examples are fundamentally different, but in both situations in the paradigm above, they would fall under \"atheist\".  In fact, because you don't actually have knowledge of my dinner, and there isn't anything physically stopping me from having a cat taco other than cultural norms, both would fall under \"agnostic atheist\" in regards to my dinner.  \n\nIn the preferable schema, we would map a lack of belief to agnosticism.  In the above examples, we would be agnostic to tacos, but athesit to dog tacos.\n\nThere have been other terms to express this separation, like strong and weak atheism, negative or positive atheism, etc.  However, these are more common in academic circles and not really used in everyday speech.  Agnostic is used most commonly to express this.  So attempting to use agnostic atheism to express a belief that there is no god, but a lack of knowledge, goes against both academic and layman uses and is really just a niche use in modern atheist circles.\n\nMy next critique is I don't think \"knowledge\" is a really relevant factor when it comes to belief in God.  I don't think anyone has any real knowledge of God, as far as I'm aware. Now, one issue with this argument I'm making is it is *highly* dependant on what definition of God we use, and what we mean by \"knowledge\", but I do believe that what is *actually* being expressed is \"how strong the belief really is\".  \"Gnostic atheists\" do not have any stronger knowledge than \"agnostic atheists\", they are simply more adament in their belief.  They have greater certainty.  Certainty in your belief does not equate knowledge, and I do not see how it is even possible for someone to have actual knowledge on this topic.  All arguments I've heard on this really point to \"I'm pretty certain in this belief\", which I have nothing against, some beliefs you CAN feel pretty certain about.  I'm pretty certain in my belief, for a great number of reasons, that there is not a teacup orbiting Mars, however, I do not have any actual knowledge about the location of all teacups in order to state I have knowledge about it.\n\nTo be even *more* clear, I don't actually object to people using these terms for themselves.  If someone describes themselves as an \"agnostic atheist\", I believe there is ambiguity in that, but I don't really care, there's ambiguity in all terms and if they identify with that one, that's fine.  The issue I take is when they attempt to remove \"agnostic\" from the dialogue entirely as a category a person can identify as, because they claim it isn't a separate category.  I think in order to make this claim, they need to have *some* foundational explanation as to why it's better, and as of yet I've heard none.",

  "selftext": "I get it, you’re already spending seven dollars on a coffee but if you’re doing that you probably have a dollar or two more to spare, however that’s not even my main point.\n\nSo often I hear people saying, “tipping culture has gotten out of hand.” I don’t agree with capitalism or the way we currently treat service workers and agree that businesses should 100% foot the bill to pay employees a living wage. However, that is not the system we currently live under and in the real world today, most service workers do not make a living wage and rely heavily on tips.\n\nHere’s my thing; nobody is making you tip. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But it irks me when people are anti-tip but try to spin it into being a workers rights thing. No, you’re not tipping because you believe employers should pay their workers more and you think they deserve a living wage. You’re not tipping because you simply don’t want too. That’s fine, but don’t try to make it sound like you are some kind of pro-worker amazing person. When you don’t tip a server you are essentially screwing them over in the current system because nobodies rising up to change how restaurants pay them. \n\nI get it more for other businesses but again, nobodies making you tip. I think it’s good that more businesses are offering tip options. Should it be necessary? No. But in the system we live under I think it’s great that there’s an option, option being the key word, for a barista or cashier to make a dollar or two more during a transaction. \n\nIf you feel like it do it, if you don’t then don’t. But when people just outright dismiss tipping as a whole it makes me think you just don’t want to feel guilty for not doing it and you put that higher than the positives it can bring for the worker. I think it’s good in todays system for there to be an option for people to make a little more money.\n\nEdit: I’m not saying people who don’t tip don’t actually care about workers rights but choosing to not tip a service person seems like an odd way of showing support. I get the idea in theory but let’s be honest, the tipping system isn’t changing anytime soon and you not doing it is not making some big statement to big business it’s just not giving extra money to a single worker, which is fine if you don’t want too. \n\nI guess it just bugs me that people act like them not tipping is some big act of rebellion against big business, they don’t care and the workers are the ones feeling the brunt.\n\nEdit 2 - I almost put in the US in the title because I figured people would assume since tipping is much more of a thing here than other places but yes, I am specifically talking about the US.",

But even more strange is that corporations are working hard to convince people that this is the reason. \n\nObviously these corporations don’t want to pay employees more than they have to but there is something worse that they don’t want us to realize. These corporations are not raising the prices of their products because of their own employees, but because of everyone else’s employees. \n\nAs wages increase, so does demand for many products. So companies need to decide if they should increase supply to match this demand. But they can just as easily increase prices to reduce demand. They make more money, they don’t have to invest in extra infrastructure, and if the increased demand drops in the future they are safe. It’s great for the 1% but it really sucks for everyone else. These businesses get that extra money but it doesn’t trickle down to the employees enough to cover the extra expenses and ultimately reduces the quality of life for many, if not most americans.\n\nYes we need to pay employees more, but we need to fix this corporate greed or it will never improve our economy or quality of life for the average american.",

  "selftext": "There seems to be no interpretation that encompasses what race really seems to be. From what I have seen: race is framed as either a social construct or some rigid taxonomic classification. This seems uninformed, race exists in a social context as all races are constructed from phenotypes. Most phenotypic characteristics that determine race are genetic and correlate w/ ancestry. While you might be able to find all sorts of phenotypes in all races, the race-relevant ones won’t have similar ubiquity as these traits will cluster by race. \r  \n\r  \nOf course, the exact nature of race will be a socially constructed layer. A layer whose application depends on the extent to which differences in ancestry exist in a given population as well as culture-specific forces. Furthermore, social constructs are not random things that random people from centuries ago invent and enforce on the population. They are constructed with reference to objective non-socially constructed things as well as the utility of a concept in a societal context. The objective thing seems to be ancestry and it is mediated by what specific ancestries exist in the social context (e.g. An Arab country might see races as discriminating between local ethnic groups while the same people in, say America, would be seen as Middle Eastern.) \r  \n \r  \nTherefore any societal construction of race will always be identifiable by ancestry given knowledge of the social construction. Given what races exist in a society, a genetic test will be able to tell them apart. I find it very hard to imagine a concept that a genetic test could accurately capture not being biological.\r  \n\r  \nA counter I could see to this would be that the biological things deemed relevant are biological but that the reason they are deemed relevant is from social construction. This seems unconvincing in light of the role of ancestry—which is not socially constructed—because there are no things seen inherent to race that are not ancestral. It may be the case that the importance to a society of one race is socially constructed—think slavery—however, that is just an application of race as a varying of the importance won’t change identification unless the social construction changes.\r  \n\r  \nSo how would one contend that race is not mediated by a genetic ancestral component and if so what other mechanisms would race be constructed around?

  "selftext": "For those unaware, there's been a bit of a debate sparked in recent times over whether or not \"reaction\" channels are harming the viewership of so-called \"original content creators.\" \n\nFor those who are unaware, basically there is an entire genre of YouTube video and Twitch streamer which is devoted to people reacting to someone else's content. \n\nFor example, if I make a video about the \"top 10 craziest events which happened in 1874,\" a \"reaction\" channel may come along and decide to make a video of them giving their reaction to my content for people to watch.\n\nThe argument from people who say these reaction videos are harming content creators is basically that they are detracting from the viewership of the original creator by instead funneling people to \\*their\\* channel. \n\nThis argument seems massively flawed, but first I think we need to divide people who are watching the content in question into two categories: those who are watching for the information itself, and those who are watching for the person presenting/reacting to the formation. \n\nFor those in the former category, I don't see how you could argue that they're being funneled away from the original content, since they're watching the video \\*for the person who is reacting\\*. If the person who is reacting to it had never watched the video, then neither would they, since their interest in the content is secondary to their interest in the reactor. \n\nFor those in the second category, it doesn't make logical sense to suggest that someone who wants to watch my video about 1874 would do so by watching someone else - who is likely pausing the video repeatedly or talking over the top of it - watch the video, when they could just watch the OC in the first place. \n\nIn order to suggest that this person is being dragged away from the OC, you'd have to argue that they were both willing to wait for the reaction video to come out hours or days after the OC, then also watch the video while being interrupted by some random person they don't care about. \n\nThe only scenario I could see is if the person happens to overlap into both categories, and so gets to kill two birds with one stone, but to that I would say that could just as easily be offset by the number of people who discover the content creator through the reaction video and go on to watch the OC along with other videos made by the content creator.

(I'm not talking about an inside cat that accidentally slips outside, mistakes happen), but people who willingly let their cat roam the neighbourhoods at all hours day or night. Cats should be indoors or in a controlled outdoor cat run.\n\nI'm in a lot of community groups and lost and found pet groups and every second post is about someone who's found a cat hit by a car or someone's outdoor cat who \"usually comes home by now\" but has been missing over a week. Always with extremely distressed and stressed owners heartbroken over something that can be completely avoidable if they were just a responsible cat owner.\n\nReasons you shouldn't let your cat free roam:\n\n\\- They can be hit by cars. And they do... a lot. I've personally witnessed this so many times and it's always heartbreaking. And can also be traumatic for the poor driver who was just trying to drive at night while a cat darts in front of their car.\n\n\\- They can get into fights with other cats, lost or stray dogs or wildlife. I've known people who's cats have come home completely bloodied and torn up and yet they \\*still\\* let them out. It just makes no sense to me.\n\n\\- They can ingest poison, bait or a baited animal or something else harmful.\n\n\\- They could wander into someone elses shed or garage and accidentally get locked in without a person knowing. I've heard of dead cats being found weeks after they went missing because they were locked in a shed with no food or water.\n\n\\- They are at a much higher risk of many preventable diseases such as Feline leukemia, feline AIDS, feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), toxoplasmosis, distemper, and rabies can be difficult to detect and, in the case of FIP and distemper, impossible to test for.\n\n\\- You are dramatically limiting their lifespans. Many studies have shown that indoor cats live 10-20 years on average. While the average for outdoor cats is much lower at only 2-7 years. You are literally cutting your pets life short.\n\n\\- There are creepy people out there who hate cats, and harm them by trapping, shooting or hunting them.\n\nAll of this doesn't even take into account the millions of native wildlife cats destroy yearly.\n\nAs a lifelong pet owner and lover I just can't understand why so many people are fine with just not not seeing their animal for sometimes whole days or more at a time, not knowing where they are or what they could be doing. Also knowing just how many bad side effects there are including literally a lowered lifespan I can't understand how anyone who claims to care for their cat would do this.\n\nCats that are given an outdoor run or lots of toys and enrichment indoors live long, happy and fulfilled lives.\n\nAlso, this is coming from someone who has worked at or volunteered at wildlife shelters, dog and cat rescues and adoption centres my whole life. I've seen first hand the damage or free roaming cats literally hundreds of times.\n\nEDIT: To the person in this thread who's argument for letting cats outside was that \"only two\" of your cats have been hit by cars. Thank you for inadvertently showing exactly why people shouldn't let cats out. The fact that you think it's fine and normal that two of your cats have been hit by cars and that you are okay with that is downright insane.",

  "title": "cmv: The idea that it is ‘traditional’ that men worked and women stayed at home is a right wing fantasy.",
  "selftext": " For some reason Instagram thinks I have unresolved issues with my mother and has inundated me with nonsensical whiny propaganda regurgitated by fresh and fit and that genius pearl. And an overriding theme that seems to emanate from their effluence is that women historically stayed at home and photosynthesised while their brave husband went outside empire building or some other rubbish, and that they should go back to being at home and be 'traditional'. I'm going to call this don Quixote syndrome, men with hilarious views on manliness and chivalry tilting at imaginary foes that 'threaten' their precious masculinity. \n\n But let me tell you a couple of three things, first of all the notion that women historically never worked, and that men were the primary breadwinners in society. This is a modern myth and fantasy completely divorced from reality. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS WORKED. Women have for the entirety of the history been engaged in labour and work. In pre industrial agrarian societies both men, women and children were engaged in farming. Subsistence farming without industrial tools is incredibly manpower intensive and the idea you have half the adult population exclusively at home is ridiculous. You can see this even to this day in less developed economies, tea pickers, and hell visit any village in India you will find just as many women in the fields as men, it is literally necessary for survival, particularly in rice growing societies that women also engage in field labour. Now you could say that men did more field work than women in general, ok fine, but that does not denigrate the very real and important labour that women did do to a far greater extent than men. Textiles, spinning and knitting, the clothes on most of humanities backs were manufactured by women, how could a man wield a scythe in summer if his wife didn't the clothes that kept him from freezing in winter??\n\n But moving on from that into the industrial age, literally the very first workers in the new burgeoning factories were women! They worked the spinning jennies, women were at the forefront in the new sectors that opened up in the industrial revolution. The coal mines had entire families working in them, mum, dad , and the kids, not just the men. Gruelling labour that women got paid less than the men for, the children a mere pittance. Women had to work, to bring home money or the entire family would starve, for 99% of people for 99% of history, the mans wages were simply not enough.\n\n  I believe this idea that women are meant to stay at home and only raise kids and do housework really originated with the rise of the middle class. With a tranche of society where men had the luxury of being able to financially take care of multiple dependants. Thanks to this for a few decades, particularly in post WW2 America there was a time where the economic circumstances allowed the culture of a stay at home wife to become prevalent.\n\n But moving on to this other notion that men in the past were all brave heroic adventurers who went of brave overseas conquests. Again another fantasy, sure apart from the maybe few thousand kings and upper nobility that existed in societies for the other 100 billion humans that have existed it was a daily battle for survival. You were tied to your land, your status little more than a slave, unless of course you were a slave. You couldn't read or write, you couldn't leave your land without the lords permission, you'd most likely be pressed into service so your master could gain another bit of land, and if you survived you'd go home a cripple. And the idea that any of you if you were born during the past somehow break free and rise is laughable, social mobility was extremely rare, you try that alpha male andrew tate sigma nonsense as a peasant you'll get your head lopped off by a knight in a heartbeat. While maybe men had it slightly better of than women their position was still pitiable. So you know what if everyone should be traditional then 99% of men should be subservient, and die at aged thirty after getting sepsis from a papercut.",

The slightest mention of any other economic system by the layman would see that person labeled as a pariah rather than them being a part of a larger discussion of how we can maintain our economy.\nWe look to companies to help us determine our self-worth and if we are included/represented in society. We rely on companies like Disney to show representatives of ourselves instead of relying on our own teachings and community to give our children a feeling of pride and belonging in our society. We rely on artists such as Lizzo to be examples or reasons why people who look a certain way should or could be respected and admired instead of doing the real work of analyzing our own biases and working to dismantle the opinions thrust upon us by the same industries that we look to for solutions. We are lost in the sauce. Too deeply ingrained in a frame of thought dominated by opinions of people who only see your participation as a means to profit. We have lost the battle, and there is no turning back. I don't see a way out, and I think we are very cynically attached to companies.\n\n\nEdit: I apologize for not answering most of you. I started receiving really inflammatory and threatening DMs and decided to pull away from this topic. As it turns out, people don't like it when you criticize capitalism. While I was involved, I realized that either there is a strong lack of comprehension in this sub or I constructed my argument poorly. I ultimately decided that I could've explained my point better and will seek to clarify a few things. \nSome thoughts before I get started: I will never use hyperbole in my posts going forward, and neither will I use 1 thing as an example of my point. People seemed to latch on to Disney and Lizzo even though I used them as examples of an artist and a company, but my point applies to multiple artists and companies. Some people seemed really hung up on the fact that they didn't know who lizzo was rather than seeing outside of themselves or thinking of how other artists are perceived by our public. \nOn to the clarity: \n1. It is my feeling that we have allowed ourselves to be brainwashed by marketing. It has been so thoroughly ingrained in us to absorb that marketing that we start to shift our priorities. An old example of this is engagement rings. The advertisement of the De Beer company was so convincing that we have integrated that practice into our relationship culture. Its advertisement predated our decision to spend money we don't have on rocks. This is one example (I have to say that for some people) of how capitalism has shaped our way of thinking.  \n2. Some of our population uses corporate representation of characters, traits, and ideas as a measuring stick for their own representation in America. I'm not saying that it's weird or wrong to want to be properly represented. I'm saying that looking to company's (movie company, record company, etc.) portrayal of a character as anything other than a through-line to get more people to spend money on their products is just wrong. To clarify, I'm not judging children on this. Their parents don't raise them to not see separate themselves from these characters like my family did. To me, this is another example of how advertising has brainwashed a portion of our population. This advertising is part of the way that capitalism has developed in America. \n\nIn conclusion, the Capitalism has worked its way into our value systems. It's next to impossible for any of us to even envision another system. This is evidenced by some of the responses that I received that simply state \"but Capitalism is good and it works\" without any degree of real criticism for the system. You can like something and see the flaws of it. If you cannot see the flaws then in my mind, and this is not hyperbole, you are brainwashed. I hope this clarified some of the things that I said. I didn't write this to dramatically alter my position but to clarify for people who jumped to conclusions and made really unproductive statements. Keep your vitriol in this comment section and out of my dms. Thanks. \n",

  "selftext": "Way too many people go to college compared to what is necessary in the workforce. There are so many jobs which are basically just basic office jobs that most semi-competent high school graduates could do if companies would consider hiring them. However since there are so many people with degrees they can get away with hiring college graduates into these low-tier corporate jobs that are barely or not enough to make the degree worth it. Most liberal arts/English/ect are largely unnecessary to whatever job they will eventually go into. Unless someone is extremely interested in learning the content of the major, the cost is not worth it, except the job landscape has made unnecessary degrees basically required.\n\nIf more people were able to get decent jobs right out of high school this would be incredibly beneficial. It would make getting a degree actually distinguish people again. It would allow people to get decent jobs without large amounts of debt. It would save time for those mostly indifferent to educational pursuits. It would improve classes because a greater percentage of students would be actually interested in their majors rather than just giving because it was the default. College obviously has an important place, but right now it is overgrown to everyone(but companies) benefit.\n\nIf the government stoped over encouraging people into higher education and offered some sort of incentive to companies to hire high school graduates into decent positions that don’t really need degrees it would only need to be a temporary cost, and would probably cost a lot less than making college mostly free or some other solution to balance people’s debt to job prospects after leaving college.",

I used to think that only Kenya's politicians use ethnicity to get votes and I was surprised to see that even in liberal democracies like the U.S. and Germany there are these types of politicians.\n\nFor example in the U.S there is a lot of talk about the black vote, hispanic vote and the evangelical vote, the white vote e.t.c. \n\nThe school I went to in Nairobi (the capital city) was multi-ethnic/multi-religious meaning I interacted a lot with people from different faiths, people who spoke different languages from mine and people who had different cultural practices. My best friend was from a different ethnicity, and when I was in university I even dated a muslim girl. \n\nBy the time I became an adult I had already accepted that people were the same even though they looked different, had different beliefs and culture, and I am not the only one, most people that went to the same type of schools that I did, ended up having the same world view. Such that Politicians who use tribalism to get votes had a hard time getting votes from us. \n\nThis is however not the case for all people in my country, lots of people went to school in less diverse places and these people are duped by politicians a lot in to voting against their own interest.\n\nNow back to the west, let's take the US for example some white voters vote for Republicans even though they would be better served by democrats e.g in terms of minimum wage, greater access to health care benefits and good working conditions all because of race based issues.",

Some people will say \"I wouldn't wish depression on my worst enemy\". I digress. I would wish it on certain people if I was absolutely sure it would change them for the better or get them to listen to a perspective they didn't care existed previously. Alright rant over.\n\nAnyways back to depression.\n\n* Antidepressants. You call that a cure? it's so expensive and dangerous to be on for the long term. So many  side effects. Prevention is better than cure.\n* Therapy. Boy do I hate therapy, not only do you fork out $100-300 per session, as you notice your wallet is getting light, then your bank balance. Then you realise just having one good friend could pretty much give you the same value as most therapists.\n   * Whats teh need for therapists? oh right if you don't have an internet connection and can't be arsed to help yourself, if you want someone to complain to, seems the only real utility left is that.  Because you pay them to complain to them, not really worth it unless it's a secret that you'll never tell anyone but need to.\n* Curing trauma is not as easy as \"get help\" \"you need therapy\". Most mental trauma is never fully cured and can always pop up again from memory, even despite talking it out, taking drugs, getting various treaments. Depression specifically changes the way your brain is structured, and the size of the hippocampus shrinks IIRC. This is not something that drugs or talk therapy can ever hope to cure with such pointless bandaid fixes. Which is further why the entire field of psychology and medicine needs to be rewritten in order to accommodate and be ready to correctly treat the increasing trend of mental illness. But as it remains there's little hope for a cure. And \"take these meds daily for the rest of your life to be cured\" is a slippery slope of \"when will I forget to take them, not if.\" Because it **will** happen and all the suicidal etc thoughts come right back with a venegance.\n\nThe cure to mental illness seems to be to never get ill. Our top scientists and psychologists etc don't actually have anything worth a damn to beat prevention. Dismal.\n\n# Edit: I'd like to make a distinction. When I talk about depression here, I do mean clinical depression. It's been pointed out that the two are different, so as to avoid confusion, for the sake of this CMV, we'll stick to clinical depression as the one we want to prevent.",

  "title": "CMV: the legal drinking age of 21 is fine where it is",
  "selftext": "A common argument for lowering the drinking age to 18 that I see so often is \"but literally every country other than US has a drinking age of 18 or lower, US is such an anomaly,\" well you get my idea. well, this might be a little of an extreme comparison, but if everyone else jumped off a bridge, does that mean you should do it too? In other words, this is merely an appeal to the majority, which is a logical fallacy and doesn't really do anything to actually advance the argument of a lower drinking age. Why should the \"majority opinion\" always necessarily be correct? Also, a handful/sizeable portion of other countries also set their drinking/smoking ages at 21, so it's not just the US. \n\nAnother very common argument for lowering the drinking age is \"well you can die for your country, vote, sign contracts, etc. etc. at 18, so why can't you have a beer too at that age?\" Well, this is a flawed argument since if you even know a bit about American history, you'd know that literally all of the other \"adult\" rights at 18 came from the fact that we were sending 18 year olds to fight in the Vietnam war and felt bad that they still weren't considered adults. This was the catalyst that set off the 26th amendment that made the voting age 18 which effectively caused a chain reaction and made the legal age of majority/\"adulthood\" to be 18 in most states (which gave immature teenagers rights to own guns, marry, and everything else). If we only were smart enough to only draft people above 21 (which I don't really see why not, other than maybe high school to military is a clean transition, since 21 year olds are still very physically able and probably are more experienced/knowledgeable with making quick crucial decisions) who had the capacity to make the decision for themselves to die in war, guess what? The \"age of adulthood\" would've stayed at 21 across the board and no one would be even bringing up this argument.  \n\nThe argument of \"but a drinking age of 21 will make drinking riskier for 18-20 year olds since they will have to break the law and get illegal alcohol, which might be unsafe\" is a shitty one as well since alcohol should be illegal for under 21s to begin with and that just points to (relatively speaking) trivial issues of practical enforcement which we indeed are improving on over time. \n\nScientifically speaking, the human brain, especially the parts that process making rational decisions (which are exactly the cognitive functions inhibited by alcohol consumption), doesn't finish developing until around 25, so at least 21 as a cutoff is much more reasonable than letting people who are barely out of high school drink (or more generally, consider them as \"legal adults\". yes, I get that people married at 14 back in the 1800s but that was a much different culture back then and even then it was more for practical reasons like stability rather than having moral justifications), as enforcing a 25 cutoff would be impractical and rather draconian. Alcohol can easily become addictive and lead to a slippery slope of addiction, so it's important to nip that in the bud for people in the 18-20 age range. Some practical arguments also exist: setting 21 as the legal age would prevent 18-20 year old kids to distribute alcohol to their high school aged peers. I don't get why so many people aged 18-20 are complaining about the alcohol laws, there are millions of ways to have fun and enjoy yourself without having to involve alcohol in the picture, such as reading a book, skating, seeing a movie with friends, the list goes on. \n\nAlso, if you're gonna assume I'm a conservative by this post, well, I'm by no means one, I'm largely neutral and mostly just go by what makes logical sense to me. It's just that the two or three main arguments for lowering the drinking age to 18 don't really make sense under closer scrutinization, and given that adolescence often extends to the early 20s, an drinking age of 21 definitely makes more sense than 18. \n\n&#x200B;",

Why would you be proud of this genetic lottery? You wouldn't be proud of being born in a certain hospital building right? \"Fuck yeah, I was born at John Hopkins!\". You’d be laughed at if you said that because it’s illogical and strange.\n\nSecond, most first-world countries have a history of conflict and war crimes. In America, there existed centuries of slavery, genocide against Native Americans, segregation, lynchings, etc. Obviously, no one who is alive today participated in those things. But these were policies perpetuated by our government and under our constitution (the very same constitution we are currently operating under). No one should feel shame for those act since no one alive today carried out those acts (except for segregation as people from that era are still alive). But we wouldn't feel pride either right?\n\nOftentimes you will hear conservatives say that we shouldn’t feel shame about slavery because it was in the past. So if we shouldn’t feel shame about our past mistakes, we shouldn’t feel pride for our past accomplishment either right? And even if you did contribute to those things indirectly (taxation funding NASA), it's not like you CHOSE for your money to go to the funding of space exploration. Your money went there because our (largely-undemocratic) government said it should go there.\n\nWhat about the good things \"we've\" done. Moon landing, spreading democracy (very arguable), stopped fascism in Europe. No one alive did any of those things (unless you are a WWII veteran). \"We\" didn't land on the moon. Engineers and astronauts worked for that to happen. They are entitled to feel pride because they accomplished that. Why should the rest of the country feel proud? I was born 30 years after that happened. Why should I feel proud about that? I didn't contribute to any of those things.\n\nBeing proud of personal accomplishments is perfectly logical, but being proud of something simply because someone in your country did that? It makes no sense.\n\n Let's say I lived in an apartment complex called \"Oak Forest Apartments\". Then I hit up my city hall records office and found out that 20 years ago, a gold medal olympian lived in my exact apartment. Would it make sense for me to say “Oak Forest fuck yeah! Oak Forest pride! Oak Forest pride! All Oak Forest Apartment residents are Olympians”. I would be ridiculed if I did that. How is national patriotism different? These are arbritrary geographic lines.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand why people are patriotic. We are prone to all kinds of illogical behavior.

  "selftext": "\"Who would win a fight\" is question asked all the time in different fandoms and is mostly answered using \"power scaling\". Basic principle is as following. Consume all possible media the character is portrait and take their best performance or \"feats\" and then use transitive relation and compere them to other characters in said media. This gives you some sort of power tier and now you start heated argument with someone about how this character could win that character in a fight. That is power scaling in a nutshell.\n\nThis kind of discussions always devolve into fandoms arguing about pointless and misguided interoperations of these characters and stories they are in. If you ask same question in two different subreddit you can guess the concusses winner just from subreddit name alone. Your favorite character will always win and my main argument tells why this is actually always correct.\n\nFirst some minor arguments why this is pointless before the actual main argument.\n\n* **Taking only the extreme feats.** Characters power level is not same their strongest feat. Sometimes their action is due to luck or it's a last ditch effort. Not something your would even consider using in a actual match up.\n* **Inconsistency within story.** Even within same story written by the same writer, characters power level fluctuates. There is sometimes in world explanation for this and sometimes not.\n* **Inconsistency between stories.** Squirrel Girl have managed to subdue heavy hitters like Galactus and Thanos so clearly she is the most powerful Marvel here out there. In others she is knocked down by a bus. Same character has different feats depending on the story sometimes even losing or gaining abilities depending who is writing it.\n* **Not taking in account flair.** If I write a book and say character is \"fast as a bullet in a boxing ring\" everybody knows I don't mean that they can throw a punch 3000 km per hour. That is figurative speech. And when comic book artist or animator animates a flashy attack where character pulls moon from orbit and uses it to strike a planet they don't actually mean that what happens. It's just flair. There is no consistency with this kind of flair and it doesn't have to have.\n* **Difference in media.** Continuing on the last point written text is not comparable to animation or video game. These are different medias and depiction of same action will appear very differently in all of them.\n* **Impossibility to compere different IPs.** Magic (or power) systems in each IP work differently. Trying to compere magic of Harry Potter to magic in Lord of the Rings is pointless because they are not comparable. This becomes even worse when you try to say \"because this character can absorb chakra in their own universe they should be able to absorb magic mana in other\". That's not how those worlds work.\n* **Fights don't have justification**. This is more about bad writing in part of these debates but characters don't have any motivation to fight each other and therefore these fights are narratively poorly written and boring.\n\nAnd now the actual reason why power scaling is pointless and misguided.\n\n* **Writers can do whatever they want.** [Stan Lee put this the best. Who would win in a fight? Whoever the writer wants to win.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3pOIDaF1Dw]) Writers write compelling and good stories. If they are fun they are fun might that be because of cleaver tactics or flashy animation. Writer can make anyone win any fight and if the story is good it's good. It doesn't matter what characters have done in some other stories or how one is \"supposed to be stronger\".\n\nAnd this is not just \"let's ignore plot armor\" kind of deal. Plot and the story is all that these fictional characters have. They are not real so they have nothing but plot armor and plot weapons. All their feats and actions happen because of the plot and therefore are at whims of the writer.",

  "selftext": "CMV: Capitalism is superior for equal/fair pay.\n\nMy view is that capitalism achieves equal and fair pay generally better than a more regulated economic system like socialism or communism. \n\nI see “equal pay” being defined by many people using the metric of *money earned in a given amount of time*. Common examples are things like dollars per hour, salary in a year, etc. However, this is a completely arbitrary and even faulty metric to determine equal pay.\n\nA superior metric to determine equal pay is *money earned for the value provided.* Lets look at an example:\n\nTwo employees are payed at the same hourly rate. But one employee accomplishes his tasks at ten times the speed as the other, at the same quality.\n\nAre they being paid the same? According to the money/time metric, they are. However, according to the money/value metric, they are not. The harder worker in fact is making *one tenth* the amount of money for the value he provides.\n\nThe difficulty, of course, is how to measure the value of one task compared to another. How do you determine how valuable, say, landscaping is compared to business administration? \n\n*Capitalism does this naturally.* Capitalism will allow the business that produces 10x the value in a given amount of time, to also earn 10x the money in the given amount of time. Value can only be determined by the market, *or what people are willing to give for it*. \n\nMost or any attempt to redistribute this wealth is inherently unequal.\n\nI should note that my view is NOT:\n\nThat capitalism is a perfect system.\n\nThat there is zero inequality or unfairness in capitalism.\n\nThat capitalism is only capitalism with a 100% unregulated economy. \n\nI want to know if there are any flaws in my logic, or if there are any axioms I am taking for granted which are not self evident.",

This is just a tendency I've noted listening to people stories about their experience with mental health field and my own. There are literally people who deem themselves able to help human people, but could not show you even a bit of remorse and understanding and communicate with you. In my case there were few people who would just ask me questions like \"Do you sleep well? Do you eat well?\". What about \"Do you feel well? What are you thinking about lately?\" One of them didn't say anything to me when I cried right in front of him. The other one was just asking polite questions and writing something about me while I was patiently looking at the wall.\n\nIts been a debate in my mind ever since I've first visited psychiatrist. Although I've discovered that there was a lot more to the world than just going to school, playing video games and looking at politics, that there are fields who is researching human soul and help understand feelings of each, I could never accept the fact that there are professional taught by official institutions that could just sit there and listen to you without responding anything, \"analyzing\" you and making you explore your own problems, coldly giving you an opinion from the side, could be of any good to people who seek it.\n\nThe one thing that finally pushed me to create this post is Carl Rogers quote: \"Objectifying people is detrimental to the cause of psychotherapy. Psychiatry could treat biological illnesses, but it has no power against psychological ones\"\n\nThe thing is, I have no issue them treating biologically ill people. These disorders could be classified and understood within a statistical dimension. But what about people? Do you think it is okay to just give out drugs and diagnosing somebody, coldly writing something in your notebook or using knowledge you gained from descriptive psychiatry books? Is it okay to treat people as objects, thinking you may describe them like they are something for sure you have seen alrwady in those books? Should there be a strictly cold, medical approach in a field that's concerned with people's mental health?",

And it's highly probable, though now knowable, that it was for the best even today.\n\nBeyond being Public Enemy #1 for a long time and historically unpredictable, along with being an aging dictator, Saddam Hussein had a clear interest in nuclear weapons. When a country shields its nuclear research centers from international eyes, (even after they were directly attacked by Israel), and sends a diplomat to the ~~Uranium mines~~ Niger with no explanation, it really becomes a matter of putting 1 and 1 together.\n\nNo better comparison exists than North Korea. \n\nNorth Korea represents a major threat to a variety of nations, and harbors some of the most atrocious human right's violations in the world today. Over 25 million people are suffering in poverty because of the regime.\n\nAnd there's nothing anyone can do about it. Many will point out the significance of China or North Korea's conventional forces, but it all starts and ends with nuclear weapons. If we had somehow known with certainty what was going to happen, desert storm would have been quickly followed with an invasion of NK.\n\nThere are other factors that motivate Iraq; sending a post-9/11 message, Israeli Security, and again the danger of Saddam being an aging dictator (see Russia).\n\nBut the primary motivator and entirely legitimate motivator was clear signs that we were headed towards a nuclear armed Iraq.

  "selftext": "I'm going to start off by simply stating the facts:\n\n1. **Pickup trucks and SUVs are more likely to seriously injure or kill someone in the event of a crash** \\- this is simple physics. Pickups and SUVs are larger, and therefore heavier, than passenger cars. You can stick as many airbags and crumple zones in the lighter car as you want, but the fact of the matter is that you cannot completely engineer your way out of freshman-level physics; a truck that weighs 3000 kilograms traveling at 60 miles per hour has twice as much momentum as a car that weighs 1500 kilograms traveling at the same speed; you're not getting around that. To add onto this, the heavier the vehicle, the longer it will take to stop, which is not good if your goal is to avoid the accident in the first place.\n2. **Poor visibility** \\- because trucks and SUVs are taller and have longer hoods than cars, this leads to a front blind spot, which is tragic for pedestrians. [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/the-hidden-dangers-of-big-trucks/) here discusses this phenomenon, opening by discussing a case where an 18-year-old behind the wheel of a Jeep Gladiator struck and killed an elderly grandmother, and claimed to police that he didn't even see her. The thing is, due to the factors regarding overall height and hood length detailed by this very same report, he very well may have been telling the truth.\n3. **Rollovers** \\- once again, this is basic physics. Having a taller vehicle means having a higher center of mass, which means sudden, evasive maneuvers are more likely to tip the vehicle over - simply because not as much cornering force is required to do so. For practical examples of this, look at any video of the moose test, and look at how many of the failing vehicles are trucks and SUVs.\n\nWith all of this in mind, why is it that any Joe Shmoe who took a driving test once when they were a teenager and then never again can drive these vehicles? Not only are they endangering the safety of pedestrians and other vehicles on the road, they are endangering their own safety as well. Not to mention emissions; a heavier vehicle requires more energy to travel at the same speed, period. Are we really going to compromise our emissions targets because somebody feels like they need an SUV to take their kids to soccer practice, or a pickup to get groceries?\n\nEDIT because this argument keeps coming up and I’m frankly tired of responding to it: Yes, this WOULD limit personal freedom; that is the point, it is not an oversight.

  "title": "CMV: As far as I can tell, the outrage over \"tipping culture\" is very misplaced.",
  "selftext": "This is a more complicated view, though this could also be a very quick and dirty CMV to help me straighten out and understand the outrage and the arguments people are making in regards to \"tipping culture\".\n\nI live in the US and I'll be discussing how tipping culture operates here. If you have perspectives from your country, please offer them, though also be mindful that the culture of your country is different from ours and that what flies in your country may not fly in ours.\n\nIf I'm not mistaken, the group of people who hate \"tipping culture\" are upset about the fact that they are essentially required to spend \"extra money\" on their meal. They had some general sense of how much their food and drinks cost, but now they have to tack on this extra 15% or more, and that's bad, because we all worked hard for our money and having to surrender more of it is a problem.\n\nWhat I guess I don't understand, though, is 1) why anyone actually does THINK OF this as \"extra money\" without realizing that this likely represents the total sum they were going to pay, tipping culture or not 2) at least when tipping is optional, you can exercise the right NOT to tip.\n\nTell me where this logic is wrong: if we suddenly decided tipping was to be eradicated, we absolutely HAVE to increase server wages to at least SOME extent. The system is currently designed in a way that a large chunk of their actual income comes from tips, and if that source dries up entirely, only the craziest of servers will continue working that job. They HAVE to have their wages increased to compensate for this. And where will the restaurant owner come up with the money to pay those increased wages? It seems only natural, then, that the cost of the food itself will increase. So at the end of the day, when you bought that $10 burger and then left a $1.50 tip and were big mad about the $1.50, it seems pretty likely that the food simply becomes a $11.50 burger, meaning the amount of money coming out of your wallet is the exact same amount. Where else is the money going to come from to pay these servers?\n\nAnd to follow up on this, if I'm wrong to assume that all of the cost goes into the cost of the food and that you do somehow end up paying less for everything, then why would you be adamant about a system that is going to leave servers with less money? If you really AREN'T paying less, why isn't there then any compassion for the servers themselves who ARE making less money now? If your argument is \"my checking account balance is more important than the livelihood of people who are almost certainly quite poor and struggling to make ends meet\", then how could anyone other than you support a belief like that? Why would I, or anyone else in society, say that we care more about the wealth of the customer than of the servers who are pretty consistently struggling to survive? Why should I care more about you than about them?\n\nTo address my second point, if your viewpoint here really is \"I care more about my money (and perhaps also my family which I support with my money) than I care about the livelihood of the guy who brought me my food\", then why on earth would you NOT support tipping culture, seeing as how you can just always leave no tip and get your food for less money out of your pocket? If we did away with tipping culture, that will almost certainly increase the price of your food and force you to pay more money, so then why WOULDN'T you want tipping culture in place?\n\nFinally, can someone just help me understand the sheer OUTRAGE over anyone taking a stance that perhaps people have the wrong ideas about tipping culture? I'm writing this after reading [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/15667lr/comment/jsywlp5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which was received VERY poorly, with aggressive counter-attacks like\n\n>Tipping only give stress everyone, just stop it.  \n>  \n>Congrats on being part of the problem\n\nThis is a thing I've noticed, that not only do people disagree, they are HOSTILE in their disagreement. I mean I know this is reddit, I know it's the internet, but for real, when I see people discuss this issue, I see downright HOSTILITY about it which has always baffled me. That makes me think that people are far more protective of their money than I thought and that this perceived \"extra money\" they are spending or whatever must be extremely offensive because of that. Anyone who can help me understand the outrage? Clearly I'm missing something because tipping culture has always just been another thing to discuss in my book, like one's favorite movie or what kind of salad dressing one prefers to eat. It's literally just a thing to talk about, but people are FURIOUS about this one, and I just don't get it. I can already tell this is a thread that's going to have about a 4% upvote rate and that every comment I leave here is going to wind up with a karma count of like -998 simply because of my stance here, so I guess it's good I've banked up some positive karma in this sub so I can withstand the decimation of my karma lol. Why is it that I have to worry about that sort of thing, is my main question.\n\nCMV.\n\nEdit: I want to summarize the three main responses I've heard here and collectively give my thoughts on them. These are the reasons for the outrage that I have heard:\n\n1. ***Non-restaurants are asking for tips now, and that's too much.*** I agree with that, and I've already awarded a delta on this point.\n2. ***Some places are asking for larger tips than they used to, mandating or strongly suggesting tips in the range of 20% or so.*** I don't think this is a symptom of \"tipping culture\"; I think it's a symptom of the pandemic and the devastation it wrought on restaurants, and they likely are having to up prices to make up for it. In short, it's a thing I'd expect to just be wrapped up in the cost of food if it weren't expected as a tip, so I don't think this is some effort to really screw the consumer and I don't think the amount you pay changes, thus the \"outrage\" is indeed misplaced. Be mad at COVID-19, not at tipping culture.\n3. ***When you don't tip, servers take note and are jerks to you and mess with your food and what not.*** I'm skeptical of this claim, as there's at least one food service employee who replied here and said that that's really not a thing that happens. But even if it did, honestly, I'm not sympathetic. I'm far more sympathetic to the server struggling to make ends meet, and if you deprived them of their income, it's hard for me to feel any sympathy towards you when they treat you like shit. Not to mention, this can obviously only become a problem at your SECOND visit to a restaurant at the very earliest since it is in response to your poor service at your FIRST visit, and if you didn't like the service and went back to the place again, it's starting to look a lot like being your own damn fault.",

  "selftext": "As a genetically ugly dude who’s like a 3 on his best day, I’ve seen this idea that one can just “glow up” and become more physically attractive if they are just willing to put in the work. I don’t think this is true. \n\nI think that typically peoples level of physical attractiveness is set in stone and 90% due to genetics. This gives them a hard upper limit that they can’t surpass unless they get some extensive plastic surgery to fix the flaws in their facial bone structure or height, etc.\n\nI do however think it’s easy to drop below this. Mainly due to weight gain, poor hygiene, and not taking care of yourself. Once they allow these things to overcome their basic level of attractiveness, they shoot down. A natural 7 could easily become a 3 if they get fat, have shitty hygiene or take other actions that make them uglier. \n\nWhen people “glow up”, all they’re doing is undoing those actions. This is why glowing up typically happens into early adulthood, as your body exits puberty and hormones stop fluctuating like crazy, you get a chance to undo things like baby fat, adopt a skincare regimen that isn’t impeded by hormonal skin blemishes, you’re producing normal levels of testosterone and estrogen enough to combat weight gain, you’re on your own and able to develop healthy eating habits and go workout if you so please, it’s much easier to hit that window.\n\nI think when you are genetically destined to be ugly, your lows are just lower. When I was in high school I was a 2. I was fat, terrible skin, and I had terrible bone structure, a huge forehead huge lips and a huge nose, Afrocentric features, very dark skin, a negative canthil tilt, but lots of other people around me were in just as bad situations.\n\nWhen I got to college I started going to the gym regularly, I got more physically active, had more control over my diet, I developed a skincare routine that helped me out, I had my own money so I could get haircuts I wanted, get manicures, get my eyebrows threaded, do all of the things that people do when they’re trying to improve the way they look. \n\nNone of I worked. Hell, I’ve been lifting for now 2.5 years and have fluctuated massively in weight and I still look the exact same I did in high school with just a slightly more defined jawline. That’s because none of the thing that actually make me genetically ugly have changed because unless I get surgery (which I do plan on getting) to fix my problem areas it can’t. No amount of attempted self improvement will fix that.\n\nI think this is the case for any case of “glowing up” for there to be a significant difference you have to already be genetically gifted. If you’re not it’s just putting lipstick on a pig.",

Before I get into it I'd like to preface this by saying I'm aware of the social norms and the potential backlash. \n\nI'm not a bad person, I try to help people and I know deep down at least some part of you will agree with this view. Anyway, change my view... I think forks are the best utensil for spreading mayo onto bread. \n\nLet's start with the dollop. A knife provides a laughable amount of mayo, so you'll be going back to the jar two, maybe three times. Spoon is second best for dollop but still has the potential to drastically overload the sandwich. By the time you finish the sandwich you'll be wearing half of the mayo. \n\nOnto the spread. The spoon is obviously the worst, getting an even spread is impossible, the lowest valley of the spoon forces mayo towards the edges and creates a wave of mayo that ends up piling onto the edge of your sandwich, increasing spill danger. The knife is good, a lot of people would even say great. I'll use a knife if I'm in a pinch but a fork works just as well, with the added dollop bonus. The forks voids allow mayo to seep through, back into dollop position. From here it's easy to either spread it on a dry area of bread or send it right back into the tub. \n\nOfficial rankings below\n\nDollop \nSpoon- 8/10\nFork-10/10\nKnife- 3/10\n\nSpread\nSpoon - 4/10\nFork-10/10\nKnife-9/10\n\nOvr- \nSpoon- 6/10\nKnife- 6/10\nFork-10/10\n\nEdit: I've been made aware that several people just want a bit of mayo on their sandies, that's okay. My sandwiches are usually pretty thick, like half the container of turkey, one slice of melted cheese and a decent bit of lettuce. If it's a small sandwich then sure, knife is fine. But if you want to get serious about sandwiches you gotta pull the fork out. \n\nOpinion unchanged for big sandwich people, I'll give you that knife dollops are fine for little sandwiches, probably even equal to the fork.

  "selftext": "In my opinion, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka would do better off if united.\n\nMy 1st reason is that all of these countries have close cultural ties with each other. My Indian and Pakistani friend both speak Urdu fluently, despite one being Indian and the other being Pakistani. I, an Indian, have Bangladeshi neighbours who I feel culturally close with, despite me being Indian and them being Bangladeshi. My Pakistani teacher and my Indian classmate both speak Panjabi together, despite them not even being from the same country. My Pakistani teacher is absolutely obsessed with Bollywood, especially Shahrukh Khan, despite him being from India. My Pakistani friend shares memes with me. Although those memes are directed to a Pakistani audience, I can understand those memes as well. For a while, the Pakistani audience turned to Bollywood due to a lack of quality cinema from Pakistani cinema industries.\n\nMy 2nd reason is the melting pot this new country would be. Imagine how many cultures would be in this country! Moreover, these cultures are interlinked, and the cultures are even across borders, such as Bangal and Panjab. All of these cultures, could interlink and learn from each other, making them flourish. More so, the main difference between India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh are religious differences. If various religious groups can co-exist in western countries, then why can't they do that in South-Asia? Furthermore, many Muslims are respected in India, such as Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, and Aamir Khan. In Pakistan, many Hindus are respected, such as Danish Kaneria, Deepak Perwani, etc. More so, this change might decrease the nationalistic feelings of citizens of the 6 countries, since they don't have any enemies to hate.\n\nMy 3rd and final reason is that this might improve geo-political relations internationally. For example, China and Pakistan are allies, and India and the United States of America are allies. If India and Pakistan unite, then this might bring a closer gap between the United States of America and China. The border between India and Pakistan is so armed that the floodlights on the border can be seen from space. Right now, China is taking over Jammu and Kashmir, but if India and Pakistan unite, then they can repel China due to them not having to fight over the territory. \n\nThese is why I believe that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka should unite.",

So if my guesstimate about political beliefs regarding guns in the rising generation are semi correct for a conservative university, then I would guess Gen Z and millennials as a whole are probably anti gun. My guesstimate also comes from these poll results.\n\nAccording to the Harvard poll, about two thirds of Americans 18-30 want gun laws to be more strict and 58% support and assault rifle ban.\n\nIn the Pew poll from 2021, Hispanic persons support stricter gun control at a 65% rate while for white persons support it at a 45% rate, and Hispanics are the fastest growing ethnic minority in the US at this time. There is also a trend that urban and suburban voters support gun control more than rural voters and 18-30 year olds are a lot more likely to live in the city and the suburbs than in the country. Those who are more highly educated like those who went to grad school or graduated from an undergrad degree are more likely to support stricter gun control than those who graduated from high school only, and todays young adults are more highly educated than the young adults of 40 years ago.\n\nhttps://iop.harvard.edu/about/newsletter-press-release/harvard-iop-youth-poll-finds-stricter-gun-laws-ban-assault-weapons\n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/04/20/amid-a-series-of-mass-shootings-in-the-u-s-gun-policy-remains-deeply-divisive/\n\nAlso, 18-30 year olds have spent a more significant part of their lives constantly hearing about mass shootings in the news than their parents and grandparents have, potentially making them more hostile towards gun rights.",

  "selftext": "I'm sure most people have seen the recent protests and blackouts on Reddit over the \"outrageous\" pricing Reddit is adding for their API. This pricing being the company will charge $12,000 for 50 million API requests. Many people seem to believe this pricing is so ridiculous it's actually an attempt to completely shutdown 3rd party clients.\nI do not believe Reddit's pricing is absurd, and this entire issue has been blown way out of portion.\n\nI'll break down why I feel this way into two sections\n\n#  The Imgur Comparison\n\nI think the main reason people feel Reddit's pricing is insane, is because of the following quote from the Apollo developer\n\n> [For reference, I pay Imgur (a site similar to Reddit in user base and media) $166 for the same 50 million API calls.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_title&embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F31%2F23743993%2Freddit-apollo-client-api-cost)\n\nThere's one gigantic issue with that statement. Imgur's public API pricing is actually [$3,333 for 50 million API calls](https://rapidapi.com/imgur/api/imgur-9/pricing). I have no idea if Selig is lying, I don't know if he was grandfathered into a significantly cheaper plan, and I don't know if he was just being misleading on purpose..i'm just not gonna address that.\n\nBut even in the best case scenario where Imgur privately just gave Selig a far cheaper deal, Reddit's upcoming API pricing should not be compared to Selig's private deal. It should be compared to Imgur's public pricing, therefore Reddit's API is only going to be 3.6 times more expensive than Imgur's API. A far cry from the widely spread 72 times more expensive, and I think it's perfectly understandable Reddit's API would be about three times more expensive than Imgur's, because Reddit hosts more complicated data including much longer videos.\n\n# Operating Costs\n\nThe other reason I feel like the price is perfectly fine is when you compare the per user costs to Reddit premium.\n\nSelig says he calculated an estimated cost for these changes to be [$2.50 per month per user.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_title&embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2023%2F5%2F31%2F23743993%2Freddit-apollo-client-api-cost) Putting that into perspective. A user would be getting an ad free Reddit experience for $2.50 per month. Reddit premium, whose primary selling feature is no ads, costs $6.99 per month. Reddit is basically giving developers a wholesale discount on Reddit premium for their users, and there's plenty of room between $2.5 and $6.99 for a 3rd party app developer to make profit even when accounting for development costs.\n\nIf we look at Apollo costs specifically, the subscription prior to the pending shutdown was [$1.50 per month](https://apolloapp.io/pro-ultra/#:~:text=It%20is%20a%20subscription%20of,Why%20a%20subscription%3F). If we just add the old subscription to the new API costs, he would have to charge only $4 a month to make the exact same profit per subsciption. That price is still undercutting Reddit premium, and would continue to heavily incentivize users who hate ads to use Apollo over Reddit Premium.\n\nJust for comparison here's some ad free memberships with other companies. \n\nCompany | Price\n:--|:--:|--:\nHulu | $14.99 per month\nYoutube | $11.99 per month\nSpotify | $9.99 per month\nTwitter | $7.99 per month\nImgur | $4.99 per month\n\n---\n\nAnyone is welcome to try and change my view that the pricing is completely fair and within reason.",

  "selftext": "Trying to understand the American tendancy to say they are Italian/ Irish/ Scottish, even if they've never been there. How much of this is culture, how much of this is upholding damaging stereotypes of other nationalities?\n\nSo I know this could be a potentially touchy subject for some, but it's a topic that invokes a lot of different emotions from me, so I'd like to hear some genuine American opinions on this.\n\nAs a Scottish person, when I meet Americans that tell me that they are also Scottish I can sometimes find it a but frustrating. Context is key of course, but I've had someone tell me that they are Scottish \"too\" because an ancestor way back when came from here to America. Its then often met with the American spouting off dated and offensive stereotypes to show me how Scottish they are. \n\nI don't know how many times I've come across people talking about being from this Clan or the great great great great grandson of a Clan chief. Or people proudly perpetrating redundant perceptions of Scottish people, and feel entitled to do so because they are \"Scottish\". I just don't like it. Clan history is Scotland is one ancient part of it. God there's so much I can say on that but I'll move on.\n\nI've got a few Irish friends and this seems to be an even bigger phenomenon for them. I think with the troubles and Irish suppression there seems to be more 'cause' to get behind, as well as the identity.\n\nNow don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that America is a melting pot/ salad bowl culture. Your country isn't as old as mine, infact we have universities that outdate your nation. So I guess in that sense communities can retain identities in different ways. Plus a lot of immigrant communities from the old world have grown round where the ships would dock. People settled together with the people they left with. So purely down to those historical/ geographical facts, I get why there is no 'one' American identity.\n\nI know that A LOT of immigrant communities experienced hardship, racism, otherism and were left to live in squalor. These immigrant communities worked hard to build sustainable lives for themselves. Forged careers and businesses that became iconic within America ie Italian food. Irish pubs etc.\n\nI can totally see the relevance to identifying as Scottish American, Italian American or Irish American. Unique communities, with unique identities that are deserving of their own American label. I guess this would make 'American' an umbrella term? \n\nHowever, I genuinely find it problematic when Americans equate their ancestral identity as meaning they are entitled to identifying with the stereotypes of the homeland.\n\nTo use Scotland as an example. We are a very socialist nation. We have a very complicated national identity within the landscape of the UK. We face serious, and I really do mean serious, issues relating to drug and alcohol abuse. We have contributed to colonialism and we have also been suppressed. What it means to be Scottish changes drastically between the East end of Glasgow and the West End of Edinburgh. I believe my countries issues are often over simplified and over commodified on the international level. I just don't like it when people misinterpret what it means to be Scottish because they are viewing it through the rose tinted glasses of ancestral love.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I appreciate it when Americans take part in our culture. We love that yous love us. I can't speak for other communities but I know across Europe, its widely accepted that its rude when Americans expect to be accepted as a part of the old countries communities. That we are expected to act excited when yous \"come home\", welcomed \"back\" so it were. It almost comes across entitled, that you assume you know us so well, when what you know has been passed down to you from generations.\n\nThis obviously excludes people who are dual nationality. Or are raised in 1st/2nd and in some cases 3rd gen immigrant households.\n\nI'd also like to note that there IS a distinction between journeying to view the land of your ancestors, and coming to a country and expecting to be viewed as part of that community without little to no assimilation.\n\nSo enlighten me, is there more to this I'm missing?",

Unless something was done with racist intent OR something had an objectively racist outcome regardless of intent, how could somebody possibly bear responsibility for racism when the qualities that determine skin color are completely separate from the ones that determine racist attitudes. \n\nIt seems like manipulation to me. Make somebody think they're responsible or they have some sort of additional obligation so they focus a huge amount of time on the problem and the problem is more likely to be fixed even though there's no case to be made that the individual actually was, in any way, responsible. Because I just do not see how anybody could made the case that a white person has an extra obligation to fix racism because of their skin color. \n\nBut that's why I'm here, so CMV!",

  "selftext": "CMV:\n\nI am hoping that somebody can explain to me why I am incorrect\n\nThis film currently holds a 53/100 (indicated mixed to average) on Metacritic, based on 23 critic reviews. This aggregate, to me, is enough to state that it is not critically acclaimed. On a side not, it received a 66% on Rotten Tomatoes, far from 'acclaim.'\n\nCurrently, I am being rapidly downvoted on Ask Reddit for saying that the Blind Side is not critically acclaimed. The main, and only counterpoint, is its Oscar recognition. Sandra Bullock won the Oscar for best actress. I do not think this is indicative of the response to the film as a whole. An actor can play a great role in a bad film. The two are mutually exclusive. It was also nominated for best motion picture, which I think is a better reason. However, I do not think that this is enough to say the movie was 'critically acclaimed.' We'd be able to call some pretty bad movies critically acclaimed if we looked at positive reviews from 1 or a couple outlets, rather than the larger aggregate.\n\nI believe I am correct, but my 100 downvotes would state otherwise. I would like for people to articulate to me why I am wrong, because currently most responses have been colorful ways of calling me an idiot. Thanks.\n\nEDIT: You guys have changed my view (idk how to do this). I have been taking the term 'critical acclaim' too seriously. A film just needs to get some critical acclaim from a few parties and it is a critically acclaimed film. The majority of critics panning the film does not negate the acclaim that it did receive.

  "title": "CMV: Limiting access to firearms in the United States would play a significant role in decreasing net suicide",
  "selftext": "The United States has one of the highest suicide rates in the world, with over half of those deaths being from firearms (~55%). This is despite the fact they only make up a small portion of the total suicide attempts with roughly 75% of all suicide attempts being overdoses, something effective between 1-3% of the time. The reason for this disparity between attempt and success is due to the lethality of firearms combined the ease of usage. It’s the reason men in the US have a higher suicide rate than women but less attempts. \n\n Limiting access to means, also known as [means restriction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191653/): “entails a community or societal action that (ideally) does not depend on an individual’s intention or volition. Applied to the population as a whole, it typically affects people whose suicide risk is otherwise undetected and who do not seek therapeutic assistance to prevent their crisis or for life-saving interventions when necessary. Removal or restriction of access to a lethal method changes the context of a potential suicide by precluding potentially fatal actions or forcing the use of a less lethal method. Because means restriction is broadly applied, detection of its individual- level effect is often impossible; it is best measured by aggregate findings of method-specific community rates of suicide and related self-harm injuries.”\n\nIn the case of guns, this would involve actions like enforcing gun control measures, though for this CMV I’m mainly discussing less individual laws and more the efficacy of limiting means. \n\nTo describe the effects of mean removal, I’ll use an example that’s not firearms. \n\nFatal Gas poisonings were fairly common both in the US and UK prior to laws around it and the addition catalytic converters being used in car exhausts. These limited the ability for people to commit suicide via this method and as a result, the net suicide rate dropped as a result. The same thing happened with a common pesticide used in suicide in India that was restricted leading to a decreased net suicide rate without a replacement. \n\nThe replacement part being a major factor. Many argue that suicidal people will just find another means, so-called means substitution. While there is data supporting this and other data denying this, the means substitution ultimately would still lead to less deaths because no other suicide method common to the United States is anywhere nearly as lethal, socially considerable, or easy to access. All of which matter to someone acting in a rash decision to end their life. Switching those individuals from a 90% chance of dying to a 1-3% (assuming mean substitution went to most common method) would save lives.\n\nWhen it comes to CMV, I think if anyone can demonstrate why in the US this would not be effective, I would be very interested in hearing it. That said, I don’t care much for any arguments regarding the issues of gun restriction, just their efficacy at reducing suicide.",

  "selftext": "Edit: I think some people may have misinterpreted my view based on the title. I meant \"It is Illogical For People to Criticize Art Because it Contains Sexual Themes\". I understand why people may criticize specific sexual themes in art if they are immoral (for example if it contains pedophilia)\n\nI think there is a trend for the general public to claim that any art having sexual themes must be \"lower in value\" compared to art that does not have those themes. A big example is the relentless criticism Cardi B got for her song saying that because the song is vulgar, that means it must be bad. While I do not like listening to vulgar music, that is simply a personal preference, and I do not think an art piece being vulgar is correlated to it being \"bad\" or \"good\".\n\nAs for my reasoning why this is, I believe the main purpose of art is the expression of human emotion. That is why so many movies, songs, books, drawings, have to do with love, war, appreciation of beauty, etc. So why is expressing desire for another human being not also a valid emotion that deserves to be expressed? Why is it \"normal\" for there to be a song like Taylor Swift's \"Red\", expressing her love for someone, or a song like Olivia's \"Good 4 U\" expressing her hate for someone, but as soon as a song is about lust and desire, it is suddenly considered \"weird\" and suddenly there is all types of finger pointing, stifled laughter, or \"what about the children\" talking points?\n\nWhile it is true that children may be too young to understand sex, it is the parents' responsibility to keep that content away. There are many tv shows, movies, and books that feature violence that is not appropriate for children either, but those are considered high value works (Death Note, for example) and are praised rather than having the same criticisms directed at it, which I find hypocritical.\n\nIn my opinion, people who criticize art by saying \"this is objectively bad and disgusting because it is vulgar\" only do it because of taste and are not logical in their criticism. I think it's fine if the general opinion is \"It's fine, but I don't listen to it because it is not my type of content\" but many people do not say this. I generally want my view on this to be changed (not completely, but to an extent), or at least understand the viewpoint from the other side, mostly because I know people with the opposite view and I don't understand them.",

Even as a child, the religion never sat right with me and ever since leaving I've been on a constant search of what to believe in life. Revisiting this god forsaken belief system, I think I'm close to a conclusion. And I can go down the rabbit hole, but I will do my best to keep this short.\n\nModern christianity is obsessed with morals. What is good, evil, and what glorifies their definition of god. Ok, we know this, but from my understanding what they define as good and evil is them justifying suffering and valuing pity. This is how herd mentality was formed. A priest tells you to pity those who have done you wrong, who have acted against you, then tell you it's a part of a plan we know nothing about because our suffering *has* to have meaning. It has to. So we make the herd weak.\n\nAs we make the herd weak, we make the herd believe in our concept of evil so now all the suffering, pain, torment, everything that is wronged against you is not their fault, so who's fault is it? Well it's your fault. Forgive them, for they do not know; and to me, that's just a roundabout way of making your herd feel guilt.  So we've made the herd subservient and have instilled in them to feel bad about themselves when other people have done bad things to them. That is absolutely fucking horrible.\n\nAnd as a black man, I take this one step further. The African slaves were forced to be christian. So through generations of extreme trauma and suffering, it confounds me that an entire culture today would choose to be christian when the evils that were done to them were in the name of the same god they worship. \n\nI'll make an analogy: If I was abducted and my capturer said everything they did to me was in the name of Pikachu, I would **never** associate myself with anything Pokemon related ever again once I was rescued.",

Now, I am not saying that this played no part, especially in the leading up to the current state but I do not believe taking away guns now will do anything. Mass shootings have unfortunately just become so ingrained in the culture in the US. They have been happening so often for so long  and have taken such a large portion of the public's attention at times that people who wish to go out with a bang in the US will always think of carrying out a mass shooting a lot more than their counterparts in the other parts of the world. A European for example since I live there, will probably not even consider a mass shooting. It is not in their sphere of attention and thinking pretty much at all while a troubled American on the contrary views it as an everyday and viable option if they wish to kill themselves for example.

  "selftext": "Before I start, let's categorize the SUVs:\n\n- Crossovers, evolving towards station wagons and hatchbacks, but still SUVs so I'd categorize them as such, like Volvo XC60. \n\n- Small SUVs, most common in Europe, like Dachia Duster. \n\n- Big SUVs, mostly found in the US and Canada, but slowly coming to Europe, like Cadillac Escalade.\n\n- Pickup trucks, most common in the US and Canada, like Ford F150.        \n\nI don't understand the SUV trend. It is neither ecological, nor economical, nor ergonomic, nor safe. The fingers of the inhabitants of half a block of flats would need to count how many I see in parking lots, streets, side streets and thoroughfares during a day or several. And inside is some little woman or guy from or to work, school, home or shop.  \n\nSUVs are gas-guzzling. This is simple physics. The more mass, the more energy it needs to move at the same speed. The engines of SUVs were designed specifically for off-road so 4 wheel drive is the standard in many of them. 4 wheel drive helps you in mud but doesn't help you slow down, so drivers can drive as fast as they want to, as soon as they don't plan on stopping. The worst are pick-ups which have even more ridiculous fuel consumption, because they are for off road and transporting elements in the wilderness of Canada and Northern US.   \n\nSUVs are not eco-friendly. Here we return to their fuel guzzling.  \n\nThe ergonomics of SUVs and pickups are terrible. One such can take up from 1.5 to 2 parking spaces. And that's not an exaggeration. Pickup trucks often have to stand on the pavement, for the inconvenience of the pavement, just to fit in and not block the roads. In one parking lot near my block, I see an SUVoza station and a destiny that juts out on both sides of the road and a second space so as not to block either of them. Passing SUVs on the streets of an old city is a tragedy.           \n\nAnd most importantly, they are deadly. A higher center of gravity equals a greater chance of a rollover, and a difference in height means zero chance for a car, pedestrian or cyclist. Especially pedestrians and cyclists. A normal car will simply scoop you up like a snow shovel on the roof, which sucks, but doesn't kill you in most cases. Small SUVs and crossovers hit you in the hips and head, you're even more screwed. Pickups and big SUVs are the worst because they sweep you under the vehicle where NOT. YOU HAVE. CHANCE. For survival. In addition, the higher height, so you will not see a small child, which is almost a guarantee of accidents in suburban housing estates and prefabricated blocks. The blind spot in front of the hood of the SUV could fit 8 crouching children in a row, and none of them can be seen from the driver's perspective. In addition, the majority of drivers, not only in the US, but globally, according to manufacturers' research, are poor and dangerous drivers, using them to avoid the consequences of their actions. Such drivers don't think about other people, use their phones more while driving, are more risky while driving and obsessed with high status. [Source 1](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/bigger-vehicles-are-directly-resulting-in-more-deaths-of-people-walking/) and [source 2.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15568310701359015)           \n\nPeople buy them to prop up their ego. They used to buy them when they needed them for hard work, for the countryside or off road. Now, thanks to the propaganda of the car industry, which has more money, people buy them, but the lines of more practical cars, such as the Ford Focus, are closed because almost no one buys them anymore. By the way, this turns into an arms race. People are concerned about accidents involving SUVs, so they buy bigger ones to win.\n\nWe should prevent it. But first the counterarguments. First of all, it's none of my business who drives what and that limits freedom and communism. But your freedom to wave your hand and drive an SUV ends where my face begins and the sidewalk separated by a green belt. Besides, it's my business whether, as a pedestrian, I get into an accident and whether this accident will not end in death. Would you have said the same thing when gun licenses were introduced and alcohol advertising and cigarette packaging were regulated to warn of the dangerous effects of their use? Secondly, you need space and you have to tow something. But SUVs don't actually have a trunk. The DACIA Duster has 408 liters of luggage space, and the FORD Focus 2014 has 476 liters with the seats up and 1262 liters with the seats folded down. There's roomy goodness in every station wagon's trunk. Every family had one before automakers convinced the aging GenX that what they needed was an SUV with a 1.2m hood. Besides, people who buy SUVs mostly don't carry anything bigger or tow any yacht or trailer. If you really need that space and comfort, there are minivans. For businesses, there are vans. They are easier to come out of and have low hoods so you see everything.\n  \nAlso, there are no sports in Sports Utility Vehicles. There's no sport in driving an SUV (Unless you run over pedestrians on Reddit or Twitter).\n\nWe should prevent it somehow, [maybe even some petitions to regulate it](https://action.consumerreports.org/20221116_stop_blindspots) [or ban](https://www.acturgently.org/ban_suvs). Parking permits should be more expensive for SUVs to compensate for their size. Ads for these monsters should have warnings just like ads for alcohol and cigarettes. And getting registered and allowed to own one should be like getting a gun license, with a psychological test to make sure no psycho runs over anyone or anything. People who need them would be required to have a commercial licence.\n\nFor more information, here's a Not Just Bikes video on that [problem.](https://youtu.be/UYIYkesDCeU)",

However, the market says that rent will approach just under a mortgage, or even above, since that is what people are willing to pay as opposed to putting down a down payment on a house and paying a mortgage.\n\nThe problem as I see it is that while landlords do assume some risk, and have to provide some services, the return they are able to collect vastly outweighs any of these risks. This arises because the housing market is not the same as something like the hamburger market, since people need houses and houses are limited by space.\n\nLandlords take advantage of this by \"getting there first\" and providing a barrier to housing that we must pay to cross. Much like a guy on a bridge collecting a toll. This goes against the nature of capitalism and competition, which I consider a net negative to society.\n\nInstead, the owning of housing to rent should be outlawed, and the government should provide it instead. The difference I see is that the government would act exactly as the landlord would, but wouldn't have a maximum profit motive, and instead would charge a minimum (0) profit rent, which could easily be extended to a rent-to-own program when tenants choose to pay over the minimum property maintenance costs.\n\nI'm not an economist so I'm sure there's some flaws with this, but I think the main reason it or something similar hasn't happened yet is due to the obscene amounts of wealth that have been extracted from renters being feed back to lawmakers to keep the status quo in a classic capitalist feedback loop.\n\nTLDR: The rental housing market doesn't lend itself well to standard capitalism and competition and therefore should be run by the government.",

This double standard intrigues me. Is it because English accents, particularly from the UK, are often associated with a certain level of prestige or desirability in popular culture? Or is there a deeper, perhaps historical or socio-political reason that makes the mimicry of certain accents more socially acceptable than others?\n\nI'm genuinely curious and open to changing my view. What am I missing in understanding why these situations are perceived so differently?",

  "title": "CMV: Soccer is a bad spectator sport",
  "selftext": "A good sport is balanced in such a way that there is a high mix of drives/possessions etc. ending in various amounts of points, or no points for one side. In tennis, every serve ends up in a score for one side or the other. In American Football, there are various ways to score, and many drives end up in some amount of points, and many drives end up in no points. But in Soccer? It’s so difficult to score that it’s extremely common for entire games to end up 0-0. And because it’s so difficult to score, the overtime penalty kickoff tie-breaker barely even resembles the primary game at all. Because of this extreme difficulty in scoring, one team can dominate the other team on the field, and it just doesn’t matter because it’s not enough domination to result in actually scoring. The bar to score is simply very high. Good sports aren’t good on accident. American Football is famous for adjusting the rules to make it easier to score, resulting in a game with a higher percentage of drives ending in scores. This balance change improved the sport because before, there were so few scores in a game that ties were common. Ties are really bad, since they don’t differentiate the teams. Yet Soccer refuses to address this issue, and their problem persists.\n\nEdit: the responses are that people enjoy watching it. I know many people do enjoy watching it. I’m arguing it’s design is objectively and fundamentally flawed and soccer is wrong not to fix it. I’m not saying “I don’t enjoy the sport so no one should.” There are a lot of sports I don’t enjoy but I think are well-designed sports. I’m saying soccer’s design makes it a pretty bad competition.\n\nEdit 2: I’m not saying upsets are bad. Upsets are good. Parity is good. But the team that wins should be the team that played better. What that means is when underdogs win, it should be because they earned it. And even more importantly, when one team plays significantly better, it shouldn’t result in a draw.\n\nEdit 3: I just want to say that I am asking this question is good faith, and not to troll. Although some commenters seem offended, and some have been hostile, which I don’t think is acceptable, some of y’all have made some very good and interesting points, and I feel that I understand the perspective of soccer fans a lot better now. To the people engaging in a kind and sincere manner, I’m really grateful.\n\nEdit 4: to summarize: I hate that soccer is a low scoring game. NOT so much because low scoring = boring. I know it’s a common perspective but it is NOT the perspective I was bringing in. I hate it because low scoring leads to draws, which I detest, and because the team that played better that day, by various metrics such as time of possession, time on opponent’s side of the field, shots on goal, eyeball test, etc., can often walk away with a draw anyway or a loss. To me, I could not understand why y’all don’t fix your game to make scoring easier. But it turns out what’s a bug for me is a feature to you. Apparently y’all really like the way that low scoring leads to an increased luck factor, that allows for underdogs to win more often because the luck factor reduces the impact that skillful play plays on winning the game. Soccer is not for me, but I at least understand y’all and why y’all aren’t changing your game, and I sincerely appreciate your time and perspective, and can at least see and understand why you’d prefer it the way it is.",

  "selftext": "Tl;dr: Mainstream groups that aim for gender equality are useless at addressing issues that mostly affect men because they only really care about women.\n\nUsually when people bring up areas where men are worse off than women (e.g. college enrollment rates, suicide, homelessness, loneliness) and say that efforts should be made to address them, the response is that gender based issues already have a solution which is feminist groups. I'd argue that feminist groups shouldn't be left to solve them.\n\nIt seems to me that **most** feminist groups only care about men's issues if they affect women. Recently I saw [this article linked](https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/features/a27259689/toxic-masculinity-male-friendships-emotional-labor-men-rely-on-women/) and it describes how men are increasingly likely to be lonely. The article argues that this is a problem because it affects women who are stuck dealing with the men in their lives who are otherwise isolated. That these men are miserable is an afterthought.\n\nSimilarly, boys who start to be exposed to Andrew Tate are seen as problems because of how they might behave later in life with women. Incels are problems because they might hurt women but the fact that they're lonely and miserable is ignored. Usually when feminist writers bring up the way women are a majority of college students, it leads to complaints that these women find dating harder and that they're more likely to struggle with student debt.\n\nIt seems that if men would only be miserable, lonely and suicidal on their own and avoid women, these groups would be perfectly happy so I don't trust them to care about these problems beyond trying to further isolate the men affected.\n\n**EDIT: For all the people saying \"this is like asking the NAACP to care about anti-semitism\", I'd argue feminism portrays itself as fighting sexism and gender inequality, not a group for one demographic like the NAACP.**",

  "selftext": "I visited Germany over the summer, and saw the English language just about everywhere I went. Now this could be explained by me visiting touristy areas, and that is fair enough, but it got me thinking: English is used everywhere online, it is by far the most used language on the internet, and it is the language that is most often used to bridge disparate groups together. At the same time, due to the combined influence of the former British Empire and the current United States, English is the preeminent language of science, culture, media, and many more aspects of our globalized world. The most telling aspect of all of this is the fact that in the European Union, a majority of its citizens know English, despite the fact that only 1% of its population speaks it natively. Humans are creatures of convenience, we desire to make things as easy as possible. So it makes sense to all learn a single language that can bind us all together, especially as the world becomes more connected and national identities become weaker. \n\nThere are some rebuttals which I will address here. First is that history is constantly changing and there is a good chance English falls out of favor. And that is very fair. However, even if it is not English, a single global language for all of humanity still makes sense. Another is that this language would in turn diverge into a whole new set of languages, like Latin and the Romance languages. Technology however, will prevent that. Languages diverged because of distance and lack of communication, something which is becoming less common today. You are starting to see accents and dialects of languages disappear due to greater interconnectedness. The final point is greater nationalism and jingoism. This is something which could happen, but it would be an abandonment of the globalized world that has existed for decades. You often see groups who are nativist in the West labeled as bigots, while in non Western societies learning the global language will be seen as abandoning the conservative cultures which have held them back.",

Obama once insisted that the United States rejects unilateral action by the U.N, and that only a negotiated settlement would bring peace, but this appears naïve to me at best and outright lying at worst. The two-state solution is the only fair solution to this conflict. Israel has the right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state, but the Palestinians also have a right to self-determination. A one-state solution would cause Israel to become about half-Jewish and half-Muslim, and the Jews have no intention of giving the Palestinians equal rights which would threaten their Jewish majority (evidenced by West Bank settlement expansion which annexes disputed territory into Israel with no intention of assimilating the Palestinians as Arab Israelis are).  It is not fair to the Palestinians to keep them as a permanently stateless people under foreign occupation, nor would it be fair to the Jews to deny them their own right to a state and self-determination.

  "selftext": "Element 99: Einsteinium (named after Albert Einstein: primary author of special and general relativity, discovered the photoelectric effect (reason why solar panels work), etc. Let's be honest, we have all heard of this guy)\n\nElement 100: Fermium (named after Enrico Fermi: lead first team to control a nuclear reaction, memorialized in Fermi-Dirac statistics, and many more contributions. Probably less of us have heard of this guy, but still one of the most recognizable names in physics)\n\nReasons why I think we should change their names... a tale of destruction, secrecy, betrayal, martyrdom, regret, and the dark side of science, here we go:\n\n1. Elements 99 and 100 were **discovered by analyzing a debris sample taken by fighter pilots who flew into a mushroom cloud resulting from the first hydrogen bomb test** (bolded because this context will become relevant). Neither Einstein nor Fermi were present at the test or involved in the analysis in any way.\n2. Both Einstein and Fermi died between the time the names were originally proposed and when they were announced. The elements were officially named after their deaths, without their consent.\n3. Neither Einstein nor Fermi ever actively searched for new elements.\n4. Einstein's involvement with nuclear weapons is that he sent a letter to the US president saying that they are a real physical possibility, and the Nazis are working on it, so you should too. Later in life, Einstein deeply regretted sending that letter, as the Nazis failed to develop one anyways.\n5. On the other hand, Fermi was heavily involved in the Manhatten project (US development of nuclear weapons), so this could be a counterpoint. However, while Fermi saw developing nuclear weapons during wartime as a necessity, he had mixed feelings about the whole thing later in life after seeing what became of it.\n6. Both Einstein and Fermi are already famous as s\\*\\*t and memorialized in the theories of physics. Nobody can study physics without hearing about these guys. I really doubt they gained any more fame by being on the periodic table, but maybe that's because I don't spend a lot of time looking at the periodic table.\n7. Because the cold war was happening when the elements were discovered, the researchers had to keep quiet about their discovery. Then, once they were announced, they were named after some other guys. Imagine you had discovered a *new element*. A new *fundamental building block of bulk matter*. Wouldn't that situation feel unfair to you?\n8. Elements 99 and 100 was discovered by a team led by Albert Ghiorso, an *enormous* figure in the field of element discovery- directly involved in the discovery of **eleven other elements**. I actually think in all of human history, Ghiorso discovered the most elements. I think his name would be a good replacement and he has more than earned this honor.\n9. A team of fighter pilots literally flew into a freaking mushroom cloud in order to collect the samples. One of them died because no one in the history of human flight had ever flown into conditions produced by the aftermath of a nuclear explosion- \"Robinson hit an area of severe turbulence, spinning out and barely retaining consciousness. He regained control of his plane at 20,000 feet, but the electromagnetic storm had disrupted his instruments... Robinson's F-84 Thunderjet crashed and sank 3.5 miles short of the island. Robinson's body was never recovered.\" We could honor this guy for giving his life to advance science.\n10. We could use this as an opportunity to popularize scientists who aren't white, male, or ultra-popular in an effort to combat disparities, gatekeeping/pretentiousness, and normalize the fact that all scientists are important, and all people can become scientists.\n11. The periodic table is a changing thing by nature, since it represents our expanding knowledge. Historically, it changes each time a new element or group of elements is added, the structure is changed, etc.\n12. It has to be easier than ever in human history to change the name of an element or two while avoiding confusion. Yes, there will be some growing pains (people who really need that perfect periodic table up on their wall might need to buy a new poster), but we live in a world where information travels near instantaneously. Also, we have an international regulatory agency that is responsible for naming elements, so the elements' names wouldn't be in dispute if the agency (IUPAC) changed the names.\n\nThe easiest way to modify my view would be to suggest names better than Ghiorsium (Gh) and Robinsonium (Ro); please explain your reasoning. The more complicated ways to change my view (I think) would be to try to convince me that tradition is more valuable than respect for humans (see 10,11,12), or that we shouldn't change the names because it would be disrespectful to Einstein and Fermi (see 2,4,5,6)",

I am not even claiming that their ideology (or \"ethos\" if you prefer) is bad in anyway - even though I fundamentally disagree with it.\n\nThe only point I am making (and care to defend) is that student unions firstly represent an ideology - not students. In so far as students sign up to the far left social ideology they are represented. Therefore, they should not be called \"student unions\".\n\nAgain, not saying student unions are intentionally bad in any way. They are just not what they say on the tin.\n\nThanks for reading. I may not be able to reply to everyone but will try to read all comments and appreciate any respectful constructive criticism.",

  "selftext": "Okay, about me, I am neither right wing or left wing. I am independent. \n\nJapan has a fat tax, otherwise known as \"Metabo Law\" that fines people between the ages of 40 and 74 for being overweight/obese, but from what I understand, the companies of overweight employees are the ones fined rather than the individuals themselves. When I first read about this, I thought it was completely crazy, but this law has actually worked really well for Japan, and the overall health of Japan on a large scale has actually improved. I think that this could potentially work in the U.S. as well.\n\nNow, I look at some problems in the Untied States. The leading cause of death in the United States is correlated with obesity. To add to that, this can be a HUGE financial burden on the economy. More than 70% of the U.S. population is overweight (according to what I've read), and it seems to only be increasing. \n\nI'm aware of the whole body positivity movement, and I agree that everyone has intrinsic value regardless of their shape/size. At the same time, you cannot argue with health risks that come with being overweight/obese, and with the exception of certain health conditions where weight is out of your control, I do think people have some responsibility to make healthy lifestyle choices.  These choices do not only impact yourself, but everyone else around you whether directly or indirectly, including massive financial stress on the U.S. healthcare system.\n\nI also get that a lot of people (myself included) have high demanding jobs that are relatively low-paying, so it's easier to get fast food and other less healthy but more convenient options. Perhaps, if companies are fined for the weight of their workers, they will take responsibility to either increase wages, educate employees on health, or create a work environment that offers free exercise or healthier food options. I'm sick and tired of only being offered free donuts, cookies, and cake at work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

At this point it's not about liberation anymore but simply retribution. What other choice do Eldians have to ensure their security, but the total destruction of Marley? It's not as if this sentiment is limited to the political elite or a minority of Marleyan society, rather, it is the overwhelming prevailing sentiment. If they limit their attacks to military targets, Marley will just rebuild their strength and attack again.\n\nIf Marley had left them alone in their exile there would have been peace. But instead they wanted vengeance and genocide. When an entire nation want your destruction, the only way to protect yourself is to destroy them first.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily extend to other nations, which are not really explored in the lore. Many of them are definitely prejudiced towards Eldians as well based on the dialogue in the trenches in the final season premiere, but perhaps they are not as aggressive as Marley is. It's not something that's really covered so there's no point to discussing it.

  "selftext": "So based on what I understand of the situation, Ukraine not being a part of NATO has been a big reason why the war in Ukraine has not escalated into something which has spilled out beyond Ukraine.\n\n* Ukraine not being a part of NATO has meant that the rest of NATO (most specifically the US) is not obligated to send troops to fight Russian invaders. Yes the West can still send aid to them, but that's different than direct action of having US troops fighting Russian troops.\n* Ukraine not being NATO has meant that the US cannot put nuclear missiles in Ukraine.\n\nSo this means that Ukraine becoming part of NATO will mean the following:\n\n* US troops WILL be obligated to fight directly against Russian troops. Meaning that the US and Russia will be in open conflict rather than the proxy wars which have defined the post WWII years till today.\n* Ukraine will no longer be a 'buffer zone' between these two massive nuclear superpowers.\n* The US will be able to put nukes in Ukraine.\n\nI think this is going to trigger WWIII, because:\n\n1: It guarantees that US and Russian troops will be in conflict. And as Noam Chomsky once said:  'If the US and Russia ever went to war than that's it. Organized human life as we know it will be over.' (Paraphrase) Obviously he's talking about the deployment of nuclear weapons. (He also said that world peace requires Ukrainian neutrality)\n\n2: Russia \\*cannot\\* allow for, or tolerate, nukes being directly on their boarder. Just like America could NOT tolerate the USSR having nukes in Cuba. This lead to the Cuban missile crisis, which \\*almost\\* resulted in WWIII and an unfathomable amount of death.\n\nSo if Ukraine joins NATO we are guaranteed to have a Ukrainian missile crisis in the near future. And this time who knows? It might not go the other way and means we'd be leaving the fate of the human race up to a dice roll.\n\nSo yeah guys. If this happens I think we are all going to die very soon.",

I can completely understand that people may not like how it feels to have birth privilege in our democracy, but I feel that the economic and diplomatic benefits far outweighs this.\n\nAs I understand it, the uk monarchy owns the crown estate, which owns many of the parks and lots of land in the uk. 25% of the profits are kept by the monarchy, 75% are given to the British government. There is some deviation year on year but generally it is the case that the uk monarch gives 75% of their earnings from their private property to the government. \n\nUnless we disagree on the fundamental idea of owning private property, surely this is a benefit to the UK?\n\nI guess my view is based on two key assumptions: we assume that private property cannot be seized, and that the economics of the monarchy is more important than the ‘fairness’ aspect.\n\nEDIT: after reading many of the fair comments, I have accepted that the monarchy is at cost to the taxpayer, to the tune of about £86M a year.

The author is a Princeton educated black American woman.

And I thought “wow, that’s not a statement you hear from a lot of other academics in other countries.”\n\nEven postcolonial feminists, while debating laws that limit a woman’s very right to exist as an independent adult, Algeria for example, would never say that their country isn’t worth saving. They’d never even contemplate it. And even criticizing things like marital rape, polygyny or institutionalized sexism that deprives women of agency or autonomy are always very careful to in their words to avoid generalizations in their works and to respect “traditional” cultures. \n\nYet time and time again we see literature pushed out by colleges and universities in America attempting to “debunk” America and its “myths”. Take the 1619 Project for example or works by a historian like Roxanne Dunbar Ortiz who seeks to expose America for the fraud it is when it comes to our story as a “nation of immigrants”.

  "selftext": "I’m a young adult in my late twenties and believe that retirement is overrated for multiple reasons.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, I think saving money for a day where you’re too ill to work is a good idea. I don’t think saving up money for a retirement is overrated. This is not the idea I’m disputing. Rather, I think the idea of retirement, as in when you stop working at 65 so you can have free time to do things you want, is overrated. \n\n1. I would rather live my life to the fullest while I’m young rather than wait to actually start living my life when I’m old. I think a more balanced approach of taking sabbaticals every few years to focus on some other projects and goals outside of work sounds a lot more reasonable. \n\n2. The future is never promised. To save up money and work my ass off for 50+ years just to die right after I retire would be such a waste. Not to mention I’m not very hopeful about the future of our planet with climate change and who knows if I’ll even live into my 50s. I just think the idea of postponing your most burning passions and projects to a later time far out in the future is too optimistic, because tomorrow is never promised. You could die any day.\n\n3. I don’t think there will ever come a day where I find myself not wanting to do some form of work. I’m an extrovert, I love going out into the world and seeing and connecting with people. Work is a major part of maintaining my social life and feeling apart of my community. So I still imagine myself working in my old age. \n\n4. I think that living a lifestyle that is sustainable (that you can maintain over time) is more important than making \na ton of money now so you can have a ton of free time later. Instead I would rather save a *some* money now and have *some* free time now. This means I live a modest life, keep my expenses in check, and still manage to put a little money into savings. And then I can maintain that through my entire life. Besides most people have to downgrade their lifestyle when they retire because they won’t be making as much money from their pension as when they were working. \n\n5. Surely there is the counter argument of needing sufficient savings for old age because I may get ill and be physically or mentally unable to work. But if I am no longer able to work, I think that is when I would lean on my retirement savings and government programs like CPP and OAS (I live in Canada for context). Plus if my health deteriorates too much I think I would honestly just rather die than be so unwell that I can’t even work.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I hate work just as much as the next person and only want to work as much as I need to sustain myself. But I just feel it is more reasonable and sustainable to spread my “retirement years” over the entire span of my life through sabbaticals and time off work rather than saving up all this free time in hopes to use it when I turn 65+",

  "selftext": "I have not seen any statistical data on this so if you know of anything trustworthy, please share.\n\nI would really like for my view to be changed but I feel like this is something inherent to human nature and I can't let up. Most people seem to have kids for the wrong reasons:\n\n1. **They want someone to care for them when they are old** meaning they have not planned far enough ahead past retirement and need to rely on kids for transportation and care (they are too insolvent to have kids AND live life)\n2. **They want others to care about them** It is easier to get a partner to care or even the government to care about you if you have kids. Because denying them essentials or pleasures will also impact their kids, people don't want to make the parent upset and in return also give this innocent kid a bad life.\n3. **They want to have the pregnancy experience** This applies mostly only to women and admittedly I would fall in this group. Pregnancy gives you new t\\*ts and seems magical from the outside. It also tends to reduce cancers and mothers tend to live longer (even if that is only because their kids 'need' them?) So there are medical reasons it might seem good to have kids that have nothing to do with wanting to be a parent.\n4. **They want to pass on their genes** This would be closer to the male side of 'wanting the experience' as men are rumored to be biologically hardwired to want to spread their seed without any possible rationality behind what might happen next. Throw cleavage in their face and they practically become imbeciles. Again, it has absolutely nothing to do with parenthood; it can't: because it's immediate, disarming and short-sighted.\n\nI really feel that the way society is set up right now is making it so that health and livelihood in old age is dependent on having kids. Be it genetic or not, this just doesn't seem like a good premise for wanting to be a good parent. Anyone who has been parentified by their own parents can probably agree: who would actually be dumb enough to want to be forced to raise their own kids after raising their parents? No one asks to be born and parenting is a lifelong commitment to teaching and therefore being frustrated. Kids outsmart parents, go around their backs, and are generally born completely uncivilized. And on top of that, not only do you need to dedicate the rest of your life to teaching them but if you make a mistake it could get magnified over time.\n\nSo if it is so hard to raise kids and takes away time from our ability to care for ourselves in old age, perhaps it is better to not try raising them at all: let society correct them or send them away to a private school. Because all the time wasted on trying to secure their wellbeing seems to eat away at time which could be spent making money to ensure the parents are safe and cared for in retirement instead of kids having to 'return the favor'\n\nNo one asks to be born so no one should have to 'return the favor' of being raised",

  "selftext": "I am speaking out as an American citizen but I noticed that due to the influence of the Internet, more people are being swayed by social change movements and intergovernmental organizations like the World Health Organization and the United Nations. I noticed that things like diversity, inclusion, and equity are being promoted with the goal of a unified one-world culture and government where people in current African countries, the Middle East, and parts of central and east Asia could enjoy the same constitutional rights and liberties as US citizens.\n\nProponents of a one-world state argue that among other things, a one-world nation can defend more rights, freedoms, and opportunities for more of the global population than having numerous nations with various wealth and income disparities. Also in speaking of income and wealth disparity, unification of the worlds nations can alleviate economic inequality more effectively and productively through more targeted efforts of income and wealth redistribution. In addition, a one world currency that goes a step further than the regional euro currency would \"level the playing field\" for currency use and international trade.\n\nWhile a one-world nation sounds nice and all, the idea of a one-world culture and nation sounds like a scary precedent for an abuse of power. I also notice that conservatives tend to be more nationalist and isolationist whereas liberals and progressives tend to be more embracing of globalization and a unified state and culture. With a one-world nation, tyranny becomes more likely through a one-world government having more control over social liberties than a smaller national superpower like the current USA.\n\nI have no issues with supporting women, racial/ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities in terms of providing equal access and freedom from marginalization and discrimination. I also have no issue with the transition to a \"cashless society\" as long as individual privacy rights are preserved through government regulation. What I am against is any trend or movement that brings us closer to a one-world unified government and culture. I think there is a need to maintain cultural heterogeneity and diversity as well as having separate nations.\n\nIf NGOs like the UN and WHO want to ensure universal human rights are applied to all member states, they can **and did** create a universal declaration of human rights and support initiatives to promote, life, liberty, property rights, and equal opportunity for all human citizens without the need of a one-world unified government and culture. The concern is less of cultural unification and more of potential tyranny that comes from a powerful one-world state.",

Now first I’d like to say rest in piece to Chadwick Boseman he was a phenomenal actor and I miss him so much. Starting off with the fact by killing off Tchalla it’s totally disrespectful towards the performance of the late great Chadwick Boseman because all of his years of brilliant acting was axed like nothing.\n\nSecondly there’s hardly any black male superheroes in the MCU that young black boys who are fans of the franchise can look up to.The only ones who exists are War Machine, Sam Wilson who is now Captain America and Luke Cage. I know there are other black male superheroes who will eventually come like Blue Marvel but by eliminating Tchalla is reducing the very small pool.\n\nTchalla is very prominent and monumental hero in the comics and has amazing stories and arcs in the comic universe that can be well adapted into the silver screen. However since Tchalla has been killed we will never see those stories and adapted it was a total slap in the face to the character.\n\nHis son who came at the end of the movie is literally gonna be a fatherless child in the MCU a lot of black children growing up as fatherless children we don’t need to see that in the movies.\n\nIt’s utter ludicrous when people say Tchalla shouldn’t be recasted when Cassie Lang in the MCU got recasted three times. \n\nChadwick relatives such as his brother said that they preferred if the character was recasted. \n\nI genuinely believe that Tchalla should have been recasted I invite anyone to change my view.",

  "selftext": "When talking and thinking about the discussion of All Lives Matter (ALM) vs Black Lives Matter (BLM), I've come to a conclusion and would like to hear others' thoughts.\n\n**Here is a basic overview of what I believe**\n\n* BLM misses ALM's message of \"all lives genuinely matter,\" and instead pin ALM as a white supremacist group\n* ALM misses BLM's message of \"all lives genuinely matter,\" and instead pin BLM as a riot/terrorism/reverse-racist group\n* The misconstruing of messages may or may not be intentional. I can't say for sure whether misrepresenting ALM or BLM is a strategic/planned move by smart politicians, or if it is just a product of the 24-hour news cycle, doomscrolling, and twitter arguments.\n* At the end of the day, BLM and ALM both fundamentally believe that all lives should matter equally. While both sides agree, they hate each other largely due to party lines and/or other cultural differences.\n* I acknowledge that both sides have those that will weaponize their cause. BLM absolutely has some opportunistic looters and reverse-racists. ALM absolutely has some racists and people that want to destroy the BLM movement. I believe that neither of these groups make up a majority of their respective movement. We ought to evaluate movements based on the majority of their constituents, not the minority causing trouble. The weaponizing minority (that commit crimes) should be arrested and put in trial just like any other criminal would be.\n* I believe it is almost certainly true that ALM was made as a reaction to the growing BLM movement. Still though, I think the intentions were pure: to create more inclusive language. Has it since been utilized to put down the BLM movement? Definitely, but my CMV is not about how damaging either side has actually been. Rather, it is about the fact that both of these movements actually agree and that the difference is just semantics.\n\n**How I came to this view**\n\nJust to get any personal biases out of the way, I am a member of GenZ in the USA, and I would consider myself on the left of the political spectrum.\n\nBased on the discourse I see between right and left, it seems that both sides say the same thing: All lives matter equally. And yet, both sides paint each other as horrible movements that are trying to put down others and/or cause crime. My brain can't fully process this clear mismatch, so I've largely chalked it up to the continuing division between left and right (which is a CMV for another day).\n\nWhen Vivek said on the GOP debate stage, I found his statement that \"reverse racism IS racism\" as a super interesting illustration of this notion. It is leveraging the fact that BLM is portrayed as a movement that supports minorities \\*\\*over\\*\\* the oppressors, or the whites. Vivek is alluding to the notion that BLM (or perhaps the left as a whole) is supportive of or at least indifferent to racism towards white people. Yet, every time I bring this up to a leftist, they make it very clear that \"No, BLM is about all races being equal. Not about putting down white people.\" I have yet to find a single person who genuinely believes reverse racism is okay, BLM or not. And while I'm sure they exist, my argument is that this is a minority that inappropriately weaponizes the movement. If someone weaponizes the movement to put down whites, they should not be a part of BLM since they clearly missed the point.\n\nSimilarly, if I even think of bringing this argument up to a BLM supporter, I know I would get grilled for it. The moment I utter the words \"ALM has a point, common ground can be made\" the rest of my sentence would likely get grilled for it. I believe this is because the left seems to have painted ALM as a violent white supremacist movement. While there are almost certainly white supremacists that support ALM, I would also argue these people make up a minority and are unfairly weaponizing the movement to advance their own personal racist views. When speaking to my right-wing friends, their issues with BLM always come down to blocking roads, looting towns, and other crime. When it does involve race, it is usually the common misunderstanding that \"BLM is reverse racist and wants minorities to be above historic oppressors.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, these two movements are saying the exact thing. Every life matters the same amount, no matter the color of your skin.\n\nThat is my set of experiences that led me to come to my conclusion. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to further elaborate on my view. Thanks for reading, now change my view!\n\n**EDIT**\n\nHeading out, and my view is definitely changed! There were a ton of comments and I can't respond to them all, sorry if I didn't get around to yours.

  "title": "CMV: Using ChatGPT for academic purposes is not an academic integrity violation, educational spaces shouldn’t ban the use of it.",
  "selftext": "The title should me more along the lines of “higher education spaces shouldn’t ban the use of ChatGPT.”\n\n\nI’ve thought about it hard and long, and have come to the conclusion that using artificial intelligence in research papers, essays or something along the lines is completely ethical and reasonable.\n\n\nLet me start off with the pros:\n\n- Efficiency. ChatGPT basically has all information up until 2021, it saves so much time instead of going to the search engine and clicking on links one after another until you find something useful for your papers. It lays all the information in a sophisticated and organised manner that is easy to work with.\n\n- Time saving: pretty self explanatory, you don’t need to spend hours and hours looking for relevant information.\n\n- Helpful. ChatGPT can enhance your research papers, be it grammar wise, structure, clarity, factual and etc.. \n\n- Money saving. You don’t need paid language services such as grammerly to spot the mistakes anymore.\n\n- Inspirational. Depending on which topic you want to talk about, ChatGPT can give ideas, dive deep into them and spark inspiration within you. \n\n\nNow with the cons:\n\n- Students may use it to have their essays be written for them without putting in effort, claiming it as their own.\n\n- The tool can make factual errors, as I said it has information up until 2021.\n\n- Occasional plagiarism. This one can be talked about deeper. I’ve heard of cases that teachers have found the AI’s writings to be extremely plagiarised, but there are other studies that show that it’s completely void of plagiarism.\n\n— Can be biased. The tool has a lot of stored data from many sources, many of  which can contain biases or prejudice.\n\nDespite the cons, using the actual tool shouldn’t be banned because the pros outweigh the cons, not to mention that we live in the future. Soon this technology along with many others will be normalised. Basically, calculators will happen all over again. Educators banned the use of calculators because they deemed it as cheating, only for it to be the norm nowadays. I predict same thing will happen with AI tools. Also, just like calculators, people with high education who already know the formulas, are allowed to use calculators, since the hard parts of learning the basics of maths has become easy and tedious to them. This could apply in the same sense of using ChatGPT, people with higher education that already know how to form a well structured essay or paper shouldn’t not be allowed to use the tool.\n\n\nNow with the refutations of the con points:\n\n- “Students use it to cheat.” Although students can use it to generate essays and papers and claim it as their own, OpenAI, same developers of ChatGPT, have created counter AIs to spot if something was AI written or human written.\n\nSome may say that people can evade the system by using paraphrasing tools such as quillbot to get under the radar. And while I agree, advanced cheating has always been a thing. People are willing to get smart to get that full mark, but teachers can solve this issue by asking for early drafts, and explanations of why they changed some things. \n\n- Incorrect facts laid by the AI. This problem, alongside the biased information of the AI falls under the responsibility of the student. Students should naturally fact check their information, a simple search in google scholar (or even normal google if it was a simple paper) will clear out the false information. \n\n- Plagiarism has always been a problem in education, but that again, falls under the responsibility of the student. If the student is dumb enough to get caught.. well, you reap what you sow. But in my opinion, the correct way of using ChatGPT in an ethical manner is by using it as a resource instead of a writing tool. For example copy-pasting your already existing essay to the chat and asking it to suggest edits or fix issues with clarity and grammar. It can be used to enhance your writing and even allow the student to learn new ways of phrasing things or organising their work. Cheating by definition is the act of lying in order to take advantage, by Disclosing that you used and referenced a helping tool contradicts the definitions of cheating; since you were honest and fair.\n\nThus, it shouldn’t be banned in educational spaces. It good to learn about technology early and embrace it; we are living in the future.\n\n\n..but I’m open to hearing different opinions. Let me know what you think?\n\n\nEdit: I want to say that I don’t condone full on copy-pasting generated essays-papers, that is plagiarism.",

  "title": "CMV: It is correct to include suicides in firearm death statistics.",
  "selftext": "Some people argue that it is disingenuous to include suicides in firearm deaths with something along the lines of it being \"padding the numbers.\" They believe that only homicide should be included in firearm death statistics when discussing gun control. I disagree.\n\nFirearms can be used for hunting and for sport/recreation, but much of the argument around gun control--especially the debate about the 2nd amendment in the US--centers on the use of firearms for one's defense. Defense against criminals and a potentially evil government. If guns are such a valuable object because of defense, then all instances where they do the opposite should be considered, including suicide.\n\n[The research shows that the risk of successful suicide increases when one lives in a home with a firearm.](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/risk/) (As an aside, a person's risk of dying by way of homicide [also increases if they live in a house with a firearm](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8371731/).) The reasons for increased success rate of suicide seem obvious. Every second that passes for a person experiencing suicidal ideation is a chance that they decide against suicide, so a method that is potentially very quick to perform, such as self-inflicted gunshot, leaves fewer chances for reconsideration than a method that takes more preparation, such as hanging or jumping from a structure. This is combined with the fact that survivability for self-inflicted gunshots is lower than many other methods for suicide. The result is that, for people who experience suicidal ideation, their chance of survival decreases when a firearm is present.\n\nIn a country like the US that is experiencing a serious mental health crisis, why wouldn't we include suicides in firearm death statistics?",

  "selftext": "Anyone here ever seen a bike actually stop at a stop sign? Yeah me neither. Ever seen a bike take up an entire lane of traffic? Like, all the time? Yeah me too!\n\nBicyclists are clearly establishing a double-standard for themselves, where they can follow some traffic laws and demand that other vehicles in the vicinity respect that while just eschewing the ones that are inconvenient for them, like having to actually stop at a stop sign.\n\nIf you ever saw a car blow through a stop sign because \"there doesn't appear to be a need to actually stop there\", you'd be very concerned, if not pissed off about it. And if you ever saw a car driving down the sidewalk, you'd probably not be too happy about that either! I say this second part because while I obviously think the former is a problem, the latter is also not exactly the right solution, nor should it really be something bicyclists ought to do if they want to be respected on the road.\n\nThis attitude is obviously very dangerous for the bicyclist, but it is dangerous for everyone on the road also. If you have to slam on the brakes because a bicyclist instantaneously transformed into a pedestrian for a few seconds as he cruised through that stop sign intersection, that could cause a collision with any of the cars around you. When bicyclists don't respect traffic laws, it is impossible to predict what they will be doing, and having to \"guess\" at what any vehicle on the road is doing is clearly going to cause a lot of accidents.\n\nI think bicyclists need to decide one way or the other: are you a road vehicle or a pedestrian? And whichever you choose, you gotta keep to that, 100% of the time. If you choose to be a pedestrian, then you don't get to take up an entire lane of traffic or have any cars have to respect your presence on the road; you being on the road would be as much of a concern as me walking down the road and getting in the way of other cars. And if you choose to be a road vehicle, that means you actually fucking stop at a fucking stop sign, because that's what road vehicles are supposed to do. You get one or the other. You don't get both, especially not when *you feel like it.*\n\nCMV.\n\nEdit: a point I would like to make: I was referring to people treating stop signs as NON-EXISTENT, not as yield signs. Many of you have strawmanned my view and said it is irrational to not allow them to be regarded as yield signs, but my view has to do with them treating them as non-existent signs. The conversation of whether stop signs ought to be regarded as yield signs is different. At the very least, if you want to get through to me, you have to approach this fully understanding my view and not strawmanning it. Because it is easier to dunk on the view if you think my problem is with bikers taking SOME precautions, isn't it? And my problem is with the ones who take NONE, which is what makes the \"why aren't you okay with them treating it as a yield sign?\" angle a strawman.",

Not in a \"I can't get my words out right\" but more in a \"I have never critically engaged with this before\" way. \n\nMost times it is better to say how these privledges came about, and how they are upheld still. If you're talking about areas where women are overlooked for men, we should be able to say what advantages, either socially or physically, do men generally have over women. \n\nFor example, women are more terrified of seeing a man at night rather than a woman. Let's analyze why. In the US the average male height is 5'9\" while women are on average 5'4\". Male puberty give me more power on average. If someone both bigger and stronger then you come from no where at night, everyone is getting scared. It's not a fear of men, but it's the fear of being overpowered. Taller and bigger people usually don't have to worry about this much. It's why more work worry about this than men. \n\nSecond example, in the work place men will seemingly be picked over women. The system for working before disenfranchised women from joining even after women started to gain equality. Joining a space made for a group is daunting as an outsider. This space was created from people who didn't knowingly create a male space but simply enforced it.\n\nWomen are smaller and less aggressive socially. Even if you want to be more aggressive, there is only so much room you can move in being an outsider. CEOs aren't juet mostly emn but they're taller on average. Smaller and shorter people on average don't made as much money as taller people. On average, men will benefit from natural selection of these traits. Men are taught to be more aggressive, straight forward, and they are physically call for more respect. None of this is due to men as group being evil. Men do benefit from this generally on average. \n\nBoth of those are to show examples of how to discuss contentious ideas such as \"cross the street when men\" or \"men don't face struggle in the working world.\" I tried to look at what is fundamentally being said. I think this is the best way to do so. There are examples where these average benefits harm men. Home care, child care, and health care are all examples of where men will face discrimination. \n\nI see a lot of men irl and online weary of feminism. They'll have a knee-jerk reaction to these two topics. I aim to lower that by understanding what is fundamentally being said and hoping to express that clearly. \n\nWays to change my view:\n\nSome suggestions but I'm sure there are more. I consider these fundamental pillars in my argument. If you make me agree to any of these, it would fundamentally change my view. \n\n1. I'm actually wrong in my description of male privledge and showing me how I am wrong\n\n2. This isn't an issue that impedes understanding of the topic. Showing something that is a bigger issue that impedes gaining more support \n\n3. It ain't better to say how or why privledges happen. Simply stating they are so should be enough",

It is common knowledge that for universities like Harvard and Standford, legacy admissions plays a major role in admissions. It's not uncommon for someone with lower GPA and other holistic metrics to get if they are legacy applicants.\n\nThere is a strong likelihood that legacy admits drastically outnumbers Affirmative Action admits, and likely also has lower GPA's than Affirmative Action admits.\n\nThe sheer fact that people are focusing on Affirmative Action rather than legacy showcases that US has learned absolutely nothing about race.\n\nOne of the largest anti-Affirmative Actions groups have consistently been Asians. Asians have frequently been an ally, co-conspirator, or unwilling beneficiary to anti-black anti-diversity campaigns since the 1960's through anti-Civil Rights Model Minority campaigns. The fact that many activist groups have not recognized the weaponization of the Model Minority stereotype to push the initiative is worrying. \n\nAnti-Affirmative Action activists had white and asian students front page on news outs complaining about or bashing Affirmative Action. Not unlike the 1960's.\n\nWhy is Affirmative Action made in the first place? Because African Americans literally weren't allowed to even compete academically in many educational institutions and everything else around Jim Crow policies. Affirmative Action is still needed precisely because primary schools in black communities are notoriously under-funded, thus decreasing the amount of quality applicants to elite universities.\n\nNot addressing this fact, not addressing that legacy applicants outnumbers AA applicants really does show that we have really learned nothing regarding race.

The idea of going back to that status quo seems baffling. If anything, it's the calculus Hamas counted on based on previous fighting  (i.e Hamas and Israel slowly escalate, then world opinion convinces Israel that a ceasefire is the best approach).\n\nDuring a recent interview, a Hamas leader boasted that the last 2 years Hamas strategically limited engagement with Israel as to convince them that they actually cared about \"governing the people in Gaza.\" In reality, they used the 2 years to plan the massacre.\n\n It's reasonable to ascertain that a ceasefire would just give Hamas what they want and time to regroup. \n\nKeep in mind - Another Hamas leader recently said that the \"October 7 massacre will happen 'again and again' until Israel is 'annihilated.\"\n\nIs this the type of group you make a ceasefire with? How do you engage in negotiations in good faith with a group whose sworn reason for existence is destruction and murder.

The old is said to be mote capable due to their experience, however, they are stuck in an outdated mindset that doesn’t adapt well to the current society. This created a culture of conservatism where societal development is slower than in other regions.\n\nAsian families are also quite authoritarian and see their children as extensions of themselves instead of another human being. Thus, they try to control their children’s life into being tools to strengthen the family. This type of authoritarian parenting leads to low esteem, poor critical thinking skills, and low self-value. These are all negative traits brought by Asian authoritarian parenting.\n\nAsian society values societal conformity in which everyone is expected to follow the norms of the society. This leads to a lack of diversity and creativity as everyone seeks to be the standard of society instead of something different.\n\nAsian culture is also extremely hierarchical and many people seek to exploit the benefits they have. Bosses often force their employees to work overtime for little pay so they could gain more profits. If they don’t do so, the employees will be fired. Parents often force their kids to be moulded into what they want their children to be like. If they don’t do so, there’s the threat of abandonment. As opposed to Western companies and families, their employees and children enjoy more social freedoms.\n\nAsian education is also extremely poor. It focuses on memorization to solve tests rather than creativity and logic which could be used in real life scenarios unlike the things you have to remember for the tests. The reason why so many Asians go to the West for education is because Asian education sucks and is backwards. South Korean and Japanese education is also like this and this is inexcusable since these countries are as rich as European ones.\n\nOverall, although there are many merits in Asian culture such as the artistic value, the mythology, the fashion, etc. I feel like Asian social values are inferior to Western values due to the fact that there are more social freedoms in Western culture and less in Asian culture.\n\nI am saying this as a Mainland Asian (who lives in an Asian country).

Any media that sells porn will start selling tabboo porn because it will make them more money\n\nEnter pornhub and you will see titles that sound something like this on the main page which means you will not have to even search for these:\n\n-A woman stuck somewhere (normalization of rape)\n-Stepsis fucked (normalization of incest)\n-The holes of sluts get destroyed (normalization of misogyny)\n\nNow, an adult would know that these videos are fake but I and nobody I know has started watching porn after they were 18, it was almost always around 10 years and while unfortunate a lot of 10 year olds could see all these videos and start believing that is how people behave and act when it comes to sex that they mighr try it in real life and that is very problematic because we will have a portion of women and men who will think that the way pornhub promotes sex is the normal thing\nAnd the problem is, what pornhub cares about is money and just like youtube they need a lot of people to stay and click on the vids which will not happen if every video is titled 2 people have ordinary sex and those more tabboo will get more views and more watch rate which will make people who make porn do more of those videos and then they would be the ones that are normal to watch and  people will suffer\n\n2. Does the opposite of help to mentally ill people\n\nThere has been research done where they showed that actually watching porn would decrease your prefrontal cortex (logical part of the brain) and increase your amygdala (your fight or flight response), now someone who has anxiety or trauma related mental problems can use porn and masturbation as a form of coping but by doing so they are making their anxiety and trauma worse by increasing what causes it and decreasing what would slow it down\n\nAnd the more hatefull mental illnesses like narcissists, psychopaths, people with anger isuue etc can easily find porn that helps soothe what they are looking for which not only makes them think that it is ok to feel the need to put others down but rather they would be reward with sexual pleasures, and just look how many messed up sadistic porn subreddits are and that js only on reddit\n\nNot to mention the additional possibility of another mental illness and that being addicted to porn\n\nSo porn only adds fuel to the fire when it comes to mentally ill people\n\n3. Crime\n\nWomen getting raped, human trafficking are quite common in porn conpanies and are heavily advised and scared of to not talk about it, even pornhub the biggest porn platform had to remove so many videos last year because of how rapey they are and some (just like many platforms) included underaged teenagers into the mix. The thing is that the people who work in such places breed in sexually sadistic and masochistic people and with that , the dynamics will always have people who are very rapey and like to control others\n\n4. Normalization of rape, misogyny and others\n\nThings feel normal to a person once they are expose to such same things a lot and i said porn companies will always give tabboo titles more time to glow which means when you open them, you will be more and more in the mindset that the titles you see are normal behavior (especially if you are a young person)\n\n5. It's misinformation about sexual education \n\nCondoms are almost never used, it is almost never showed that they cleaned their asses before doing anal, they keep showing women putting big things in their pussy that might tear some tissues, a lot of creampies happen and somehow no one gets pregnant, the way the woman moan when absolutely nothing is being done to them and a lot of stuff.",

  "title": "CMV: Abortion is immoral because it is erasing a potential life",
  "selftext": "To preface, I’m heavily pro-choice in every case. I support fully legalized abortions for any reason, not just in the case of rape, incest, or danger to the fetus or carrier. This is for a few different reasons, I believe nobody should be forced to undergo extreme changes to their body and literally give their sustenance and bones and blood to something they do not want, speaking as a woman it’s horrifying to even imagine that because to me it seems like being forced to sustain a parasite. I believe in full bodily autonomy when it comes to these kinds of medical decisions. I think it is disgusting to force somebody to carry to term against their will. I am also from a country that completely bans abortions, and the statistics for deaths from “homemade” (unlicensed, unsafe) abortions are awful. It is my firm belief that abortion should be accessible regardless of circumstances.\n\nHowever, I often find the argument that abortion is “murder” because it is erasing a potential life, and while I disagree with the word murder, I can’t convince myself that abortion is not immoral on some level. To be clear, this in no way changes my pro-choice stance, nor will it ever. But I can’t think of an argument against this sort of ideology, and since I can’t disprove it, I find myself agreeing with it.\n\nI only think this applies in cases that aren’t related to rape, incest, danger to either party, etc. This is because in cases of rape/incest, I understand that severe trauma can result from carrying to term, and in the case of unsafe pregnancy, it doesn’t make sense to me to damage or lose both lives when one life (the mother’s) could still be saved. I acknowledge that trauma occurs regardless, but I feel that it is much more severe in some circumstances. Thinking about it now, I’m wondering why exactly I think this. What level of trauma makes taking a potential life okay? I guess it would have to be life ruining trauma as a result of not getting an abortion. I see things as very one to one, a life for a life if that makes sense. I don’t think people who get abortions are immoral, either. I don’t think they should be shamed. Again, I just can’t disprove to myself that abortion itself is immoral because it takes a potential (human) life.\n\nHere are things that I don’t think would change my view:\n\n“The fetus did not consent to being born.” Neither did the entire human species. And since when should children be held responsible for important decisions, let alone ones that can’t even properly think? On this same line of logic,\n\n“The potential life is not worth more than the mother’s suffering.” I agree. That is why I am pro-choice. This does not mean it is moral. Just that is it acceptable and justifiable.\n\nAny variation of “but the kid could grow up and be suicidal/wish they weren’t alive and hadn’t been born.” Most people are not suicidal.\n\n“But raising children is xyz.” I’m not advocating for the mother to raise the kid. Adoption is an option, as horrible as the foster care system is.\n\n“But the foster care system is xyz.” I know. But I believe a less than ideal life is better than no shot at life in the first place. \n\n“You can’t be pro-choice is you think abortion is immoral.” I disagree. I am firmly pro abortion access, that will not change.\n\nSomething I think could change my view is examples of other procedures that remove a potential human life (for reasons other than the safety of the carrier). Other than that, I don’t know. If I could change my own view, I would. I don’t like having this opinion. Let me know if clarification is required or if this is a rule breaking post.\n\nEdited to add clarification: I do not believe human life begins at conception. Or at heartbeat. Or at any of those miscellaneous milestones. My view is strictly about the future potential for life.\n\nEdit 2: My views have changed pretty significantly! I’d appreciate if new commenters would read the delta log before commenting, I don’t want to try and defend/argue in favor of something I no longer believe. But I’m very much open to questions about why I believed that, as long as there is acknowledgment that I no longer think that way",

  "selftext": "I've held this opinion for a while and am curious if there are some ways to think about these kinds of rights (henceforth called Natural Rights for simplicity) in a coherent and meaningful way. A lot has been written about them and I haven't read most of it.\n\nWhen people talk about rights, they're typically talking about one of several different things. I'll focus on legal rights and \"natural rights\". Legal rights arise out of a legal and political process and can be said to meaningfully exist. No problem there.\n\nMy contention is that \"natural rights\" are not meaningfully different from a completely subjective and personal opinion about what people should be able to do. When people say that people right to abortion, or guns, or free speech, or healthcare, there is no meaningful difference between that and saying \"I personally believe that people should be able to do/have these things.\"\n\nSometimes people will appeal to a state of nature where people were able to do these things and anything they naturally do is a natural right. This is inconsistent with how actually people talk about rights because no one says people have a right to murder, steal, etc, even though those things are natural to humans. What natural human behaviors qualify as \"rights\" is completely a matter of subjective opinion and is not based on any objective \"natural state.\" For a solid example of this, enslavement of others as property has been considered a natural right... until it wasn't. The reason for that change was because people's opinions on the acceptability of that practice changed. Primitive societies did not and do not recognize the same set of rights that we do today.\n\nSometimes people will appeal to empathy or human well-being or some utilitarian cause. Those are reasons for your subjective opinion, they do not translate to natural rights.\n\nCan provide something that they think is a fundamental natural right, but is *not* something that they personally think people should be allowed to do or have?\n\nWhen people say things like \"Constitutional rights are based on natural rights\", all that means is \"Constitutional rights are based on what people think should be allowed.\" Specifically in this case the people who drafted and ratified those amendments. I don't think there is anything wrong with that at all, but people want to believe that laws are based on something more solid than the opinions of people, and that is simply not the case.\n\nFor the religious, I can imagine a case for God-given rights specifically in the case of religious adherence.

  "title": "CMV: All preachers who advocate for pro life are bad people",
  "selftext": "well, as it was correctly pointed out to me, not all preachers are bad, so the new title would be: \n#most preachers who advocate for pro life are bad and it is quite difficult without assumptions of abstract personalities to indicate an example of a good preacher\n\nI'll start with a little anecdote. \n\nFrom time to time I kill time by watching shorts on YouTube. Lately I've come across a lot of anti-abortion content. This is usually done by preachers, who most often say that a homosapien embryo is a homosapien and killing a homosapien is an objectively bad action (there is no need to explain that since a person believes in God, he is a moral realist(correct me if I’m wrong)). Since I am a nominalist, I think that the homosapiens argument is not something solid, because (yes, maybe someone might take this to mean that I am a disgusting person) I don’t think that anything without a brain can be considered a person. But still, I’m interested in another point in the thoughts of these preachers and the people who argue with them, I don’t understand why I haven’t come across a situation where these preachers were asked the question that I’m going to ask in this post. Perhaps one of you will point out where exactly I am wrong. \n\nThe point is that if morality is objective (for now let’s ignore the fact that even if it is objective, and there are moral laws, you can always simply say: so what? It turns out I’m violating a moral law huh so? (for example, the same will not happen with some physical fact - you will always break yourself if you go out the window from the 25th floor and fall on the asphalt, while you always have the possibility of killing a person even if it violates the moral law) then you probably (preachers say so) are obliged to strive to live in accordance with these moral laws. And now the most interesting part begins: we have premises: 1. if you see a child (let’s add tension since most value the lives of children most of all, it seems to me) drowning in the river and you pass by without doing anything, then you are a bad person (on an intuitive level, it seems to me that most moral realist(and all these preachers) would agree with this statement.) 2. If, by saving this child, for example, you don’t make it to work and don’t earn a certain amount of money and don’t have lunch because of this in a restaurant and don’t cook from the cheapest ingredients to feed yourself, you will do the right thing, it is intuitively obvious for me that if you do otherwise you are committing a terrible act considering the fact that you are a moral realist. 3. Living in the era of awareness, we know that every day a certain number of people die due to hunger, we know that there are a large number of different funds that help these starving people. 4. When you buy any food in a restaurant, you buy a product that is more expensive, although it may be of higher quality than the cheapest one on the market, you are actually choosing not to save a person but just to go to work. 5. You are a bad person according to your own system of objective morality which you are obliged to adhere to. What can you answer to this? What am I wrong about here, if I am wrong and how should such a question be answered, for example, by these preachers or how would you answer it? \n\nP.S. Of course, it is worth adding that I realize that it is not at all important who the person is who makes any statement purporting to be true or false for the fact of the truth or falsity of that statement. The fact that preachers are bad according to their own moral system cannot affect whether their statements regarding abortion are true or false with the premises they introduce according to their moral “facts.” But in any case, this can act as self-defense and a way of humbling such preachers.\n\nP.P.S. Everything I've written can be extended to a larger number of people - most of all moral realists. But I'm interested in those who shout the most - these preachers, so the main target is them\n\nP.P.P.S. English isn’t my native language so if you have so questions which can appear due to misunderstandings what I meant feel free to ask me and I’ll elaborate.\n\n\n\nI have to edit my post and add one important piece: I acknowledge that there can be moral realists who think that passing by drowning child isn’t bad. I just intuitively assume that it is the minority of all moral realists and for sure the minority of all preachers ",

I agree with that fact but disagree with the conclusion, since labour has involved sacrificing your time I don't see it as somehow \"fair\" that labour should be taxed at a higher rate.\n\nWhat this two-tier system has created is a financial system that allows the wealthy to pay a much lower percentage of their total income in tax because it's a \"different type\" of income. I'm tired of reading about how multi-millionaires pay some tiny proportion of their income in tax because they're able to somehow move their money over to a different income stream when people that live in London and are struggling to break into the middle class are well into the 40% tax bracket. If we bring this back to Marx's class system, the upper classes and bourgeoisie are explicitly given preferential treatment over the working class.\n\nThe set up I think we should have is that there's a tax free allowance for each of the income streams (labour, investments, savings interest) but anything that goes over these allowances is considered taxable income and goes into the same pot to be taxed at the same rate.",

  "selftext": "I’m saying this from the perspective of a 22 year old who recently gave up on dating earlier this year and feels so much better for it.\n\nDating for most people isn’t easy but it feels natural. You meet people naturally, attraction grows naturally, you don’t have to manufacture chemistry etc. This is true for a lot of people, but it’s also completely untrue for some, especially for a lot of young men. Standards for dating have changed in the last decade in a way that excludes a portion of the male population to the point where giving up is the best choice.\n\nAttempting to date causes a lot of needless stress. Because men are pursuers, we have to be the ones to put ourselves out there and risk getting rejected. Women typically don’t have to. Even the women that most would consider unattractive still have a lot of attention that they don’t realize.\n\nAs a result men are the ones that risk the emotional pain that is associated with rejection. Constant direct rejection takes a toll on you emotionally. It causes a lack of confidence, low self esteem, self doubt, and just general sadness. Putting yourself out there and trying to get someone to like your personality or physical appearance is a huge risk, and men who have no real hope are better off just giving up.\n\nI also want to bring up how giving up can benefit someone. In my personal case, I started attempting to date from age 14 to the beginning of my last semester in college, at which point I was so busy I didn’t have time to try to meet women. My mind was off of dating and I was distracted. Just dropping dating from my life relieved an incredible amount of stress.\n\nI realized that I was feeling better because I had given up. I wasn’t being constantly told I’m too ugly or my personality is too repulsive to date. I wasn’t constantly changing the person I was so that I could have a good personality just to be rejected again the next week. I want spending so much money on products and clothes to look better. Thugs became simpler. \n\nI also was distracted with other things in life and I realized that I doing feel miserable or lonely without a partner if I’m always working. I was working 40 hours a week, taking classes,and working on projects and the loneliness just never had time to set in. This can be done with just about anything. Occupying your time with some form of important or non important distraction completely pushes loneliness and the sadness out.\n\nSo for all the young men in my position, I would 100% them to simply give up and find distractions to improve their lives and mental health.",

  "selftext": "Ok, hear me out, I hope this doesnt break any rules but its just my recent view, I'm not really gonna blow up earth. lol \r  \n\r  \nSo I did some reading on aggregate sentient suffering on earth (humans and animals) and all recent studies indicate that we suffer way more than not, especially people in less developed countries and wild animals suffer the most (estimated to be exponentially more than livestock). \n\n\r  \nAbout 1.4+ billion people rated above average life satisfaction, that's just 21% of the world, the rest are barely above average (est 4+ billion) and almost 2+ billion people WAY below average. This is horrible by most standards. This means most people are either unhappy or borderline. \n\n\r  \nSource: [https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#happiness-across-the-world-today](https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#happiness-across-the-world-today)\n\n\r  \nAs for the animals, we have trillions of wild animals that suffer the most, less than 20-30% (ballpark estimate) of wild animals survive till reproductive age (based on how many offspring survived) and only 10% of wild animals die from old age (another ballpark estimate). This is how nature is able to maintain its “balance”, by brutally culling all wild species through predation, diseases, parasites, starvation, natural disasters, etc and never letting any species overtake the rest, except for the anomaly known as humans. It would be ridiculous to claim that wild animals are “happy” or “satisfied” with their conditions, they simply don’t have a choice but to obey instincts and suffer. \n\n\r  \nI don’t think I need to say much about livestock, we all know what happens to them, right? They may suffer less than wild animals, but not by much, as they suffer by human hands instead, billions of them, daily. Only a tiny percentage of pets get to live the “good” life. \n\n\r  \nSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild\\_animal\\_suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering)\n\n\r  \nIn conclusion, most humans and animals simply don’t have great lives on earth and this has been the factual truth for millions of years, it doesn’t look like we could fix it either, especially with various world ending disasters on the horizon, such as climate change, pollution, mass extinction, AI abuse and eventual wars. Since we cant fix it, why do we persist? Why live just to suffer? Would it not be moral to just “euthanize” earth instead of fighting an incurable disease that will just claim countless victims forever? Tech Utopians believe we could one day solve the suffering problem for all humans and animals, but I highly doubt this, there are just too many ways to suffer and we have no real solutions for any of them, I don’t think we will ever solve this, at least not for all humans and animals, a significant percentage will always suffer, regardless of tech and time spent.  \n\n\r  \nOf course I’m not suggesting we just nuke the world or something painful that cant permanently solve the problem, but maybe a more merciful and peaceful exit through technology. I’m thinking of something like futuristic tech that could just put all humans and animals to sleep, simultaneously, instantly and painlessly, then the AI and robots will use geo engineering to make earth’s atmosphere incompatible for life, preventing primitive bacteria from evolving. \n\n\r  \nYes, it sounds like a sad ending for life on earth, but compared to endlessly suffering without a cure, wouldn’t this be much better and moral? \n\n\r  \nIf anyone has a better counter argument to change my view, please let me know, I would love to change my mind, but the depressing empirical data is simply too convincing.",

  "selftext": "First off, this is not aimed at christianity itself. If your interpretation of the bible has led you to this, then good for you. I don't want to challenge your beliefs. I'm talking exclusively about the figure of Jesus here.\n\nThat said, I don't think there's any reason to believe Jesus himself, and the people who wrote the bible, were any better at this aspect than most modern day conservatives. Maybe a *bit* better than some of them, as they maybe wouldn't have treated LGBT people as second-class citizens who ought to be eliminated, but they would still treat them as people that are in a state of sin. They might've been tolerant towards them, but tolerance is not the same as acceptance, especially the progressive way some denominations treat the subject nowadays, being open to same-sex marriage and against the idea what homossexuality is a sin and etc. They were, first and foremost, first century Jews, after all, and Jews have been historically conservative, even to this day -- so is there any reason to believe Jesus would've been any different?\n\nThe main argument I see is that the New Testament (which is, by all means, the words of Jesus and his disciples) never directly said anything about homosexuality, but I always found that argument lacking because the bible simply doesn't list every sin (as it is often stressed by any christian, even progressive ones) -- that might be because they weren't considered a sin and not because it was taken for granted, true, but then that leads to many other problems when you think about the sins that are not listed. If you really want to take that argument at face value, then that would mean that something like Matt Walsh's creepy statement that [it's normal for 16yo girls to get married and pregnant](https://www.reddit.com/r/ToiletPaperUSA/comments/xwzioh/matt_walsh_advocates_for_impregnation_of_16_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) is biblically coherent. Absurd and gross by today's standards, and I need to stress that I'm **NOT** equating the two of those, but you'd be hard pressed to refute him biblically, as marriage was in fact normal and acceptable at that age at the time Jesus lived, and I find it difficult to believe that any of the disciples or even Jesus himself would disagree with him (Mary herself would have been around that age, after all).",

  "title": "CMV: Transracial adoptees can racially identify with the country they were born in",
  "selftext": "Ok so for some context- I was adopted from China when I was a toddler. I was born in central China, abandoned at birth, and lived in an orphanage until being adopted. Now I’m in my 20’s living in Minnesota. I have no information on my medical or family history- so I have always just said I’m of Asian descent- and if I had to specify a country I say China.\n\nProbably on a monthly basis I get asked about my race. I always respond with “Chinese,” and most people are satisfied with that answer and drop the subject.\n\nHowever, I’ve met several people who don’t think I look Chinese and are dead set that I am [insert another race]. And if they know I’m adopted, they say something along the lines of you don’t really know if you’re Chinese because you don’t know your parents, so you could be anything.\n\nYes- I know they are technically right- I don’t know if I’m actually of Chinese descent- but I personally find it very invasive and inappropriate to point that out. I also don’t know why it really matters. Sure there’s a good chance I’m not 100% Chinese, but who cares? Very few people are of purely one descent. And I feel like it’s hard to truly know your racial background without a DNA test. I don’t know why me being adopted bars me from saying I’m Chinese. Also a lot of these conversations are with people I don’t know too well- so I don’t really want to have an in depth conversation regarding identity/race/adoption.\n\nI genuinely don’t understand why people have a problem with me saying I’m Chinese. I already have a lot of insecurities related to race and being adopted, and this only heightens those insecurities. \n\nIf anyone has a reason/argument for why I can’t/shouldn’t identify as Chinese I truly want to know. I really want to understand why so many people have said this to me. Thanks in advanced for all your input\n\nEdit 1- I just want to clarify- I know ethnicity/race/nationality are all different. From my experience, the average person off the street doesn’t know the nuances and differences between these ideas. Oftentimes people use nationality and ethnicity as a euphemism for race. I said this in a reply- but when people ask questions, it’s important to try and understand what the person is actually asking and wanting to know. Yes, there are people who are asking about my cultural background and if I participate in Chinese traditions, but most of the time people are asking about my background in the context of physical appearances. Also, I generally don’t mind when people are curious about my background. The two main problems I have is when it’s done in an inappropriate manner (like if it’s asked rudely or asked by a stranger at an inappropriate time), or if I say I am Chinese, then they say I can’t say I’m Chinese because I’m adopted and don’t know my biological history. When people make these comments, they’re saying I can’t say I’m of Chinese descent. At that point the conversation has nothing to do with whether or not I can identify with Chinese culture or heritage, but rather that I need to know my birth parents to truly be able to say I’m of Chinese descent biologically speaking. I also know that probably the topic that “race is a social construct” will come up. That’s a whole discussion of itself, but for all intents and purposes, I’m asking what’s wrong with saying I’m Chinese when people ask about my race in relation to my physical phenotype. I don’t see why people are so against me saying I’m Chinese in response to that question. I have had several people want to debate why I can’t say I am Chinese because I’m adopted - which is a conversation I don’t want to spend my energy on.\n\nEdit 2- Ok another clarification- transracial adoption means an adoption in which the parents and child are of different races. It has nothing to do with trying to change one’s race or intentionally presenting oneself as a different race.",

  "title": "CMV: Trump has ironically saved the GOP and we're in for a massive party realignment",
  "selftext": "**This is a controversial opinion but I'm not even a Trumper myself but his impact has more than benefited the GOP than hurt them.**\n\nI'll first explain the GOP before trump, the Trump's affects on the GOP while he was POTUS, and the GOP's possible plans and best scenarios post Trump. And use historical comparisons to back it up.\n\nOne thing hes done was securing the Supreme Court for the GOP for decades to come by putting in conservative judges.\n\nBut anyway, political realignment (in America) typically occurs every 30 to 40 years under the two-party system; the most recent realignment occurred in the 1960s during the Civil Rights movement. I contend that FDR's New Deal initiated this realignment, but the 1960s effectively ended the party swap. The Reagan period brought greater right-wing neoliberalism, which altered the economic landscape of America. The GOP is appealing to Southerners' cultural beliefs (States rights, limited government, gun rights, and Christianity) but minorities are also flocking to the Democratic party. This began in 2016, and we are now witnessing it as a result of Donald Trump, the most adored, despised, and divisive figure in America. After 2008 wars in the Middle East costed them voters especially with the election of Obama. They lost Presidential elections in 2008 and 2012 (despite winning some midterms) as they were losing appeal with the Reagan era policy. 2016 changed all of that controversially, Trump brought in and ushered a new era of the GOP that was stagnating, revolving around protectionist, nationalist and pro-worker. Some of Trump's policies like the tax cuts didn't benefit the working class but he had to cater to the old guard wing of the GOP that disliked him as for much of the rest of his term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*People also forget the reason why Trump won, its because after decades of failed promises, wage stagnation, industrial decline and corporate profits, people wanted to vote for an outsider that catered to their issues. That also worked, populist rhetoric towards the working class especially in the rust belt and other places that voted for Obama in 08 and 2012.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn politics there are a lot of talks about his two impeachments, january 6 and some conspiracy theories as to why he damaged the GOP's credibility. Along with rise of MTG and Boebert showing how radical the GOP has become. First off whenever a nation is largely divided (and in a culture war), the radical small minority on both sides are typically the loudest. We seen this during the Civil War with the radical republicans abolitionists vs the dixie aristocratic slave owners, and also in the 60s-70s with the emergence of the hippies, and Nixon's silent majority. And what the media does is record and focus on those people and tell the population that \"tHeSe PeOpLe ArE tHe DaNgEr To ThE nAtIoN, uNdErMiNiG dEmOcRaCy\" essentially being the opium of the masses.  And the MSM certainly hopes it turns away voters from the GOP. But hey some of that criticism is largely correct like January 6 being bad for democracy and the danger of Covid conspiracy theories. But thats not the point, point is that Trump saved the GOP. What Trump did was he breathed a new life into the GOP that was dying and looking for an identity.As a result, there was Compared to Romney in 2012, 2016 attracted more Hispanic, Black, and Asian voters to the GOP. In just 4 years, Trump earned the second-highest number of votes for a presidential candidate in US history, despite the scandals, media hyperbole, and catastrophic covid pandemic. Trump got more votes than Obama, who was surpassed by Biden in terms of the number of votes received by a victorious candidate. People don't realize that there are still significant portions of the populace that agree with Trump's ideals and rhetoric about putting America first. Even with the high voter participation and how controversial Trump was, one might assume he wouldn't have as many votes and it would be a blowout, yet the reverse is true. We also see trails of that with the midterms in 2022, an increase in the amount of hispanic voters to the GOP  along with Muslim voters. The culture war also has took part in this along with trans issue in schools. The Democratic party alienating parts of their coalition base voters that are typically more conservative than the progressive agenda they've been embracing and pushing.Lets take it back to Trump. His rhetoric wasn't Presidential and damaged some credibility people had to the system, but people catered to that and felt he was anti-establishment crusader. All the media is doing is fueling this by always presenting him on the news and criticizing him. What they're making him appear is for Trump to look like a common man figure thats hated by every other establishment elitist.\n\nTrump's affects has made demographically the GOP more diverse, multiethnic and more working class like I already mentioned. They're losing college educated suburban voters who tend to be more  wealthy and left leaning, and reject the Trump affect. The Democratic becoming more aligned with the coastal big city and suburban elite. So to say that the GOP will become racist white nationlist party is stupidly idiotic and overblown, and we've seen this in the past take place. After the civil rights era the Republican party despite losing northern voters and utilizing the southern strategy, they didn't become the party supporting segregation as this will be political suicide and lose voters. They catered to the South through conservative cultural values which remained to day which are more small govt, pro-gun, and christian religious values. Barry Goldwater and Reagan followed up on solidifying this. So it wouldn't make sense to say the GOP today is going to be a white nationalist racist party today when they didn't after the civil rights era. Clearly then being pro segregation after the civil rights era is going to cause you lose elections especially when you had wings in your party that supported the civil rights movement. Therefore I don't see this happening with the GOP today flirting with white supremacy, in a more diverse and racially counscious society.Party's beliefs are always shaped their voters demographics, and they change when their is a major demographic change of voters. There voter base has shifted from very white to increasingly multi-ethnic. This strategic change is very different from a decade ago when the party was supported more by big business corporations and suburban voters. As for The Democrats they've been catering more to the affluent or educated white liberal on social issues in which wokeness and polarization being their platform. That has largely alienated many of their coalition, white working class, hispanics, blacks and muslims voters who are more traditionally conservative. One could think Trump's anti muslim rhetoric and anti-immigrant ideology would backstab the GOP but it hasn't. GOP has largely been more culturally connected to these groups which is also the main reason why the wings of the party (RINOS, evangelicals, neolibs, Trumpers, small govt) have still been united despite dislike and opposition to the Trumpers of the party.Also lets focus on recent political events that political analysts think will hurt the GOP. Remember when everyone were saying that the Republicans were trying to restrict voting and become more increasingly authoritarian and anti democratic? There was an outcry from everyone, from the MSM, to corporations, to even the MLB. People were saying that this will further radicalize & alienate the GOP within itself, but this hasn't even took place. They were thinking that this will be a huge issue in the 2022 midterms but instead they took over the House, and also have mostly maintained governorship in the midterms. And no losses in key states that passed these voting laws. And with  flipping a governor seat in Nevada, a state that voted for Biden in 2020. I don't see anybody talk about voting rights as a major issue for the upcoming elections, not even the mainstream media themselves.\n\nThe new issue that took up that culture war instead has been abortion after Roe vs. Wade was overturned. Media analysts are saying that Abortion will become a big issue in the 2024 election but that's overblown. I don't even think this will be a large talking point after the election as the average American's main issue has been the economy and inflation. Abortion is going to continue to be talked about but then fade away and end up more of an issue between the states unless the GOP passes somewhat a federal ban on abortion which would cause massive backlash.\n\nWhat I expect to take place for the Republican Party post-Trump is, as the old wing of the the dies out and leaves, the Trump wing remains and it becomes the majority symbol of the party. With Trump's ideas and policies being the platform. (Protectionist trade, anti-illegal immigration, stronger borders, anti-China, anti-big tech and wokeness).  Right after the disappointing result in the midterms members of the GOP have called on the GOP's elites to change and appeal demographically along with taking the populist rhetoric that Trump given them.  The gop memo: [https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20534328-banks-working-class-memo)\n\nAs history shows , party's align and always appeal to their demographic voting base, they also adapt to the changes of the population.\n\nTo conclude this 2016 changed American politics just as it did right after the War of 1812 (emergence of the Whig Party and end of the federalist), right after the Civil War and reconstruction (Radical Republicans taking hold of the party), right after the Great Depression (Increase in black voters for the democrats), and right after the Civil Rights era (GOP becoming southern centric, Democrats becoming the party for minorities). Demographic change occurs first before political economic change, which is what we're witnessing, a great party realignment. *2024 is going to be the next step in that party realignment. And I certainly think Trump played a big role in this change and mostly to the GOP's benefit.*\n\nI'm curious on any refutations and disagreements. And hope for a good discussion",

  "selftext": "This post is essentially about semantics, but I think it's important.\n\n\"The Patriarchy\" is a often problematic term because of its ambiguousness and vagueness: there are many ways to interpret the term beyond \"male lead\". My concern is that some interpretations of the concept are more reasonable than others.\n\nIf by Patriarchy you simply are referring to the existence of patriarchal culture or structures, then this is just a matter of truth or falseness of facts.\n\nHowever, if \"The Patriarchy\" is interpreted to mean something like \"the society we live in is universally oppressive to women, and men at all levels of society are mostly complicit in this because they benefit from it\" then I begin to become concerned.\n\nSaudi Arabia could maybe be described as a Patriarchy. Pre 1960's America was a Patriarchy. Those societys were really designed around men and what benefited them, and women were just tools and a subject to the design by men perpetuated by legislation and norms.\n\nBut modern America doesn't function like this. Feminism has already \"cracked\" and fragmented Patriarchy. I'm not saying sexism is gone, just that our culture is a complex mix of sexism and non sexist elements. The patriarchal cultures that exist are only partial aspects of our society that we need to fight against, it isn't THE WHOLE of society.\n\nWhen we treat America like it still is a universal, unilateral Patriarchy, then we run the risk of radicalized and unreasonable ideological perspectives. You get the stereotypical feminists who want to blame every problem on men, gender, and might have a victim hood complex. Or it will ferment a deep resentment of men in the mind of the feminist identifying person because their mind has chosen to define their entire world around the actions of shitty men.",

I've never been able to attract the attention or interest of others and most don't interest me. Those that I do have interest in, especially romantically, I rationalize as just a surface level physical attraction and that I don't really know them as a person. To get to know them I'd have to go up to them, be it in a restaurant, bookstore, parking lot, mall or bar and that would require communication.\n\nNow I'm not a very attractive fellow. Ethnic, starting to bald, horrible teeth from years of bad dental care. I'm not very confident or good at speaking either, I stutter and mumble alot in a way that could best be described as talking to a child (I'm 30). Since any interaction I could have with another human being would be a net negative for them, it would count as harassment. I'm not seeking to denigrate or harass other human beings, interfere with their space or make them uncomfortable. By leaving people alone and sparing them from harassment (of me potentially talking to them), I am doing the morally correct and ethical thing. Thus me being alone and an Incel is morally correct.\n\nI live with my parents still. My income is abysmal. I get paid to write erotic fiction, and a lot of what I write or fetishize is (admittedly) misogynistic. I don't consider myself misogynistic, only my sexuality is and there's an inherent difference. Thus in another way I'm saving any woman or potential partner from the misogyny of my own fetishes or pornographic interests. Alot of them are also pretty weird and would make any relationship an instant no.\n\nI'm not really in tune with popular culture or most things people care about - sports, celebrities, pop music, politics. I do have political views (I'm a socialist) but I'm not going to try to debate someone about it or anything. Since there's a 40% odd statistically the person supports trump, that's a 4/10 chance I'll be disgusted or they will first and they disagree and leave. The chances that someone is not disgusted by my political views, fetishes, appearance, lack of money or success in life is slim, so inceldom is more a consequence of my state of being than a conscious choice. There might be some people interested in my writings or ideas but since they would likely also be highly autistic or completely outside the norm, there's not really a chance it could ever be shared or discussed in public without further ostracization. Am I happy? Not usually, but trying to force me to become some 'good boy' for twitterpoints or what the media thinks a person should be is oppressive, conformist and destructive.\n\nIt's ok that I'm an Incel.

Why is losing your job inherently a problem?\n\nIf we had a universal basic income for people especially those who lost their jobs that would be great. And I'm sure if AI really is going to take a lot of our jobs there will be something like a UBI coming into place. If AI took our jobs we would have more money and efficiency and less need to work, I don't get why unemployment would be a bad thing. This is if we assume AI work will grow the economy but I'm sure it will considering higher efficiency rate.\n\nNobody having to work and AI automating our needs efficiently... isn't reaching ultimate efficiency to stop people needing to work almost the goal of civilisation?\n\nEdit: I am not American my country is way more left-wing... so that probably explains a lot of the difference in perception haha",

  "selftext": "1) the man's last name is cooler (ETA: more appealing due to how it sounds, length, history, etc)\n\n2) the woman has trauma associated with her family name\n\n3) both people change their name to something new or combine names\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a younger millennial and female whose friends are all getting married, I have been putting considerable thought into this issue. In 2023, it does not make sense to me why so many of them are changing their names to their husband's, or it is assumed that they will. To me, it is an incredibly patriarchal practice rooted in reducing women to property and chipping away at their identity; plus, this practice serves as an additional pink tax (name changes are expensive and time consuming!). Most women I know who have gotten married, imo, took on a significantly worse name just because society expected them to. Also, a common reason I've heard that women change their name is so they can share a last name with their children. Why is it default that children have their father's last name (who oftentimes leaves, is abusive or absent)? Reddit, change my view (or validate it)!\n\nETA: “because they want to” is a reasonable fourth option. However, I wonder to what extent many women actually want to or just do because society says they should or it’s the easiest course of action. \n\nETA: I totally get that couples want to share a last name. My issue with it is that in most heterosexual partnerships, the assumption is that the woman changes her name. The reverse option is seldom given consideration. \n\nETA: I am NOT trying to argue a woman shouldn’t have the right to choose or change her name. But that doesn’t mean I can’t question the reason WHY a woman usually does change her name.",

It's much less active than other parts of the chicken, which results in a lot less flavor. Paradoxically, it's also less tender and drier because it has less fat . Even if you cook it meticulously it will never be as soft or juicy as a chicken thigh or drumstick. It's literally the worst of both worlds.\n\nThe SOLE redeeming quality, in my opinion, is its consistent shape and large size which makes it suitable for stuffed or cutlet style dishes that are breaded and fried. Chicken parm and chicken kiev are quite tasty, the breading keeps it fairly juicy.

  "title": "CMV: The US should create a modern version of the \"Flying Tigers\" squadron in Ukraine similar to the original one in China which fought the Japanese",
  "selftext": "In 1940, seeing a need for a bolstered Chinese air force, Chang Kai Shiek, and his American advisor Claire Lee Chennault came up with a plan to recruit American military pilots to join the Chinese air force to bolster China's defense, even before Pearl Harbor was attacked.  Chennault lobbied congress and eventually got his plan approved.  The plan would be for around 100 American pilots to leave the US military, travel to China and fly US supplied planes with Chinese markings, but under command of the Chinese military, and officially employed as mercenaries by an aircraft manufacturing company.  The key thing to note though is they were officially not affiliated with the US military, they were mercenaries and members of the Chinese air force.  This group became known as the \"Flying tigers.\"  In the end, they are credited with destroying over 220 Japanese aircraft, and 14 pilots were killed in action.  \n\nI believe this model could be applied to Ukraine as a way to bolster the Ukrainian air force.  \n\nThe Ukraine war has clearly entered into a stalemate, with neither side making any meaningful progress.  The only way this will be broken is some drastic change in technology or firepower, and the obvious place this will come is by the air.  Ukraine has largely blunted the Russian air force due to its Western supplied air defense system despite having only a few planes itself.  You can check out many videos from the beginning of the war of Ukrainian soldiers with stinger missiles shooting down Russian helicopters.  Russian pilots soon realized Ukraine is too dangerous to fly missions over, and have resorted to lobbing random rockets and missiles well behind the front lines, with Ukraine doing the same with its very limited Soviet fleet.  \n\nThe \"West\" has committed to training Ukrainian pilots on more modern jets, such as F16s, however, there is an extensive training curve, which is why no jets have been delivered yet.  Pilots have to learn English to be able to fly the planes, as well as the controls, which are often different from Soviet aircraft.  Ukraine also has a very limited number of pilots, with some already being killed in action during the war.  \n\nThe way the Flying Tigers was set up maintained the degree of separation which kept the US out of the war prior to Pearl Harbor.  Given the number of former US military personal who have gone to Ukraine to fight, it's not inconceivable to think you could not organize a small group of American or \"Western\" fighter pilots,  who might be interested, like the group who went to China in 1940-1942.  If any of the pilots are active duty, they would be discharged from the US air force or their respective military and enlist in the Ukrainian air force.  The US and other countries would then supply modern fighter aircraft, painted with Ukrainian markings, that they are trained to fly.  The US would supply weapons and maintenance to these planes, but the pilots would be taking orders from the Ukrainians and being paid by them, not the US or any other country.  \n\nBesides supporting Ukraine, it would be valuable to see how American fighter planes perform in a real world combat situation.  A jet such as the F35 or F22completely outclasses anything Russia can deploy in Ukraine, and could be useful for attacking targets far behind Russian lines given their stealth technology, such as in Crimea, a vulnerability which which F16s and F18s would still suffer from.  \n\n I know what everyone is going to say... \"ESCALATION.\"  This would be the US entering the war and directly fighting. Russia, this might lead to nuclear war.  Yeah, I understand the reservation.  My counter to that is many ex soldiers, including veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan have gone to Ukraine to fight, while not officially being sanctioned by the US, they have provided training and bolstered the ranks of the Ukrainian army.  Some of these soldiers have even been killed in action, or captured by Russia and later exchanged in prisoner swaps.  While Russia labels them as \"mercenaries,\" it still has not lead to any direct escalation between NATO countries and Russia.  This even includes Trevor Reid, a Marine corps veteran who was arrested in Russia after a drunk night out on suspicious circumstances, and later freed in a prisoner swap.   After being exchanged, he enlisted in the Ukrainian army, obviously wanting to settle his score with Russia, later injured and airlifted to Germany.  \n\nMany of these foreign volunteers are also using Western weapons while fighting Russia, or training Ukrainians on how to properly use them.  Again, arming Ukraine has caused absolutely 0 escalation with Russia.  These volunteers again, are not members of any Western military, but members of the Ukrainian army.  I don't see why fighter pilots would be the exception.  They would be Americans, flying American supplied aircraft under command of the Ukrainian air force, no difference than an American tank driver or machine gunner in Eastern Ukraine.  \n\nRussia also heavily employs mercenaries in its war against Ukraine.  Wagner is the most famous one, maintaining a massive security empire for corrupt African countries and sneaking their resources back to Russia as a way to evade sanctions.  Wagner was also used to capture Syrian oil fields from rebel fighters, and negotiate contracts for large percentages of their revenue in exchange for protection.  Russia still denied the existence of such groups, referring to them simply as \"volunteers.\"  US backed forces in Syria were even attacked by them in 2018, and the US military fought back, with 0 Russian military reaction.  My point is there's already significant precedent for mercenary activities with Russia.  We would simply be using their own playbook against them, and when Russia complains or threatens over the pilots, we just shrug and say they're volunteers, they can do what they want, and they probably got the planes the same way Russian \"volunteers\" got their BUK missile system that shot down MH17 in 2014.  Russia has already consented to mercenary combatants by using Wagner in the Ukraine war, and sneaking in GRU agents to fight Ukraine in 2014, how is it any different if we do the same thing? Even during the Cold War there is anecdotal evidence of the Soviets sending fighter pilots to sneak into the North Korean and North Vietnamese air force during the Korean and Vietnam wars.  That never started WWIII.  \n\nI do concede that such a program is a pipe dream given a new Ukraine aid funding bill can't even get passed in congress, but I do believe if implemented, it would be significant in Ukraine's defense, without leading to a wider conflict.  So please, change my view.  \n\n&#x200B;",

  "title": "CMV: Liberalism is more of a moderate right wing ideology, or centrist ideology than a left wing ideology",
  "selftext": "Liberalism as a political philosophy is more or less a combination of conservative and socialist ideas and acts like a middle ground between the left wing socialists and the right wing conservatives. \n\nLiberals like conservatives believe in private ownership of corporations, private ownership of the means of production, and private ownership of land. \n\nLiberals like conservatives believe in not just market based, but market driven economies\n\nIn Europe and Australia liberals are synonymous with free market conservatives/libertarians \n\n>Over time, the meaning of liberalism began to diverge in different parts of the world. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica: \"In the United States, liberalism is associated with the welfare-state policies of the New Deal programme of the Democratic administration of Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt, whereas in Europe it is more commonly associated with a commitment to limited government and laissez-faire economic policies.\"[29] Consequently, the ideas of individualism and laissez-faire economics previously associated with classical liberalism are key components of modern American conservatism\n\nSo conservatism and liberalism would have a lot of overlap. This is especially representative with neoliberalism. \n\nNeoliberalism would have a huge wave in the 1980's brought on by American republican Ronald Reagan, British conservative Margaret Thatcher, and other conservative parties throughout the world including the Canadian conservative party, the Australian liberal party, and more. But it is important to note they are all right wing parties. \n\nDon't get me wrong, liberalism has some things it shares with socialism \n\nLiberalism and socialism both believe in a secular state and freedom of religion\n\nBoth liberalism and socialism share a focus on human and civil rights \n\nHowever I'm reluctant to call liberalism a left wing ideology because it lacks many things other left wing ideologies have in common like social ownership. There's multiple different types of social ownership, but liberalism doesn't offer any of them. \n\nUnion strengthening, union support are hallmarks of socialism, yet liberal parties give unions the bare minimum. The countries with strong unions have them because of democratic socialist parties that strengthened them. \n\nThere's no redistribution of wealth under liberalism. \n\nUnder liberalism, public infrastructure and public health still gets minimal spending, and private companies are still invited in all the time to increase costs by asking for profit on top of cost of materials and labour, which either means the government pays more or the labourers get paid less, but usually it's a bit of both. This happens in public healthcare and public infrastructure construction. \n\n(When I say socialism, I don't mean communist, or anarchist and when I say conservative I don't mean fascist, monarchists, or anarcho-capatilists.)\n\nAnd socialism, liberalism, and conservatism also all share ideologies as well.  they all believe in a state governed by a citizen elected body. They all believe in the rule of law. They all believe \n\nBut overall I would have to say Liberalism is not a very left wing ideology at all, and amounts to something near moderate centrism.\n\nEdit: most modern political parties sort themselves into international organizations. International democrat union (union if conservative parties) liberals international, progressive alliance, socialist international, and global greens. \n\nIn the west, most democratic socialists parties separated from socialists international in 2013 to become the progressive alliance. \n\nThe IDU places themselves firmly on the right. Progressive alliance and global greens are firmly on the left. And then there's liberals who seems to have overlap with both conservatives and progressives. They agree with conservatives on many economic principles, but agree with progressives on human and civil rights. \n\nMany of the leaders in liberals international describe themselves as believers in the third way. \n\nThird way - is a centrist political position that attempts to reconcile centre-right and centre-left politics by synthesising a combination of economically liberal and social democratic economic policies along with centre-left social policies.\n\nSo by definition most liberal parties and leaders are striving for centrism.

  "title": "cmv: We as humans have no autonomy over our own lives.",
  "selftext": "Here's a thought that has been cropping up over and over in my brain lately, I'm interested in seeing what others have to say about it. Here's how it goes:\n\nWhile we may think that we are able to freely make decisions, and determine the course of our lives, in truth we have no control over that.  \nThat is because, every decision we make, no matter how conscious, can ultimately be led back to factors which we had no control over.\n\nHere some examples to illustrate:  \nWe may choose to follow our passion in our lives, for example to become a singer because we love music, and to us it may seem like thereby we choose to do the thing we love. But actually, why would we love music so much that we want to make it our carreer? Ask anyone why they are passionate about the thing they are passionate about, and I don't thing anyone will tell you that they just decided to do so. We may be passionate about music because we had an experience in our childhood that inspired us to go down that path, it may be because we connect it to certain memories, and because we are genetically inclined to have a knack for it.  \nOr, if an addict chooses to get help and try to beat it. Why do they decide to that? Either because it is hurtung them in some form, or because it is hurting someone else, not because they want to change for the pure sake of itself. And if someone decides not to do something about their addiction, even if it hurts them or someone else, that is because they did not have experiences in their past, that make them care enough about such things. Care for oneself and or others needs to either be ingrained from birthed, or be teached at some point. If neither of those things happened, and therefore it is not in their capacity to fight to beat addiction, that is not because they are fault, but because they just did not happen to have such experiences. And if someone does have the capacity to fight addiction, that is not because they actively decided to have that, but because they happened to have had experiences which made them develope it. Anyone would stop themselves or others from hurting, if they had the mental capacity to do so, some people just don't.  \nAnd even if it is not about helping yourself but accepting help from others, the same logic applies. To accept that help, they would need some reason that ultimately is out of their own control, if not, no one would bother.\n\nObviously you could come up with any kind of internal reason like \"They want to have a better life\" or whatever, but even then, the question can be asked, why they want a better life. Because they have seen the success of others and want to replicate it? Sure. But what makes them want to replicate that success? Or maybe they want a better life because they aren't happy with their current one, in which case you can do the same thing, and ask why they aren't happy with that. And you can keep asking such questions, until you inevitablyend up at some circumstance that was outside of that person's control, and that methodoly can be applied to any action we take, which makes me conclude that in reality we do not have control over our lives, but are purely made to make the decisions we make by outside factors.\n\nSo far at least. I hope I have explained my point well so everyone understands it, but if clarification is needed I will of course give it. And of course I would be happy to hear any thoughts which might refute my hypothesis.\n\nAnd just to clarify, the question whether the hypothetical fact, that all we do is decided by outside factors, is good or bad, is not part of that same hypothesis. While I do have my own feelings about it, someone might just as well not care if it is true, and enjoy their life nonetheless, and that is completely valid to me.",

  "selftext": "Most people think of labor markets as determined by supply and demand. This is actually not a great model of the labor market in general, but for the purposes of this post, it’ll do. Basically, most people think of immigration as an increase in labor supply. Labor supply is the number of people willing to work at a given wage. So, more people, more workers for any given wage. As a result of the labor supply increase, wages go down.  \nOK, but working isn’t the only thing that immigrants do. They also buy stuff. They rent apartments. They buy food. They get haircuts. They go to the doctor.  \nAll that stuff takes labor to produce. Food takes labor. Haircuts take labor. Doctor visits take labor. Building new apartments takes labor. And so on. Even if the immigrants don’t start spending their money on day 1, businesses can see the immigration wave coming and they know there will be increased demand for their products. So they hire more people. To hire more people they have to…raise wages.\n\nA positive labor supply shock pushes wages down. A positive labor demand shock pushes up wages. Maybe one of those effects is a little bigger; maybe the other. But they’re going to mostly cancel out.\r  \n\r  \nAnd to see why this is true, just think about babies. Each new generation is bigger than the one that came before it. If those young people were just a labor supply increase, then as population went up, wages would go down.

  "selftext": "\r  \nl I'm saying this as someone who supports the legalization of prostitution but personally would not want to partake in it for personal reasons \n\n\r  \nSo as a result of the feminist movement and the newfound financial freedom of women no longer have to settle for shitty men and that of course is a good thing. This has lead to a growth in the amount of men who can't find partners as most women are either pursuing higher quality men or are willing to just remain single if they can't find a high quality man. This of course is leading to less sexual activity than ever (for men) and is yielding some pretty scary things from the men who feel they've been wronged. A clear solution to this, and just to men feeling the need for sex but can't get it in general would be prostitution, which could be done safely and in a much more ethical way if it were done with government oversight rather than the oversight of pimps.\r  \n\r  \nSome feminist support this as a way to keep sex workers safe, a lot don't. I feel that part of the reason that a lot of swerfs oppose sex work is to in some way punish men who they wouldn't sleep with. The messaging used to oppose men who do think prostitution should be legal is that \"men aren't entitled to women's bodies and allowing men to buy sex would go against that.\" So that to me does two things, first it removes autonomy from women. So sure, yes the autonomy to do what they want with their body, but moreso the idea that if it is possible for a man to buy sex from a woman that makes him entitled to her is wrong. Firstly, a woman being a prostitute doesn't mean she has to have sex with any man that asks. She'd still be allowed to refuse or withdraw consent. Saying this implies otherwise and that women who choose to do sex work don't have the ability to consent.\r  \n\r  \nI also think it unfairly makes sex work a man-woman issue where men can only support sex work so they can bang women. More people other than just men support legalization and regulation, more people other than women do sex work. More people other than men purchase sex work. The way swerfs look at the issue is incredibly reductive. That's why I think it's less about supporting women and more about in some way punishing men. Currently attractive men have a monopoly on sex, again which isn't a bad thing as it means women have the freedom to pursue men who they actually find attractive. That has lead to the number of sexually active men dropping significantly compared to the number of active women.\r  \n\r  \nAs a result if less than attractive men want to have sex, they would be the ones fueling prostitution. I think completely depriving these men of sex is a way to get some type of revenge for the years of oppression women have faced. Of course they wouldn't want attractive men to be without sex, because they want to have sex with attractive men. So the men they don't want to bang are a safe target to do this to.",

Second point, most marital problems are due finanical followed by adultery. One problem I have as a religious person is how can one be told to go and multiply many while also being told to go into union. I do believe more partners would likely increase chances of multiplying. Third, everyone has desires so why lie about them? Just be honest from the beginning that at some point in time the other partner or you maybe tempted and instead of acting upon it should share that desire. The damage is always due to irresponsibly high expectations in another which leads to disappointment, heartbreak, and blame placing. The only true problem isn't the action itself as it is the expectation. If people accepted we are not made to be monogamous then maybe more marriages would last and it could be seen as a fun activity such as choosing a restaurant.

If they knew women personally they’ll realise they aren’t so different  to men,  they’re just PEOPLE, as far as I’m concerned women’s want, needs worries and pursuits are fundamentally the same to that of a man in terms of finding a partner and life in general. Actually having a conversation with one, beyond just trying to sleep with them will yield such a conclusion.\n\nIt’s always hilarious when they talk about, when and if I find a girlfriend, admitting they have no experience with the opposite sex at all. It’s genuinely pathetic seeing so many lonely, repressed young men dogpile onto the anti woman circlejerk these so called alpha males and pick mes have created. \n\nThey put they’re own insecurities and personal failings at the feet of women, jerking each other off as stoic and sigma and whatever other Greek letter they decide to bastardise this week. Instead of realising that they’re just unpleasant, repugnant people, who normal people don’t want to associate with because they are so disconnected from reality. Because off the internet they have nothing interesting to say or do to actually get women to talk to them or be interested in them, they think they’re muscles will magically attract every female in the vicinity like a lynx advert. Instead of trying to develop an actual interesting personality or develop basic social skills it’s all the women’s fault for not finding them attractive. \n\nThe rest of their viewers are just jaded losers, who got rejected or maybe had one toxic relationship and have now decided to write off half of humanity based on one experience. Until the people who watch this rubbish actually grow up or get to know women on a genuine level, I foresee a bleak, lonely and miserable future for these lost chaps.",

  "title": "CMV: it's hypocrtical to talk about how unhealthy veganism is",
  "selftext": "I am not a nutritionist so my point of view may be wrong. Also, I am not a vegan either lol\n\na common rebuttal you see against veganism is \"I'm going to go eat a burger\" or \"I'm going to go eat some bacon lol\" Proponents of anti-veganism will often talk about the health problems with the diet.\n\nBut, if you compare this to the SAD (Standard American Diet) or western diet that most people in the US are on before becoming vegan, you'll see that the problems pale in comparison to what was happening beforehand. And, this diet is starting to plague other countries as well. Only 12% percent of Americans eat the recommended amount of fruit, and 9% eating the recommended amount of vegetables. (probably myself included) The SAD diet is full of foods like Fried foods, Grain-based desserts, High-fat dairy Processed foods, Processed meats (e.g., bacon and deli meats), Red meat, Refined grains (e.g., white pasta, white flour, etc.), and Sugar-sweetened beverages. It critically lacks vital things like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low fat dairy. While in a vegan diet, you may lack things like protein, B-12, and omega fatty acids (these are often supplemented though) the SAD diet is also lacking, missing important nutrients like Calcium, vitamin D, fiber, and potassium. The SAD diet contributes to many health problems like some types of cancer, Cardiovascular disease, constipation, type 2 diabetes, ect. \n\nNot every vegan diet is healthy of course. You could be vegan and eat a diet full of ramen, candy, and other junk. But, it in order to feel full, I imagine you'd have to stick closer to what is recommended. It is recommended to eat 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 cups of fruit and 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups of vegetables a day. I think it would be much easier to achieve this goal if your diet is plant based. Overall, I find it hypocritical to complain about the health effects of veganism if you are eating this diet. If you are eating a diet full of healthy animal products, plants, then I don't see the issue really, but that's not what i see lol. Even if we aren't vegan, we should all work to include more plant based meals into our diet. ",

  "title": "CMV: Reddit avatar/profile pictures should have more options for women's clothing and feminine presentation for free.",
  "selftext": "So, I was creating a burner account the other day and I randomly rolled an avatar that had a cool head, hat, and shirt. As a typical \"who cares\" type of man I don't normally care about such, but even I couldn't stand the stupid pants the guy was wearing. So, then I started to scroll through the possibilities of reddit avatars and was shocked to find that there were almost no dresses, skirts, gowns, or traditionally feminine style of dress that weren't ALSO the cutesy animal types. Sure, one could argue that in today's time women can (and should) wear what suits their fancy even if such is the traditional \"masculine\" attire. However, the other side to that coin is that options for more traditionally feminine styles are also more than valid for women to pick (AND for men as well!!!). \n\n\nIsn't half the point of reddit and the avatars to be a platform for self-expression. Isn't the avatar supposed to, in part, be a visual expression of one's personality. If most of the types of clothes that the little reddit person wears correspond to different types of dress in reality and also in fantasy shouldn't that include a significant amount of feminine attire? \n\nAdditionally, as I think entirely uncontroversial, women's fashion is significantly more diverse than men's. My head starts to spin when women reference all the different types of shirts, shorts, dresses, etc. And, yet, for the reddit avatar we don't see that happening. Where's my ankle length skirt and apron? Where's my tube top (or crop top, I don't know) with bell-bottoms (or flared legs as someone told me is now the term of art). Why don't we have gosh-darn leggingss? Maybe I'm blind.\n\nWhy can't we style a little reddit man (because it does present as masculine) with boobs? Why don't we have a more feminine version with wider hips and a thinner waist? Almost every major video game with a create a character function has that. Why doesn't reddit.\n\nLastly, and to my extreme chagrin, when looking back over the options I was shocked to find that a great, great deal of the more feminine outfits are locked behind a paywall... so now you mean to tell me that in order to have a character that looks like you or expresses your feminine style you have to pay for it? What is this????\n\n---\n\nI would like to give some arguments that I don't find particularly persuasive in the way that I understand them currently in order that conversation can progress into the substance of our potential disagreement without forcing me to roll out objections and replies that I've already thought of. Could I be persuaded by modified versions of these? Sure, possibly... but I think it will be more helpful for me to \"get out ahead\" of them just a touch.\n\n1) It's gonna cost and be more expensive to create the art for it.\n\nReply: really? Multi-million dollar company can't hire someone from deviant art or compensate a redditor from a contest (hell, people would give away their characters for free in contest form I'm sure) to use their art for a few more outfits for the avatar? Doesn't seem right here.\n\n2) Reddit man doesn't have a sex nor a gender. Therefore, all clothes are neither masculine nor feminine. \n\nReply: I think this is simply untrue. Do you mean to tell me that we don't associate certain hairstyles with women and men? Do you mean to say that the very dresses that are on offer aren't feminine. Do you mean to argue that the one floral dress bottom isn't feminine? Do you want to argue that slacks and a suit that you can do doesn't look masculine... I think not.\n\n3) Women care more about the style and avatar. Reddit is a business and wants to make money to run the site. Recent financials ain't the best (or at least could be improved). If women care more than men and would be persuaded to buy dresses, reddit should lock them out behind a pay-wall.\n\nreply: [tries not to swear]... What? Really. That just seems quite unfair and it essentially presents an unfair tax on a large group of people simply based upon wanting to have an avatar that represents them. Even if the argument is true, we shouldn't agree with it for moral reasons and due to the gut-check \"ick\" feeling associated with such scummy practices.\n\n---\nAll in all, I'm excited to see what arguments ya'll come up with for this. I think my view is pretty strong and will be victorious over scrutiny and counter. However, I'm more than willing to change my mind on this because I have a sinking feeling that I'm missing something or that I'm blind, or that I'm just wrong for unforseen reasons. It's just something that has bothered me since last night, and I just can't get it out of my head... even as a dude who doesn't care about this sort of thing a great deal, I just had an \"urrrg\" off feeling upon my realization.",

  "selftext": "First off, I'd prefer that this not turn into a broader discussion of whether the death penalty itself is wrong. That's a separate topic.\n\nThe Constitution has a ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. But death-penalty advocates have taken this to such an extreme that they consider even the slightest discomfort or pain to be \"cruel and unusual.\" If the lethal-injection chemicals cause discomfort in the vein, that's \"cruel and unusual.\" If they cause chest discomfort or other discomfort, that's \"cruel and unusual.\" When Alabama was using nitrogen to execute an inmate (which is literally one of the most humane methods possible,) they claimed it was cruel and unusual. etc.\n\nMy view of the Constitution is that \"cruel and unusual\" means some form of punishment that goes *exceptionally, intentionally, beyond the norm*. So, for instance, if the state of Texas were to sentence a criminal to die by being fed alive into a wood chipper or roasted over a barbecue, that would be cruel and unusual. That would clearly be done for no purpose other than sadism. But normal methods of execution - such as lethal injection - fall perfectly well within \"acceptable parameters\" of an execution. There may be some discomfort involved (after all, this is a procedure meant to *kill* you) but as long as it's within *normal* parameters, it is permissible.\n\nBear in mind that at the time that the Founders wrote the Constitution, executions by methods such as hanging were perfectly acceptable - so it's clear they didn't intend the death penalty to fall under the \"cruel and unusual\" category if it were performed reasonably humanely. A moderate amount of pain and discomfort does **not** count as \"cruel and unusual.\"\n\nBut death penalty opponents have taken their stance to such an extreme that any form of execution that isn't floating away to Heaven on blissful clouds of serene peace and tranquility, without the slightest pain, is considered to be \"cruel and unusual.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - CMV: No matter how pain-free an execution method may be, death-penalty opponents will move the goalposts to claim that it's still too painful or uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "EDIT: Ok… I have *not* changed my mind. But, I accept that especially for the younger gens, the term “body count” does not necessarily have a negative connotation. I still think it’s insensitive and inappropriate to refer to past sex partners as “bodies,” but I can let go of the idea that it implies violence.\n\nIf it *helps* people have conversations by diffusing tension and eliciting frank discussion, then ok. It doesn’t have to be a bad euphemism. Just because I see it that way, doesn’t mean that’s how everyone interprets it.\n\nI *hope* the net effect of the terminology is positive. I have doubts that it is. That’s where I’m gonna land on the topic.\n\nThank you to everyone who engaged. I really just meant for this to be a discussion about the societal shifts in our values towards sex as a whole. This isn’t a personal issue for me, as some people suggested it is. Aka - I’m allowed to have an opinion about something that doesn’t directly affect me.\n\nEDIT 2: In case it’s helpful to note, I’m not ashamed of my sexual history and have no problem disclosing. I don’t care if someone asks me how many people I’ve had sex with. I lost count a long time ago, but it’s somewhere around 30 men and 15 women? Ballpark figures. If you include people with whom I’ve only had oral sex with, the number goes up quite a bit.\n\nI’ve had partners with more sex partners in their past than me, and I’ve had partners who have been with less people than me. I also have partners who I have no idea how many people they’ve been with.\n\n————————————\n\nTLDR: There’s no place in a discussion about sex for a term that refers to the number of persons killed. Talking about sexual history is hard enough - why do we have to frame it in such a violent and negative way? It’s the exact opposite of a sex-positive message, and I think we’re capable of so much better.\n\n————————————\n\nI guess the term “body count” gained a lot of traction on TikTok back in 2020. I’m an old 37F, so I don’t keep up with stuff like that. But I’m seeing it talked about *A LOT* on this sub and it really just seems so awful.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia: \n\n“A body count is the total number of people killed in a particular event. In combat, a body count is often based on the number of confirmed kills, but occasionally only an estimate. Often used in reference to military combat, the term can also refer to any situation involving multiple killings, such as the actions of death squads or serial killers.”\n\nWhy *on Earth* would anyone want to refer to their past sexual partners this way?? This is a rhetorical question - I’m afraid of any actual responses.\n\nWords DO matter. If we think of someone’s past sexual history as a “body count,” we’re subconsciously setting the tone to view their history as a bad and harmful thing. I don’t care what your opinion is on someone’s “numbers,” this doesn’t help *anyone.*\n\nI love how open-minded and progressive GenZ is. For the love of all things holy, *why* did “body count” have to catch on so hard and fast? 😩 Can’t we do better than this?",

But we have to face these questions: Why are we banning prostitution? Is sex one of the basic human rights? Is banning prostitution the right thing to do?\n\nFirst of all, I can guess that some people (especially women) will say: if sex industry is legal, human trafficking will be a serious problem. I disagree with this view. For example, as long as a country allows people to use cars, there must be traffic accidents in this country, right? So, should we ban cars? The answer is of course no. So, if you think the problem of \"human trafficking\" is going to get serious, then you just need to step up efforts to crack down on traffickers, not ban prostitution.\n\nThen, some people will say: prostitution insults women.

It's as if you go to work in a company and the boss pays you, it's the same.\n\nSo, I can't think of any reason to ban prostitution at all.\n\nMore importantly, having sex is one of the basic rights of human beings, and banning prostitution is a blatant violation of human rights. Can you imagine? A 20-year-old guy lives in pain every day because he can't have sex with girls (for various reasons, like he's too shy to approach girls). Do you think all this suffering he suffered was necessary? If he had been born in a truly free country (like Holland) where prostitution was possible, he wouldn't have suffered these things. I want to say that his country has violated his human rights, and such a country should be sanctioned by the United Nations.

  "title": "CMV: No piece of music is objectively better or worse than any other music",
  "selftext": "My position is that no piece of music is “objectively better” or “objectively worse” than another. Whether a piece of music is “good” is a purely subjective opinion. Another way of putting this is that when somebody says “\\[x\\] is a good band,” all they are *actually* saying is “I personally enjoy \\[x\\]’s music.”\n\nI will refer to my view as “the subjective view,” and the opposing view as “the objective view.”\n\nProponents of the objective view argue that music can be objectively good or bad, and that some pieces of music are objectively better or worse than others. They might also believe that all music could, theoretically, be placed in a single hierarchy of quality, from worst to best. However, I believe that all of the arguments in favor of this view fall apart for various reasons. Here are some of those arguments, and my counter-arguments.\n\n1. **Music is better if it’s more influential.** In addition to the fact that “influence” is a nebulous concept that can’t be quantified, this view also implies that if music isn’t distributed widely enough to be influential, it isn’t good — or at least, that there’s a ceiling on how good it can be. It also implies that a piece of music can retroactively become “better” if its influence grows decades after it was recorded.\n2. **Music is better if it’s more emotionally evocative/evokes deeper emotions in the listener.** I hear this a lot, but it’s one of the easiest arguments to refute, because “emotionally evocative” is a purely subjective quality. A song that’s emotionally evocative to one person won’t necessarily be emotionally evocative to another; the same song will elicit two completely different emotional reactions from two different people, and there’s absolutely no way to litigate who is “right” or “wrong” in these situations.\n3. **Music is better if it accomplishes what the musician(s) was/were intending to accomplish.** There are a few issues with this. First and foremost, the listener has no way of knowing what the artist was trying to accomplish with any given song. We can speculate, but we can’t know — unless, of course, the songwriter gives an interview where they reveal what their goal was. But this would mean that we can’t assess the quality of a song in the absence of such an interview, which would mean we can’t assess the quality of \\~95% of songs. Moreover, this view implies that an artist can easily make a “good” song if they set a very low bar and then clear it. Van Morrison definitely accomplished what he was going for with his contractually-obliged album Contractual Obligation, but nobody would say that makes it a good album. Lastly, plenty of musicians create their music without any intention, and instead, view the creative process as one of exploration & discovery.\n4. **Music is better if it “stands the test of time.”** This is a vague phrase, but it’s basically pegging a song’s quality to its longevity. From this perspective, “Happy Birthday,” “99 Bottles of Beer” and “For He’s A Jolly Good Fellow” are three of the greatest songs of all-time, which I don’t think anybody believes. It also implies that no music is underrated, there are no “forgotten gems” and, again, that music can only be good if it has widespread distribution.\n5. **Music is better if the majority of people like it.** This runs into the same issue as Argument 1.\n\nI also have what I might call a meta counter-argument, which I'll try to explain now. I've listed five arguments for the objective view, along with counterarguments to each of them. But even if all my counterarguments were invalid, that still leaves the big problem of determining *which* of the five arguments I listed is the proper metric for assessing a song's objectivity (or maybe it's another one that I haven't listed). For instance, do we measure the \"objective quality\" of a song by assessing its influence over time, or by the degree to which it accomplished the artist's intentions? Why? How could we ever determine which of those is the \"true\" metric for measuring a song's objective quality? We couldn't. There is no factual or logical reason to believe that any metric for gauging \"objective quality\" is better or worse than any other metric.\n\nI have a lot more thoughts on this but I'm eager to hear what y'all think. Thanks for taking the time to read!\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all of the conversation, folks! I've really enjoyed discussing this with you. I've awarded a delta to /u/Boring-Outcome822 for [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152ajee/comment/jsdni8i/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) & explained my rationale in the response. I grappled with whether or not to give a delta, because my view hasn't \"changed\" in the classic sense; I still hold the same position as I did before re: the objectivity of music, as expressed in my original post. However, Boring-Outcome822 has made a very compelling argument that I've set up a situation in which my view is impossible to disprove. This wasn't my intention at all, but now I think I may have done exactly that. Which means that my view has, in that sense, changed.\n\nEDIT 2: I awarded a second delta to /u/3superfrank and [explained my reasoning here](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/152ajee/comment/jt0wa90/).

  "title": "CMV: Human Progress Was Gravely Harmed When Lincoln Didn’t Wipe Out The Confederacy And When Germany Didn’t Execute Hitler And His Conspirators After The Beer Hall Putsch",
  "selftext": "these are two junctures in relatively modern history that i consider flashpoints at which the arc of justice was horribly warped, actions - or inaction, however you wish to interpret it - whose consequences are being felt to this very day, affecting the march of human progress and the prospects of our survival as a species. \n\n1. Lincoln’s refusal to wipe out the confederacy with prejudice.  as you well know, the greatest military conflict, prior to the two world wars, that the us engaged in was its own civil war. this war resulted in over half a million dead americans, some historians arguing that almost a million died. despite revisionist claims painting it as a battle over state’s rights, the war was fought over the institution of slavery, the defense of which the south viewed to be a call to arms. these traitors were willing to split the country and murder their countrymen to preserve what they saw as their god given right to own black people, whom they viewed to be inferior and deserving of their captive station. at the end of the civil war, the leadership of the confederacy was generally left untouched and cleared of any wrongdoing. general lee, who should have hanged, was even allowed to become a professor at princeton university. jefferson davis, the leader of the confederacy who sought to overthrow the us government, was given a light sentence instead of treated as the traitor he was. after leaving prison, he returned to virginia, espousing the same hateful rhetoric that joined his seditious leadership of the confederacy, spearheading the terror that would meet the freed slaves living in the south. these men, along with everyone else who provided rhetorical and material support to the confederacy should have been wiped from american soil. instead, their racism continues to insinuate itself in american society, taking hold of one of the two parties that make up the american political system, and dominating the culture of the southern us. \n\n2. in 1923, adolf hitler staged a military demonstration in berlin that turned violent, resulting in 14 dead nazis and 4 police officers. but even before this famous attempt at a coup de’etat, the putsch, hitler stormed the city hall in munich, taking the mayor and city council hostage. this was exactly 100 years ago. when the bullets stopped stopped flying, and  order was restored, hitler was arrested. but instead of being executed for the attempted overthrow of germany’s government, he was sentenced to 5 years in minimum security prison - of which he only did a mere 8 months. this was before he burned the reichstag and executed the night of the long knives, the two events that would precipitate his solidification of power over germany and put him in a position to wage war against the free world and slaughter millions.  Hitler was joined in this coup de’etat by Heinrich Himmler, Wilhelm Frick, Julius Streicher, Rudolf Hess, and Hermann Goerring.  \n\n Himmler would become head of the notorious SS was the chief administrator of the concentration camps. \n\nJulius Streicher was a propagandist whose anti semitic words and incitement to genocide began to be published in 1923, on the pages of his newspaper DeStormer. \n\nWilhelm Frick became Hitler’s Minister of the Interior, overseeing key policies implemented by the Nazis, such as the Nuremberg laws. \n\nRudolf Hess was Hitler’s deputy fuhrer. He played a central role in formulating Hitler’s vision for the world, assisting him with Mein Kampf and drafting the legislation that would lead up to the holocaust. \n\nHermann Goering was head of Germany’s air force, the Luftwaffe, and considered the second most powerful man in Nazi Germany. \n\nnone of these men, all of whom comprising the core of the Nazi command, including Hitler himself, were handled by the judiciary as traitors who had just sought to overthrow the government. instead, the judges who they stood before treated them with the kind of leniency you’d expect men who committed terrorism and treason on the scale of which they where guilty would never be accorded.\n\nnow, imagine how different this world would be if the confederacy and anyone who supported it had been wiped out. a little known bit of trivia is that Hitler’s plans for racial conquest - of Germany and, eventually, the world - were largely informed by the treatment of black people in post-slavery America. the nuremberg laws were heavily influenced by jim crow.\n\nno debates over confederate flags or statues honoring traitors. no history books polluted with lies and historical revisionism. no politicians appealing to an idyllic past when blacks knew their place and southern hospitality consisted of lynching. how much better would race relations in the US be had the confederate traitors been wiped from existence? black people would have been given the reparations that were promised them in the walker of slavery ending. black communities in the south that were thriving hubs of culture and commerce - ultimately destroyed after federal troops left the south and effectively ended reconstruction  - might still exist to this day. \n\nhow different would the world look had hitler and his conspirators been executed; or, if not executed, imprisoned for decades. there wouldn’t have been a world war. the jews of europe would have lived in peace. the holiday would never have happened. millions of people wouldn’t have died. cities would not have had to be rebuilt. the military indusyrial complex may never have taken shape had the impetus of the world war 2 effort not given birth to it. yes, japan was still a problem, but a coalition that wasn’t spread thin by the european axis would have handily defeated japan. in fact, arguments have been made that japan’s territorial ambition was bolstered by reassurances she received from hitler. \n\nanyway, my point is that the lenient treatment of the confederacy and Nazi Germany slowed the march of human progress and continues harming us to this day.",

  "selftext": "Or I suppose a better way to put it that isn't really appropriate for a title: \"While Pluto does not meet the new official definition of a planet, I disagree with that definition and think that it is scientifically harmful.\"\n\nI do not believe there are 9 planets, but rather 12, as that includes the other Pluto-like bodies that have been discovered since the definition of a planet changed: Ceres, Makemake and Eris.\n\nThe reason I disagree with the new definition of a planet is I just see no utility to it other than to disregard an important region in a solar system in the face of scientific curiosity. The public is less willing to support funding a mission or study of a celestial body if they didn't grow up thinking of it as having importance. The \"ice dwarf\" planets could potentially hold key insight into the history of our solar system and life itself, and deserve a spotlight.\n\nA much better definition of a planet would be \"object orbiting a star that is massive enough to crush itself into a roughly spherical shape which is solid or has a solid core.\" Such a body should not have to \"push all other objects out of its orbital path\" in order to be considered significant in the face of astronomy.\n\nI see a lot of what I would even dare to call \"disinformation\" emerging from sources even such as PBS, where it is claimed that it would be impractical to consider Pluto a planet because there are several hundred similar objects. Like I said, there are only three other Pluto-like objects known to science. You can consider Pluto a planet without considering a car-sized meteor in its orbit a planet as well.",

  "selftext": "I met some people who mentioned to me that they are into BDSM, as they just talk about their everyday lives, \"Oh this is so-and-so, one of my kink buddies, she's coming along to the movies with us.\" They are normal people, but in the back of my mind I'm a little scared about what they do and why they do it.\n\nI met them because they were my (now ex) boyfriend's friends. He is now my ex because he was emotionally abusive, scary, didn't respect me, and absolutely didn't respect my consent. He was one of the first people to really explain BDSM to me, though he never actually did it with anyone before. His friends who are into it tried to explain a little but not enough for me to really understand.\n\nMy ex said that he has whips that he uses on himself, and it was healthy. He said he \"needed\" to flog himself, because he was abused as a child (his father whipped him) and it was therapeutic. He said that people do BDSM to re-live their traumas and overcome them. I found this very creepy and don't understand. He keeps the whips in a drawer in his room. He told me that his best friend (one who actually did BDSM, for decades) is a sadist and needs to do BDSM to function in society. He said that people need to get this out in a healthy way. He calls it healthy and necessary. \n\nWhile making out, a couple times he put his hands around my neck but didn't squeeze hard. He said a couple times before that he liked the idea of choking. I am absolutely not okay with being choked, especially by surprise, and I never before said I was okay with it. I told him to not put his hands around my neck and he got upset, and would try to do it again on another day. He also pulled my hair a few times during sex, without my consent and by surprise. It hurt and I didn't like it, but I just found it so out of place it was kinda funny, and I just bluntly said, \"Ow,\" in the least sexy tone I could manage. I told him I didn't like him pulling my hair. He also spanked me a lot of times without my consent. \n\nThe way he talked about BDSM scared me. He as a person scared me. He was 33 and I was 18, and he was my first kiss, and took my virginity. All sexual and intimate experiences were brand new to me.\n\nThat's some backstory about my opinion on BDSM. Back to the main point though. I looked at some BDSM stuff on reddit to try to see what it was, and it really scared me. It looked like stuff similar to the movie Saw, or other horror movies. People like pain, and need to experience it to be healthy and function? People like hurting other people? I don't know why this is sexy, I don't know why it's healthy. \n\nI want to be understanding and not judge people. I learned that if I'm really scared of something, often times it's my imagination making it out to be something worse than reality. Also my ex got really mad at me not liking BDSM, and said I was a bigot.\n\nI want to understand and not be scared. Please, help change my view.",

  "title": "CMV: Biden is right that Jews can’t be secure without a majority Jewish state, but the cost of achieving and maintaining a Jewish state in Israel is too high",
  "selftext": "In Biden’s recent statements about the Israeli Palestinian conflict, he acknowledged that Israel was bombing Gaza indiscriminately:\n\n>\\[Israel is\\] starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place.  \n>  \n>It was pointed out to me — I’m being very blunt with you all — it was pointed out to me that — by Bibi — that ‘Well, you carpet-bombed Germany.  You dropped the atom bomb.  A lot of civilians died.’  \n>  \n>I said, ‘Yeah, that’s why all these institutions were set up after World War Two to see to it that it didn’t happen again — it didn’t happen again.’”\n\nIn other words, Biden acknowledged that Israel is committing war crimes. In the same remarks, Biden said:\n\n>we’re not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process.  Not a single thing.\n\nHe stated that this commitment is because:\n\n>The goal is Israel’s security.  \\[…\\] many of you heard me say over the years: were there not an Israel, we’d have to invent one — we’d have to invent one. I believe, without Israel as a freestanding state, not a Jew in the world is safe.\n\n[https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/12/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-5/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/12/12/remarks-by-president-biden-at-a-campaign-reception-5/)\n\nBased on these remarks, here is my paraphrase of Biden’s views on the current Israel-Gaza war: maintaining an ethnocratic state where Jews are in control of the levers of power and use that power to benefit Jews (“Jewish state” from here on) is essential to ensuring the security of Jews worldwide. The security of Jews worldwide is extremely valuable, so war crimes against non-Jewish civilians are a tolerable cost if the alternative is imperiling the Jewish state. I think this view is likely a fairly common view among Israelis and Zionists worldwide.\n\nMy view is that:\n\n1. Biden is right. a Jewish State that has gotten past its growing pains (i.e. Israel after a hypothetical resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict) is likely the best way ensure the physical security of Jews worldwide.\n2. However, Establishing and maintaining a Jewish State requires significant moral and cultural compromises.\n3. The drawbacks are big enough that a person who does not ascribe greater value to the lives, rights, and security of Jews than they do to the lives, rights, and security of others should not support the maintenance of Israel’s Jewish character.\n\nMost of the arguments that I’m making here can be applied to the establishment and maintenance of any state that is organized around a specific ethnic, racial, religious, etc… group (I’m just going to simplify this to “ethnic group” from here on) on territory that is not already occupied exclusively by that group.\n\n1. **A Jewish state will ensure the security of Jews**\n\nI think that, generally speaking, the lesson that Zionists have taken from Jewish history is correct: populations that stand apart in some way from the rest of the society that they live in and that do not control significant political power (and therefore military power) are vulnerable to, and will likely experience, persecution. This experience is not unique to Jews and is incredibly widespread. In fact, wikipedia lists 31 events that have been called genocides in significant scholarship in the last century alone ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genocides)). Less egregious forms of discrimination and persecution are even more common.\n\nIf an ethnic group is in control of political and military power in the state (lets call it state X) that they live in, it’s highly unlikely that the government of that state will persecute that ethnic group. It is still possible for a foreign state to attack, but it will be possible for state X to use military force to resist that. If, as in Israel, the ethnic group that controls state X allows any member of their group worldwide to move there, then the existence of state X also protects from discrimination against that ethnic group in other nations because X can serve as a refuge. I think this is basically the rationale behind the creation of Israel (if you ignore the religious dimension that determined where Israel was established), and it seems sound to me.\n\n2. **Establishing and maintaining a Jewish State requires significant moral and cultural compromises**\n\nI don’t think it’s possible to **create** a state for a particular ethnic group without harming other ethnic groups unless the territory that is to become the new state is already almost exclusively occupied by the ethnic group in question. An example of that would be South Korea. The Korean Peninsula is incredibly ethnically homogenous, so South Korean politics is by default controlled by the Korean ethnic group (oligarchy issues aside) without the need to oppress or discriminate against any competing ethnic groups. When there are multiple ethnic groups in the territory that is to become the new state, for one group to take control of political and military power the other ethnic groups must be disenfranchised. I think there are multiple overlapping ways for the non-dominant ethnic groups to be disenfranchised (treat the descriptions that I give here as the definitions of the terms in this discussion. I’m not interested in arguing semantics.):\n\nA.\tMajority rule. If the ethnic group with power is already the overwhelming majority ethnic group. I think that this is probably the least problematic way other ethnic groups can be functionally disenfranchised. If an ethnic group is the overwhelming majority in the state, then they should have more political power than the minority ethnic group. However, to avoid setting the stage for ethnic conflict it is necessary to have institutions that ensure that minority ethnic groups do have a meaningful political voice and that their rights are respected (e.g. a constitution that limits the extent to which the majority can control the lives of the minority). I think that in a state that is explicitly formed to serve the interests of the dominant ethnic group it is unlikely that there will be robust institutional protections (when considering both the letter of the law and the enforcement of the law) for minority ethnic groups.\n\nB.\tEthnic cleansing. This is one of the standard ways of generating an ethnically homogenous state ([https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-11-24/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/why-this-top-expert-on-ethnic-conflicts-has-hope-for-israelis-and-palestinians/0000018c-0191-dca2-a9fd-659bf8590000?lts=1702442228142](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-11-24/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/why-this-top-expert-on-ethnic-conflicts-has-hope-for-israelis-and-palestinians/0000018c-0191-dca2-a9fd-659bf8590000?lts=1702442228142)). To generate conditions on the ground that will allow A, the dominant ethnic group can forcibly remove members of other ethnic groups from the territory that they plan to turn into their state.\n\nC.\tOppression. Allowing non-dominant ethnic groups to remain on the territory of the state, but actively suppressing their political voice so that they cannot influence the governance of the state. South African Apartheid, where non-whites were not allowed to vote, is a good example of this.\n\nD.\tGenocide. Destroying non-dominant ethnic groups. There are multiple ways to accomplish this. The most obvious is to kill members of those ethnic groups (e.g. the Holocaust and the concurrent genocides of other groups). Other ways are sterilizing members of those ethnic groups or forcibly assimilating them into the dominant ethnic group (e.g. Uyghur genocide, Native American/Australian reeducation schools). Genocide does not have to be complete. Even destroying a small fraction of the members of the non-dominant ethnic group can, particularly in combination with B and C, help secure political power for the dominant ethnic group. Genocide can also facilitate B and C by causing the non-dominant ethnic group to flee out of fear of victimization or by destroying the non-dominant ethnic group’s will/ability to resist oppression.\n\nSince Zionists began their mission to create Israel, Jews have never been the overwhelming majority ethnic group in the territory of historical Palestine (1800s: <10% Jewish; 1947: 32% Jewish; 2019: 52.1% Jewish; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic\\_history\\_of\\_Palestine\\_(region)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_history_of_Palestine_(region))). As a result, majority rule has never been a viable option to secure a Jewish State. That has meant that Zionists have had to use ethnic cleansing, oppression, and genocide (options B-D) to create and maintain Israel as a Jewish state. Even with Israel solidly established as a Jewish state, it will be necessary for Israel to continue to use B-D for the foreseeable future to maintain the Jewish character of the state. The ways for Israel to escape the need to do B-D in the long-term are either horrific or highly unlikely:\n\n* Massively increase the fraction of the population that is Jewish through very high fertility rates or Jewish immigration. Depending on how this is achieved, it could involve policies that I view as immoral. For example, discriminatory immigration policies (such as those already in place) that favor Jewish immigration over immigration of other ethnic groups even if the Jewish immigrants have no recent ties to the territory of Israel while the members of the other ethnic groups do. I regard these policies as similar (and in some ways more extreme) to historically racist immigration policies in the US ([https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/artifact/h-r-40-naturalization-bill-march-4-179](https://www.visitthecapitol.gov/artifact/h-r-40-naturalization-bill-march-4-179); [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/race-immigration-racism.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/opinion/race-immigration-racism.html); [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\\_citizenship\\_law#:\\~:text=Individuals%20born%20within%20the%20country,proficiency%20in%20the%20Hebrew%20language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_citizenship_law#:~:text=Individuals%20born%20within%20the%20country,proficiency%20in%20the%20Hebrew%20language)). These immigration policies also just haven’t been enough to increase the Jewish fraction of the population.\n* Complete or near-complete ethnic cleansing of the territory of Israel. If Israel manages to reduce the population of non-Jews in its territory to a very small fraction of its population, it will likely become unnecessary to engage in any further ethnic cleansing, oppression, or genocide to maintain the political supremacy of Jews.\n* Complete or near-complete genocide of non-Jews on Israeli territory for the same reasons.\n* Partition. If Israel manages to negotiate a two-state solution that allows Palestinians to have a state where a Palestinian government has supreme authority over their own state, Israel proper’s non-Jewish population is small enough that it is likely possible for them to avoid using B-D. Given the bad blood built up over the past century and the offers in previous peace negotiations, it is hard to imagine that this is achievable due to Israeli fears for their own security if they don’t maintain some level of control over a hypothetical Palestinian state. In my view, a Palestinian state that remains subject to Israeli control over some aspects of the state’s operation is just a less severe version of disenfranchisement and oppression of Palestinians.\n\nAssuming that Israel reaches the point where they have a Jewish state that is no longer engaged in B-D, it likely is not possible to **maintain** a Jewish state without discriminatory policies that I (and many other people, I think) would be staunchly opposed to in my own country.\n\n* To ensure the long-term Jewish character of the state, it will likely be necessary to institute policies that enshrine that character in Israeli institutions (e.g. the Israeli Nation-State Bill; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic\\_Law:\\_Israel\\_as\\_the\\_Nation-State\\_of\\_the\\_Jewish\\_People](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law:_Israel_as_the_Nation-State_of_the_Jewish_People)). Even in cases where these laws do not result directly in discriminatory action (as is the case for the Nation-State Bill), they will symbolically position non-Jews as secondary to Jews in Israel.\n* If Israel becomes a desirable place to live for non-Jews, discriminatory immigration policies will be necessary to ensure continued Jewish supremacy in Israel. Long-term change in the demographics of the state similar to what we're seeing in the US would be completely unacceptable in a Jewish state.\n* If the Non-Jewish share of the population grows due to differences in fertility, it will be necessary to reinstitute B-D to ensure continued Jewish supremacy in Israel. The need to maintain Jewish supremacy sets the stage for the development of an Israeli version of white genocide/white replacement theory ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White\\_genocide\\_conspiracy\\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_genocide_conspiracy_theory)). Unlike the modern US, because Israel is supposed to be Jewish, it is likely that acting on those views will be more socially and politically acceptable (and it’s already a problem in the US).\n* For Israel to be a refuge for persecuted Jews worldwide that retains its Jewish identity, Israel will need to maintain some combination of discriminatory immigration and asylum policies. What happens if there’s another event like WW2 and both Jewish and non-Jewish refugees seek asylum in Israel? Does Israel allow Jewish refugees to enter, but deny entry to black, Asian, Arab, etc... refugees? What if there is a flood of refugees that does not include Jews? Does Israel determine the number of refugees it will accept based on how it will affect the political power of Jews in the country? In other words, does Israel allow unlimited Jewish refugees when Jews are affected by the crisis, but severely limit the number of non-Jewish refugees when Jews aren't affected because they will change the balance of political power in Israel? These are questions that other countries (particularly in Europe) have recently struggled with, but if Israel is to maintain its Jewish character, discrimination must be built into the system.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is what ethnic nationalism and doing/experiencing all of the above does to the political culture of the resulting state. When considering this, it’s worth keeping in mind that an overwhelming majority of American Jews (the majority of the Jewish diaspora) support the democratic party ([https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-political-views/](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/u-s-jews-political-views/)), so they likely tend to prefer a state with left-leaning social values.\n\nMy understanding of Israel is that its most important governing principle is keeping the Jewish people safe from antisemitism. Regardless of how well-founded Jewish fear of antisemitism is, this governing principle is a fundamentally xenophobic one that relies on suspicion of the outsider to provide Israel with its *raison d’être*. It seems to me that building a state whose very essence is based in opposition to the “other” is buying a one-way ticket to right-wing extremism (on social issues). This is particularly true when the circumstances of the state’s creation have resulted in an ongoing ethnic conflict that continuously strengthens pre-existing xenophobic tendencies. The trajectory of Israeli politics is in line with that. For 32 of the last 46 years (since 1977), the Israeli prime minister has been a member of a right-wing party ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_prime\\_ministers\\_of\\_Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_Israel)), and the current government of Israel has been called its most right-wing ever.\n\nGiven the policies required to maintain Israel as a Jewish state, I have a hard time imagining that a version of Israel that embraces liberal social values will be able to retain its commitment to being a state characterized by Jewish political dominance. If Israel retains its commitment to Jewish political dominance, I have a hard time imagining that it will be the kind of place that liberal Jews will want to live.\n\n3. **The cost of a Jewish state is too high**\n\nHere’s a summary of the benefits and drawbacks of Israel as a Jewish state:\n\n*Benefits*\n\n* In times with minimal persecution of Jews (e.g. the modern era), an increased sense of security for all Jews from hypothetical future persecution.\n* If Jews experience severe persecution in the future, a state that will accept Jewish refugees and that has the military means to defend them.\n* At a hypothetical time in the future (when the current conflict has resolved), the existence of a place where Jews can be confident that they will not face persecution or violence from non-Jews.\n\nAs an aside, some people will probably argue that Israel has already served as a refuge for hundreds of thousands of Mizrahi Jews expelled from countries across the Middle East and North Africa, which should count as a tangible benefit. This point is complicated by the fact that they probably wouldn’t have been expelled if Israel hadn’t been created, which makes that argument somewhat circular: “We need to create Israel to protect Jews” --> Arab countries expel Jews in retaliation for the creation of Israel --> “We were right to create Israel to protect Arab Jews.” Because of that circularity, I haven’t included it as a benefit.\n\n*Drawbacks*\n\n* Some combination of ethnic cleansing, oppression, and genocide of the Palestinians has been and will be necessary to establish and maintain the Jewish character of the state for the forseeable future. This has involved and will continue to involve massive suffering for the Palestinian people.\n* After the initial period of ethnic cleansing, oppression, and genocide has ended, it may be necessary to resume those policies in the future depending on demographic trends.\n* Current insecurity for Jews and Israeli Palestinians in the Jewish state due to violent conflict with Palestinians and neighboring states.\n* Current insecurity for Jews worldwide as people inappropriately hold all Jews responsible for Israeli actions.\n* The final form of the Jewish state will be institutionally racist by necessity.\n\nTo determine whether to support Israel as a Jewish state, we need to weigh these benefits and drawbacks. For me, this seems relatively straightforward:\n\nThe benefits of having a Jewish state are largely hypothetical right now. The only large scale violence towards Jews right now is taking place in Israel and the Occupied territories because Israel hasn’t gotten past its violent start-up phase. In the rest of the world, Jews are generally safer than they currently are in Israel. For them, Israel is basically an insurance policy.\n\nOn the other hand, the drawbacks of Israel as a Jewish state are largely being felt right now:\n\n* The initial ethnic cleansing of historic Palestine has resulted in a refugee crisis that has yet to resolve after 75 years because a return of the refugees would eliminate Israel’s Jewish majority.\n* Ongoing oppression and ethnic cleansing of mostly peaceful Palestinians in the West Bank because incorporating them into the state of Israel would substantially reduce Israel’s Jewish majority.\n* Israel’s conflict with Hamas has resulted in unbelievable levels of human suffering in Gaza.\n* The ethnic nationalism and xenophobia that are at the core of Israel’s Jewish identity are making Israel increasingly illiberal and are weakening democratic institutions in Israel proper.\n\nOn one side of the scale, we have hypothetical benefits to Jewish people that materialize only if their current host countries turn against them. On the other side of the scale, we have actual human suffering that is happening right now to Palestinians. I like to use an insurance analogy to think about this problem: let’s say that Person A has the option of claiming a health insurance policy that requires them to feed Person B a life-altering or lethal dose of cyanide now. In my opinion, it doesn’t matter how prone Person A is to health issues – that’s an unacceptable trade-off because the severe consequences to Person B are guaranteed, whereas the benefits to Person A are only possible. It seems to me that there are only a couple of ways to conclude that it’s better to claim the insurance policy: (1) if you place greater value on the health of Person A than on the health of person B or (2) If you think the expected harm to Person A from whatever health issue they develop is going to be much worse than the harm to Person B from cyanide. For (2) The Person A’s potential health issues would have to be both very severe (i.e. worse than cyanide) and very likely. In those two cases, the expected benefit to Person A might be of greater value than a guaranteed detriment to person B.\n\nThis is how I think about the value of Israel as a Jewish state. I think that Holocaust 2.0 in the US is extremely unlikely, and short of holocaust 2.0 it’s hard for me to imagine something worse than what’s happening to Palestinians now. I also view Jewish and Palestinian lives as equal in value. As a result, I view the current suffering of Palestinians as an intolerable cost to secure the safety of Jews in the future, especially if you end up with an illiberal state that’s fundamentally xenophobic and discriminatory in the end anyway. To conclude otherwise, you must either view Jewish well-being as more valuable than Palestinian well-being, which is racist, or you must think that the American Holocaust is imminent, which doesn't seem plausible to me.\n\nI’m not interested in arguing semantics: I don’t care if what’s happening should be called “genocide” or “ethnic cleansing.” These were the easiest words for me to use to describe what I’m talking about.",

  "selftext": "This CMV is inspired by an exhibition of Hieronymus Bosch paintings I went to. The organisers had arranged copies of all his famous works, including ones too delicate to travel or held by institutions that would never have loaned out the originals. The exhibition was free, and because the copies only cost a few thousand Euros each, they didn't have to be protected by glass and velvet ropes: ordinary visitors were able to get close, and even open and close the triptychs.\n\nI think this should be the model for all museums\n\n1. There is no added value to displaying an original artefact: Almost no visitors can tell the difference between a good quality copy and the original, and certainly not under glass from 4 feet away (as required for security).\n2. There is added value to displaying reproductions: Exhibitions are cheaper and can happen in lots of places at the same time, so more people can experience these beautiful artefacts (and also poorer people and those who live further from Global North metropoles). Reproductions are also more robust and so people can experience them in a more normal way (normal lighting, low security, a less ritualised/pretentious experience, etc)\n3. Many art works and other artefacts have a role in the national stories of multiple modern societies. This creates bitter zero-sum justice disputes about where the artefacts belong. But if we drop the fetishisation of authenticity, we can at least share the experience of these artefacts between all the societies that claim an interest in them. (I know that won't end the arguments, but it might draw some of the poison)\n4. The original artefacts do of course have added value for expert study. But this does not require them to be publicly displayed, and in fact at the moment such display competes with their availability for study.\n\nPutting this all together: Museums should see their responsibility as 1) collaborating in the creation and display of high quality reproductions of their holdings so as many people as possible around the world can experience them and 2) making their original holdings as available as possible to expert study (which might include placing them in more appropriate spaces, such as universities). \\[I haven't thought too hard about the financial sustainability of this new ethic, but licensing fees seem an obvious route\\]\n\n**EDIT:** u/No-Produce-334 **has persuaded me that most current museum goers would not be interested enough in reproductions to visit. I still think that my proposal would improve access to the experience of viewing beautiful and interesting artefacts - which is what museums should be for. But any move towards this should be much more incremental than I originally envisaged and include much more work on re-educating museum visitors and reaching out to non-traditional museum goers.

This weakens my CMV but does not completely change my mind. I think of this via the metaphor of reading a novel in translation. Yes, it is not the same as reading the original. But it can nevertheless be a valuable and real experience of art, and, moreover, making a novel available in translation allows it to reach many many more people who don't have the time to learn the original language. Likewise, my proposal may not be able to give people quite the same experience as viewing the original (as I first claimed), but it can still provide enormous value to many more people. At the least, museums with in demand assets should make them available for copying to display elsewhere even while (following** u/spastikatenpraedikat's **successful challenge) they continue to display the originals as much as possible.**",

The way stalemates are broken usually come down to a revolutionary change in tactics, or technology.  It's clear the US West's support for Ukraine has its limits, and unless we want to seriously arm them with long range missiles, aircraft, and mass produce artillery, this conflict isn't going to change.  \n\nOne option which has not been considered is a full scale attack on Russia itself.  The \"West\" has largely discouraged attacks inside Russia over fears of Russia escalating the conflict, however, Russia has proven itself over and over that it has no means to do so.  \n\n1. The Russian/Ukrainian border is lightly defended.  Russia has over 95% of its total military inside Ukraine, it has had to leave its borders lightly defended as a result.  Ukraine has proved this time and time again by launching several raids into Russian border towns over the summer, one of which lasted over 3 days before being pushed back into Ukraine.  The Wagner group proved internal Russian security is lacking during Prighozin's coup.  \n2. Because the border is lightly defended, and a ground invasion unlikely, Ukraine would have the element of surprise against a lightly armed Russian defense force.  This would allow Ukraine to hopefully make rapid gains and dig in before Russia could organize a counter attack.  Russia would be forced to pull resources from occupied Ukrainian territory to defend itself, weakening its defenses against the Ukrainian army inside Ukraine.  \n3. It would better protect Ukrainian border cities such as Kharkiv from constant Russian shelling.  While Russia has not been able to directly threaten Kharkiv after Ukraine successfully defended the city and later pushed East, it still lobs random missiles and artillery at the city.  \n4. Any ground invasion would not have the goal of regime change or Russian capitulation, more so leverage in negotiations.  It's simply unrealistic to think Ukraine would be able to advance on Moscow or significantly deep inside Russia, any land invasion would be limited to border towns, and possibly Belgorod.  \n5. The US has more than indicated it would join the conflict on Ukraine's side if Russia is to use nuclear weapons.  While invading Russia itself would be an escalation on Ukraine's part, it is far from the level of using nuclear weapons, and nothing the Russian military would not be able to conventionally manage.  Russia has also not escalated the conflict despite numerous shipments of high tech Western weapons, German and American main battle tanks, and the US preparing to send F16s.  Ukraine has also launched numerous attacks inside of Russia with no change in Russian tactics either.  I don't see why this would change the status quo.  \n6. It would have a destabilizing effect on Russia, possibly forcing Putin to announce full mobilization, which would lead to another wave of young Russian men emigrating.  The conflict would still be far away from most Russian cities where daily life would not change much, therefore I believe the \"rally around the flag\" effect would be limited.  To back this up, Ukraine in the past few months conducted a series of drone attacks on Moscow, and the population remained apathetic to the war.  If Ukraine attacking your city with drones was not enough to get you to join the military, I doubt a few villages on the Ukrainian border being occupied by Ukraine will change your mind.  \n7. If both sides are too dug in, this would give Ukraine the chance to strengthen its position when negotiations occur.  Russia will want its land back, as does Ukraine, sounds like a fair trade to me.

  "title": "CMV: USA Conservative politician strategically, and very successfully, compresses Liberal \"policy execution\" and liberal motives such that invalidation of the former is tantamount to invalidation of the latter. Liberals fall into this trap consistently by defending the policy instead of the motive.",
  "selftext": "So to be clear I'm making the following claims:\n\n1. Conservative political strategy, moreso than Liberal political strategy, revolves around tightly coupling policy implementation to the validity of the motive for the policy (for example using an undesirable side effect of Affirmative Action as messaging that anti-racism is itself a corrupt idea). One reason for this bias is that Liberal policy intrinsically involves more bureaucratic infrastructure, and therefore more points of failure. Conservative politicians just have more ammunition here, as their policies tend to involve deregulation and reduction in services.\n2. For emotional and ego reasons, Liberals tend to either fall for, or ignore, the logical fallacy baked into Conservative critique of Liberal policies, and a lot of them go right to a Scorched-Earth defense of the policy being attacked (the critic is racist, or homophobic, the conservative policy was worse, etc.). While the Liberal counter-attacks concerning the character of the critic or the preferability of their polices are frequently accurate, used as a counter-argument they're often highly counterproductive. The harm is that by going all in on defending the policy you've already agreed to the tight-coupling (or 'compression' from the title) of policy and motive.\n3. This makes the gamesmanship of convincing moderate voters incredibly easy for Conservatives. Just find an example of a time when a Liberal policy failed in execution, which is not hard to do because liberals can be counted on to crank out a lot of policy, and you can invalidate the point of view of the constituency that backed the policy by criticizing the example and then letting most of the Liberal voice react by calling the critics bigots (which, again, they may well be).Going back to Affirmative Action, imagine an Asian family that thinks of themselves as basically tolerant and agrees (as Asian people no less!) with the principles of anti-racism, but nevertheless feels like they're being actively discriminated against by the admissions policies of a cherished university. When Liberals play into the dichotomy of \"for Affirmative Action is the good, non-racist, position, and against Affirmative Action is the evil, racist, position\", they put the aforementioned Asian family in a very strange place with respect to how they vote and how they see themselves.\n4. Imagine then if the defense of liberal policies was rooted more heavily in evidence-based argumentation. You could imagine (with the right evidence) saying to the aforementioned Asian family, \"Yeah, I realize you were screwed by Affirmative Action, I'm sorry. But here's why your sacrifice will be worth it in 50 years when we don't have race-based underclasses in the US anymore.\"(I realize I'm about to get pilloried by Conservatives who are going to say \"yeah the evidence won't show that\" ... and maybe they'll be right about that? I have no idea. My point is that with evidence in hand, you'd have a much stronger argument.)\n5. Likewise, I think mocking Conservatives for gun culture, shaming them for gun violence or getting into yet another argument over a close read of the 2nd Amendment are actively counterproductive avenues of argumentation with respect to ending gun violence. I think the more effective argument in the ecosystem of pro-gun-control arguments is that gun violence in America is an unacceptable fracture in our society and if you look at the gun control posture of other jurisdictions around the world, its a solvable problem.\n6. TL;DR: Liberals have a huge problem with admitting they're asking people to make sacrifices, so all Conservatives have to do to win moderate voters is prove the existence of negative side-effects of liberal policy.",

  "selftext": "Maybe judicial review is tolerated because it has \"worked out\" for 230 years so why mess with it? Because the powers the court has belong to Congress and our elected representatives. For too long the judicial branch has had few checks on its power. Power these justices are not entitled to. Article III of the Constitution, which grants its powers, is very narrow and explicit in terms of establishing the Court's jurisdiction. \n\nI am not someone who believes this because of *Dobbs*  but it certainly reinforces it. I have believed this pretty much since I first learned about Marbury. For a court dominated by so-called textualists, I find it amusing Marbury is their sole justification. The Supreme Court's website silently concedes this by citing *Marbury* and not the \"judicial review clause\" of the Constitution.\n\nSo it's high time Congress wakes the hell up, takes back its power, and reverse the continued atrophy of legislative power (the most democratic, gerrymandering aside) and halt the expansion of judicial and executive power. We need a 28th Amendment that declares there is no \"judicial review\", voiding Marbury and clarifying that any delineating powers beyond the specifications of Article III jurisdiction belong to Congress alone. \n\nAnd no, doing this will not upend civil rights as we know it. The court itself hasn't been pro-individual liberties, excluding guns and religion, since the 1970s. For every *Obergfell* and *Miranda* we get I can cite 2 more where the court undermines individual freedom and our government. \n\nDobbs upended a right but that's too easy. We have Dred Scott v. Sanford, which was not only judicial overreach it invalidated the Missouri Compromise and all but guaranteed we would be on track for the Civil War. The court also checked the Union's wartime powers, which Lincoln thankfully ignored until Taney died. We also have Buck v. Bell, where the court said eugenics wasn't unconstitutional (this hasn't been fully overruled), or Korematsu v. US where the court approved FDR's Executive Order to imprison Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Seriously, anyone who thinks judicial review at the level Congress has tolerated protects our rights is delusional. Korematsu has also not even overruled either. Roberts says it was \"wrong\" and \"exceeded the presidents powers\" in the *Hawaii v. Trump* decision, but still doesn't overrule it. \n\nAnd of course Bush v. Gore, where the court voted along partisan lines to halt a 537 vote recall in Florida. They overruled the state Supreme Court, which undermines the concern with \"judicial restraint\", another myth the court is said to follow. It's not secret they voted along party lines either, Justice Sandra Day O'Conner was upset at the thought of having to \"wait 4 more years before [my husband and I] could retire back to Arizona\". In a 2013 interview she later recanted taking the case and said the court shouldn't have bothered. A little late for that Sandra. \n\nAt minimum I support a proposal Theodore Roosevelt made of allowing a citizen ballot referendum to overrule the Supreme Court. I'd also enjoin the court for 10 years so they can just recreate it under a different case brought before them. \n\nAs the Danco/FDA affair out of the District Court of Northern Texas shows this is too much power for an unelected body, fully insulated from the consequences of their decisions, to have.",

  "title": "CMV: There's no good argument for incest to be legal",
  "selftext": "Edit: The title is meant to be There's No Good Argument For Incest to be Illegal \n\nThis is probably my most controversial opinion. I can't genuinely see any good argument for making incest illegal. There are many arguments but not good ones. Let me point out my main problems with some of them.\n\nIt's gross and disgusting: This is not even an argument against incest. I find the concept of open relationships and polyamory bizarre and wierd. I cannot for the life of me, figure out how someone finds any happiness in this. Especially, open relationships, I find creepy and weird, best confined to the Porn screen. But that doesn't mean they should be illegal. My disgust against open relationships cannot translate into them being illegal. Also 100 years ago, we found miscgenation gross and disgusting. 50 years ago, we found homosexuality gross and disgusting. If they weren't good enough reasons to ban those acts, this isn't a good reason to ban incest.\n\nThere will be deformed babies: First of all, incest isn't inbreeding. Incest means having sexual relations with a close family member. It says nothing about having children. Moreover, this is essentially a eugenic argument. We should ban people from reproducing because they have flawed genes. Now, it isn't immediately obvious that eugenics is bad. But then, there's a very strong case for banning people with say, Huntingtons from reproducing. In a woman with Huntingtons, the threat of passing down the disease is at minimum 25% compared to 3-10% for incest. Surely by this logic, people with genetic deformations should be banned from reproduction. \n\nThere is sexual abuse: This is the most common argument against the legalization of incest. But this is doesn't make sense. Because incest statute doesn't ban abuse, it bans incest. These laws make no distinction between consensual and non consensual acts. So if you want incestous abuse, to be prosecuted separately, why shouldn't we add a clause which stipulates that it's only illegal if there's no consent? One person literally said it will make prosecution difficult as you would have to prove lack of consent beyond a reasonable doubt. If you want the standard of proof for sex crimes to be lowered, why not advocate for that? Moreover, power differentials exist in every relationship. Except for a rare few like doctor patient, none are illegal. \n\nThe sanctity of the family: This again is not in any way compelling. Yes, can incestuous relationships endanger parent child or sibling relationships? Yes. But so can everything else and we don't ban that. Wills produce immense animosity and enmity amongst siblings. Should we make that illegal? If two siblings open a business together, it can massively complicate the relationship. If two siblings cohabitate together, it can massively complicate the relationship. Should we make that illegal as well? Adults should have the ability to make choices they want to. Even if they are quite risky. \n\nI mean, what's the practical difference between having sexual relations with your childhood bestfriend and having sexual relations with your sibling? If one is legal and adorable, why is the other one suddenly grooming and abuse? Parent Child incest is a grey area since grooming and sexual abuse is a real possibility. But surely after a point it's okay. If a 43 year old has sex with his or her parent, how is it grooming?\n\nI don't see any good arguments for making incest illegal.",

  "selftext": "Here are the highlights of my notes on this. Other topics may overlap:\n\nWhen a person decides to be in a relationship with you the implication is that you’re special because the person chose you exclusively out of all the potential options open to them.\n\nWhen they leave you, the implication is that you’re not special anymore. Or that someone else (probably their new partner) is more special than you.\n\nI think the understanding that most effectively frees a person from that pain is the realization that they were never really special in the first place…\n\nAnd that neither was the other person.\n\nAnd EVERYONE is playing this “special” game…EVERYONE.

There are thousands—millions—of people that a person can and will find attractive…\n\nThat a person can and will be able to have genuine pleasurable connections with…\n\nPeople that they could see themselves being in relationships with. Some more than others…\n\nWhat’s happening is that people don’t realize this. They’re not seeing this. And they believe the opposite of this. That there IS a “soulmate” out there. Or that the person they were with was “the one”. All while playing this “special” game. It’s a recipe for pain.\n\nSo there’s shock and pain and confusion and egos bruised and feelings of not feeling special when a person cheats or leaves the relationship for another person or even if that person just makes another connection with someone else. Because you don’t feel special anymore when one of these things happen.\n\nIf people can see the game for what it is, perhaps they can pursue monogamy free from pain and misery because they will wisely keep it at arms length.\n\nIt must be remembered that people are opportunistic. And that relationships are a value exchange and always will be. People don’t see this or they forget this and feel blindsided, betrayed and discarded when someone leaves them for someone offering more value (in the form of better feelings and/or material things)\n\nIf there is a soulmate out there. I think it’s just a person you’ll have the strongest kind of connection with. It’s not just one person but the likeness of you meeting 2 is probably close to none. It’s the rarest level of connection someone with your wiring can have with someone else. \n\nThere’s billions of people in the world, so there’s probably quite a few of these people alive but obviously it’s still unlikely to meet one. They could be in a country on the other side of the planet. In prison. Married to someone else. Anywhere! But you don’t have to have the soulmate connection to have a happy long term relationship with someone.\n\n\nIf children were raised to be privy to these truths, I seriously believe they’d be able to easily stomach multiple breaks up with ease. It’s an optimistic view to me really. There’s always more people out there that you can have a long lasting and fulfilling physical and emotional connection with. Even more fulfilling than the person you may be with right now. So if the day ever comes that they’re no longer with you for whatever reason, no need to be pessimistic about the future.",

  "title": "CMV: Saying that sex is a physiological need is not only wrong, but dangerous.",
  "selftext": "Sexuality has been a major and contentious topic for as long as there have been humans. Depending on your environment, sex-related topics are omnipresent in news, media, businesses, households and more. Many people think about sex on a constant basis; to the point that their urge for sex is more important than the urge for homeostasis or security. Some have even included that sex is a basic need that the human body needs to function, but that simply is not true.\n\nFood, water, oxygen, thermoneutrality, and sleep are actual physiological needs. Being free from deadly viruses or injuries is also a physiological need. If a human being, or any other animal for that matter, goes without any of those needs being met for a relatively short amount of time, they die. As great as sexual intercourse is, it is not a need. It might be an innate biological urge, but it is not a need. Many people have gone their entire lives without ever having sex. Catholic nuns don’t have sex. Buddhist monks don’t have sex. Eastern Orthodox bishops don’t have sex. Hindu/Jain ascetics don’t have sex. Eunuchs and people with missing genitals don’t have sex. Asexuals obviously and generally speaking, don’t have sex. Some of the greatest thinkers in the world like Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, Immanuel Kant, and more probably died virgins. [At least 14% of American men](https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/health/who_are_the_40-year-old_virgins_/1839675/) over 40 are virgins, and sadly that number is more likely to increase as time goes on.My point is that you don’t need a sexual experience to have a long, fulfilling, and exceptional life. Nor are you some bottom-tier unlovable wretch if you reach X age without having a sexual encounter. If nobody around you wants to fuck you, that sucks but you will definitely survive. If somebody or some government/organization starved you or dehydrated you or asphyxiated you, they wouldn’t be just denying your human rights; they would be outright committing murder. And people would justifiably do whatever they can in order to not get murdered.\n\nHopefully, you now see why equating sex with a physiological need is dangerous. If sex truly was a need, than incels and lonely people wouldn’t be silly and immoral for feeling entitled to sex; they would be the morally righteous ones. If sex truly was a need, than society doing nothing to help sexually satisfy them and instead shaming them would be a human rights violation! The idea that a man needs to have sex in order to be a real man, and any man that hasn’t had X sex partners by Y age is some pathetic loser who should just rot, is one of the most harmful thought processes in the modern world. That thought process leads to increased rates of depression, suicide, homicide, mass shootings, sexual assault, human trafficking, and many other horrifying phenomena. If sex is a need, virgin shaming is essentially no different than ridiculing famine victims or drought victims, and said victims would understandably be extremely resentful to those who insult them.\n\nIf you’re in a romantic relationship and your lover has a lower sex drive than you; I sympathize, but this thread is not for you. This thread is about those who feel sexual activity is essential for a human life, and/or think that demographic decreases in sexual encounters is a major catastrophe. To change my view, you have to prove that sexual relationships are a necessity for a healthy individual’s existence. And for the love of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, DO NOT cite Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. That theory has been criticized for decades and lacks supporting evidence.",

  "selftext": "The police and military attract a certain kind of people, that i think is common knowledge. The ones that do it for the unpunished violence. I feel like, if we punished every soldier that hides behind \"Was just following orders\" more severly, we would start to finally see a change in the military. Until then, more of these kind of people will be attracted to this job.\n\nFor example, Vietnam. The massacre of My Lai was only the one that got the most publicity, as it was only one in a long series of massacres that were even more brutal. It was a common occurance for South Vietnam and US soldiers to kill and rape civilians, and many of their fellow soldiers, even if didn't participate, did nothing to stop them. In fact, men like Hugh Thompson Jr. were the exception, willing to shoot his own comrades to stop the atrocity. If the soldiers that knowingly did nothing to stop the others or the ones that directly participated, received harsher sentences, these kind of people would not see the military as the way to let loose and commit war crimes, and less would enlist to it.\n\nAnother example: Guantanamo. Today we can say the situation is a lot better, at least when viewed from outside. But in the earlier days, doctors and US soldiers tortured people from all over the world, with the only charge against them being that of terrorism, but without a trial. If it is ever closed, the military and the government could finally do something right and punish every soldier, from the higher ups to the simple guard, that let torture go on, ordered it or partecipated directly in. The defense of \"Just following orders\" was not even valid at Nuremberg, so why would it be now? Even if the ones that they did it against were ALL terrorists(something that i think can be true, especially after many were given clearance to be sent back to their countries), they still did inhuman actions against defenseless people, that consisted of sodomy, torture and humiliation.\n\nEven if punished, soldiers recieve laughable punishments, nothing compared to what they have done. And most of the time the ones that are punished are the scapegoats, the ones stupid enough to be caught and be the recipient of all public hate, while the rest continue committing atrocities.\n\nThe military, at least for now, is only a collection of inhuman, cruel and monstruos people that participate in atrocities, order atrocities, and silently endorse atrocities.\n\nWhile i think my view is just, i feel like it might have its flaws. That is why i decided to post it here. Also, while i only used the US military as an example, i was talking about every military worldwide. My intention was not to single out the US military.",

Even if this happens the car would be at fault because bikes in the lane have the right of way.\n\nThis doesn’t make sense to me because if I’m driving and turning right that requires me to slow down. If the biker is further back and maintains their speed (18-20mph) this means unless they are close to me I wouldn’t see them in my mirror. As I start turning my mirror view would turn *away* from the bike lane and my passenger window would turn towards it and by the time I would see them I’d be in the bike lane already and they would crash. This is in addition to me needing to monitor everything else.\n\nMeanwhile a biker going the same way only has to look at the blinkers ahead and anticipate what’s going to happen and slow down/stop. So if they crash into the car that uses its blinker it’s their fault. There’s  the added risk of a car turning from the other lane as well so bikes should be prepared to yield for that as well.

  "title": "CMV: Financially savvy middle-class families should pay out inheritance to their children over the life of the child as opposed to give it to them when they die.",
  "selftext": "The current model seems to be that Grandma and Grandpa work and work until they can comfortably retire, and then when they die, leave their wealth to their children. For arguments sake, lets look at a middle class family and also say that when Grandma and Grandpa died, they were able to give their children (Mom and Dad in this scenario) the family house, as well as $2 million in cash/investments.\n\nThe \"problem\" here, is that Grandma and Grandpa have not maximized the \"value\" of the money that they gave their kids. What I mean by that is that their children (Mom and Dad) are probably in their 50's at this point. Meaning they have established careers, families, house, car, etc. They have made it 50 years without needing that money, so $2 million probably does very little for them at this point. The grandchildren are probably late teenagers and headed to college soon, so it doesn't make sense to buy and move into a bigger/better house. In many cases the grandchildren could already be through college, so either Mom and Dad helped pay for it out of their pocket, or the grandkids already took out loans that have been accumulating interest. Since the grandkids are grown, there are less opportunities for the family to use that money towards vacations to spend time together. The cycle repeats as the grandkids receive their inheritance at age 50 as well, and this giant useless inheritance that continues to grow just gets passed from generation to generation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy alternative model would have Grandma and Grandpa essentially giving away as much money to their own kids as they can - without impacting the lifestyle they desire to have. Let's say Grandma and Grandpa had 2 children around age 35. As they approach 55, lets say they have $300k in 401K, are able to save/invest $20k/year after expenses, and the kids begin turning 20ish years old. \n\nOne way to begin paying out inheritance could be at significant age milestones such as:\n\n18 y/o - $5,000\n\n21 y/o - $10,000\n\n25 y/o - $25,000\n\n30 y/o - $50,000\n\n35 y/o - $100,000 (The children start to have their own kids and Grandma/Grandpa are about 70y/o at this point)\n\nThe total of these expenditures would be $380,000. Over that same timeframe though, the parents would have been able to save/invest another $300k *if their salaries never increased over 15 years* (so probably have saved more like $500k). The parent's 401K would have likely at least doubled to $600k, they would likely own their house at this point (meaning their monthly expenses are minimal), both be eligible to withdraw social security, and they would likely have received inheritance from their own parents dying by now. All this to say, they should be set for a long and happy retirement.\n\nWhat this model does is afford their children life enhancement. Meaning they don't have to go into debt to buy that car at 21. Maybe try starting a business at 25 with the extra cash injection. Maybe go back to get a Master's Degree at 30 to increase their future earning potential, without going into debt. Maybe put a downpayment into a nice house at 35 so they can begin building equity in a home as oppose to paying rent to some landlord for 10 more years.\n\nSince the money is \"more useful\" to someone in their 20's or 30's, the parents are enhancing their children's lives more by paying out inheritance as the children grow, as oppose to plopping a lump sum on them when they are 50 y/o and past their prime career/life building years.\n\nAs grandma and grandpa near the end of their own lives, they take a closer look at their finances to see what more they can give. Maybe their investments have grown such that they don't even spend as much as they are getting in market returns each year. So they decide to give another $150,000 to each of their kids when they are 45 years old. Now their grandkids can go to nice summer camps, nice vacations, see the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main rebuttal to this argument would of course be that life can have unexpected turns, and so there is risk in giving away too much money that the parents might need to live off of later in retirement. But that is why I specified \"financially savvy\" and \"middle-class\" in the original title. This model is not for parents living paycheck to paycheck or with major costly health issues. It is meant for healthy people who are good at managing their finances and are expecting inheritance from their own parents before the time they themselves reach retirement age.",

  "selftext": "Edit (changes): I no longer believe it’s on of the best reasons in genral, but I still think it is a very good reason and probably the best reason that is not based in sexism or just completely ending the draft. \n\nSexual assault and rape predominantly happens specifically from men raping women with all other combinations being a rarity. This is still a prevalent problem in todays society, and it is even more likely in dangerous situations like war when tensions run high. The more isolated/likely to face enemy capture/ect, the unit a women is placed into, the more she would have to worry about not just death and injury, but being target of rape. Because of this, asking a women to enlist is a much greater burden than asking men. \n\nIt would be a very bad idea to put the average woman in a mixed gender prison just like it would be a bad idea to put the average women in a mixed race army.\n\nSure some women do fine in the army, but these are women who view themselves to be capable of the role they choose. They are probably much more physically capable than the average woman, and are able to choose a department that has acceptable risks for them. A daft eliminates this ability for this self selection of capability and choice of department.\n\nSure this could be mostly mitigated if the draft of women only forced them to participate in less dangerous roles where sexual assault and physical capability was less of a concern. But just extending the same draft to women is too extreme of a burden.\n\nEdit: this is specifically an argument against women being required to participate in the same draft that men do with the same requirements. If their positions were limited to logistical and noncombat orientated roles, this would be mostly mitigated. However, these are already the more desirable rolls. And if a super big important war came up, I think they’d probably be enough people that wanted to contribute to the war effort, but didn’t want to face the risk of death or serious bodily injury that would easily fill these logistical roles. Considering this my argument only applies to a draft of men and women where women have the same types of participation as men.",

However I don't think they're inherently bad at all and can even be good. To me, participation trophies are fine as long as A) it's clearly demarked as a participation trophy and the winning team gets a bigger prize in addition to it and B) the event is fairly low-stakes. The existence of participation trophies inspires kids to get up and try again if they fail. Let's say some kid joins the Little League soccer team and really busts their ass trying to win, giving 110%; in the final game his team loses by one point. If they're told \"you suck lol tough luck\" they'd probably lose motivation because their hard work did not pay off. In the next season they would likely choose to not join or do the bare minimum instead because they put in all that work for nothing.\n\nHowever if instead they got a cheap Dollar Tree trophy/ribbon they'd know that all their work still led to *something*, even if it wasn't quite what they wanted (the bigger trophy). They'd be more likely to get back up and give it another go.

Her waist is like 2mm thick. But nobody is asking where deedees organs are because she isn't sexualised so it doesn't fit the narrative that art should be realistically proportioned. \n\n\"How can she fight in that?\" I mean, it's mortal kombat. A game where you can punch through a 220lbs guys chest like it's wet tissue paper but you draw the line at fighting in heels? It reads like \"Games are supposed to be realistic when it fits my narrative but when it has nothing to do with the narrative I'm trying to push then they can be completely unrealistic.\" \n\nRemember Lara Croft in the reboot where people are like \"She has normal size tits!\" she already did. Look at [Tomb Raider: Underworld.](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/e2314d4a-d817-462f-a209-59eb1d6cce5b/deibcuz-1f7182d8-6b1b-4bae-af0c-0045a66eedb4.jpg/v1/fill/w_1280,h_1707,q_75,strp/tomb_raider_underworld__sense_of_wonder_by_irishhips_deibcuz-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MTcwNyIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcL2UyMzE0ZDRhLWQ4MTctNDYyZi1hMjA5LTU5ZWIxZDZjY2U1YlwvZGVpYmN1ei0xZjcxODJkOC02YjFiLTRiYWUtYWYwYy0wMDQ1YTY2ZWVkYjQuanBnIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTEyODAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.UJx4YNLXGilsIGDJoEcZ-yU57OJw11AB10ksVCNOlsQ) Probably no bigger than a D cup.

Look at crossfit. It isn't hard to find somebody who looks like that. But it isn't even about realism. It's because she's hot and that makes people uncomfortable. \n\nThere's also the argument that video games cater to the male gaze. Have you seen Nightwings ass? Have you seen Tim Drake as Robin in Batman Arkham City? What about hide armour in Skyrim? There's plenty of eye candy for women in video games.

  "selftext": "I will use my own experience here.\n\nIn both school and college I was a nerd. I was obsessed with scoring high grades, and I often had the best grades of my class. I read a book and repeated that many many times until I got everything stuck in my memory. I crammed all that information into myself a few days before we had an exam. And it worked, I often scored a 10 out of 10. People were like \"you're so smart\" when in reality, I just put alot more time and effort into studying than my classmates did. Does that mean I'm super motivated and that is a good thing? Not really, because now that I'm a young adult, I realize alot of that studying was a waste of my time and energy. I don't even remember most of what I studied so hard years ago.\n\nReason 1: you can study something alot and score a perfect grade, but years later you might still completely forget it. If I have to redo all my college exams now, which I have passed, then I would fail most of them unless I study again\n\nReason 2: scoring perfect grades in college doesn't mean you're smart, and doesn't mean you understand the job/field you are preparing for. I have graduated from college with alot of high grades, and still at the moment of graduating, I had this \"how the fuck am I supposed to do this job\" question in my head. I was still clueless to how to do the job that I studied so hard for, for 3 years.\n\nSo, I have a history of high grades, yet it hasnt helped me at all.

  "title": "CMV: All restaurants should have public photos of all items they serve",
  "selftext": "I have always had ARFID, which is something I cope with by knowing what foods I can eat and planning around that in such a way that I get some variety. However, it means that most restaurant menus have only 1-3 items which I can actually eat. Usually, I play it safe by ordering the item which is least likely to be inedible to me. I have to steer clear of items which carry the risk of being prepared in such a way that they repulse me. But when I can see a dish, I know instantly whether I can eat it or not. Having that information would allow me to order a larger variety of dishes, and in turn enjoy restaurants more.\n\nBecause of Curb Cut effect, that policy I am advocating will be beneficial for many more people than just me. Generally speaking, it’s good to let people know what they’re getting before you give it to them. It will reduce customer complaints, “this isn’t what I expected.” It is beneficial for both parties, because you’re educating the customer about which option is right for them. If the customer wants to be surprised, that’s fine; they can ask the waiter to surprise them. But there is a reason photos on menus exist; I’m only advocating to expand that to all items.\n\nThe following is the most intuition-based and hard to express part of my argument. But I think photos just offer such extremely more information than text descriptions. It is possible it’s just a quirk of how my brain processes information, but given how extreme the difference is, it’s hard for me to believe that anyone actually gets more value from descriptions than pictures. Most descriptions are a list of ingredients or general food categories. This leaves out a lot. “How much of each ingredient are there? How are they cooked? How are they prepared? Ingredients come in different types and styles. It says it uses peppers. What is the exact size, color, frequency, and dispersion of the peppers?” \n\nIn menus more than anything, text is a limited (and inferior) mode of communication. For one, menus expect from their readers a vocabulary that is compatible both with cuisine generally, and the regional terminology of the restaurant’s theme (eg, a French restaurant using French food names). It’s almost like a form of gatekeeping. \n\nYou can say “sight and taste are unrelated”, but I don’t know what to tell you other than that’s totally untrue for me. I can tell a lot about taste and texture from the look. Next time you see a photo of a food item on a menu, compare whether you get more information from the ingredient description or the photo. Both should exist. But when the photo isn’t present, it forces me to visualize the item in my head as best I can from the limited description. \n\nIt shouldn’t be too difficult to create what I want. Just have someone in the restaurant causally spend a day or two taking photos of all the outgoing food items and compile the best photos. They don’t need to hire the types of people who shoot fast food commercials. If you can’t even take a good photo of your food, without expensive cameras, then you probably shouldn’t be selling it. You should have confidence in your dishes. \n\nThe argument that I’ve heard against this is that it would ruin the design of menus to have photos on them, that it would be tacky, or that menus simply don’t have enough physical space for photos of everything. I agree that it would compromise the length of menus. However, almost every restaurant (especially since the Covid era, as a silver lining of the QR codes to scan) now has a website. A website isn’t going to run out of space for photos. The online menu could have a “view image” item for each item, or something like that. Now, the physical paper menu does not need to have a single photo. I just want the photos available somewhere for those who really want it. \n\nI doubt that I will change my view, or stop wanting this. However, if someone presents me with some issues that I had not considered, that challenge some of my beliefs, I’m willing to grant deltas. Maybe there's a reason why this isn't more widespread.",

  "selftext": "When discussing the topic of equality in the US, I often hear record-high executive pay mentioned as one of the primary reasons why wages have remained stagnent while productivity has increased.\n\nTo look into this more, I decided to create a spreadsheet of 45 companies in the S&P 500 divided evenly among all major sectors. For each company I measured, it's total number of employees, total executive pay (by adding up the pay of the executives listed on Yahoo Finance), annual dividend payout, and annual share repurchase spending. Upon recording these numbers for each company, I created these three metrics which ended up having the following median values:\n\nAnnual executive pay per employee -> $227\n\nAnnual dividend payout per employee -> $39,606\n\nAnnual share repurchase spending per employee -> $29,093\n\nAs you can see, executive pay per employee equates to only about 3 days of minimum wage work per year, whereas the median dividend payout per employee is actually higher than the median annual salary in the US. That's not even to mention that the median share repurchase spending per employee is just shy of the median income in the US.\n\n(**Note**: In my findings most companies had a high dividend payout, and significantly lower spending on buybacks, or high spending on buybacks, and a significantly lower dividend payout. So, looking at the median for both could create the misperception that companies are spending a lot of money on both, when in reality most companies are paying mostly one or the other.)\n\nSeeing this clear disparity leads me to believe that the discussion around executive pay is pointing at the wrong thing. If workers want a stake in the profits of their company, the bulk of the money is clearly in dividends and share buybacks. I realize that rich executives flying in private jets as their company lays off workers isn't exactly a great look, but the numbers seem to imply that that isn't making a big difference. In my research, I found that executive pay was consistently measured in millions of dollars, whereas dividends and buybacks were usually measured in billions, and as the saying goes,\n\n\"The difference between a million dollars and a billion dollars is roughly a billion dollars\"",

But I feel no reason other than selfish ones to care about people more than animals. \n\nSome people will say we are smarter or more emotionally complex than animals, therefore we have moral value. However, I don't think that gives what we experience any more value than what an animal subjectively experiences. Dumb people have just as much fun as smart people, can live in the moment more at times, and love life just as much. If someone was incapable of feeling nostalgia, it would have very little impact on their life or any moral implication for them. Also, that would mean that more intelligent humans are more valuable than humans who are either unintelligent. \n\nAnother argument would be that because I happen to be a human, I must support and care about other humans. As a conscious entity, or \"soul\", I don't think there is anything different between \"me\" and the \"soul\" that experiences the world as an animal. By choosing to care more about humans, who do so much destruction to animals as a whole, I'm essentially punishing those beings because their consciousness, which is inherently no different from mine, happens to experience reality through the lens of an animal. \n\nAnd then there's the social contract of sorts: I would want other humans to care about me and help me if I were in need. I wouldn't want to be neglected or not cared about by other people. But we, as humans, by living, destroy nature and harm animals. The animals don't want their forests slashed down, their habitats polluted, their lives taken, even if this desire isn't actively felt.

In 2001, there's HAL 9000, an AI antagonist.\n* Human Survival: Survival is a central theme in both movies. \n* Silent Space Sequences: They include sequences with minimal dialogue, focusing on the visual and auditory experience of space.\n* Iconic Spacecraft: Discovery One in 2001 and the Endurance in Interstellar.\n* Being mislead/misinformed about the project: by HAL v/s the old scientist in interstellar. \n* Character Transformation: Key characters undergo significant transformations or transcendence, such as Dave Bowman's transformation in 2001 and Cooper's journey through the tesseract in Interstellar.\n* The ending: floating in front of Saturn in interstellar vs jupiter in 2001.",

My point is, at a fundamental level (neurons), the infrastructure is similar. In addition, some responses by ChatGPT would be indistinguishable of a human response.

If you say \"humans have a concept of reality/self/the world / consciousness.. \" , what does that exactly mean? How can we so easily dismiss AI on those grounds if we don't really have a consensus on defining concepts such as \"consciousness\"? How does consciousness manifest in the human brain, and how does it not in a sufficiently advanced AI?\n\nEdit 2: about my point that intelligence is badly defined, please see e.g., Chollet (2019):\n\n>Many formal and informal definitions of intelligence have been proposed over the pastfew decades, although there is no existing scientific consensus around any single definition.Sternberg & Detterman noted in 1986 \\[87\\] that when two dozen prominent psychologistswere asked to define intelligence, they all gave somewhat divergent answers.

When demand increases while supply does not, prices shoot up and many people get priced out of the market entirely.\n\nThere are left wing solutions, namely building a ton of public housing. But outlawing exclusionary zoning is not a left wing idea.\n\nFirst off, what is exclusionary zoning, anyway?\n\nFor roughly a century, the norm, at least in the US and Canada, has been to set aside vast swaths of land where the only things you can legally build are single-family houses. Want to build apartments? Too bad. How about a fourplex? Get lost.\n\nOutlawing exclusionary zoning is a type of deregulation, and deregulation is a classic right wing idea. Overregulation, conservatives argue, artificially restricts supply, which is cancer in a capitalist system. When you get rid of burdensome regulations, you unleash the power of the market to meet people's needs.\n\nIf you're a conservative and you want to preserve exclusionary zoning, you simply do not care about housing affordability or homelessness.

This shows it's a left wing idea, not a right wing idea.**\n\nThis just shows how absurdly right wing housing politics is. Lefties propose zoning reform as a compromise solution because they don't think they can muster enough political capital to use eminent domain to take over a bunch of land and build high-density public housing.\n\n**Conservatism isn't about improving people's lives. It's just about resisting change and oppressing poor people and minorities.**\n\nThis is toxic conservatism. People who believe this aren't conservatives. They're just assholes.\n\n**Banning exclusionary zoning is certainly *economically* right wing. But it's not socially right wing.**\n\nThe reason banning exclusionary zoning isn't a socially conservative idea is because it helps poor people and minorities more than it helps the rich.

Even conservative society mock virgin males and liberal society laugh on their problems. \nConservative do slut shaming of female but liberal are against it. \n PARADOX \nnote - liberal also mock female virgin \n\n7. Why my sexual freedom and choice is not respected ? \nIn this case, sexual freedom is not to do sex just because everyone doing .\n\n8.  Traditional people- wants to save virginity until married\nModern  people- fuk off virginity \n\nMy view - it's my right to choose . Both ideas simultaneously accepting each other belief \n\n9. Peace of mind -  Virgin realy just to live in peace. No hookup , no breakup, no heartbreak, no drug addiction, no mental trauma, \n\n10. Focus on goals - many famous people are so concentrated on their goals , they usually skip the lengthy process of fuking around.\n\n11. Procreation - doesn't goal of having sex to have kids historically.  Contraceptive are invented just a century ago .  Your ape brain want kids not waste of energy and sperm. \n\n12. If body count matters then every prostitute won gold medal.  Because you pay to have sex but they get money to have sex . Tell me who is boss here ? \n\n13. Leave virgin alone if you feel cheated ,abuse and torture by your partner and jealous that virgin faced none .\n\n14.  Sex is happiness?  You know who are happiest person ?  Kids . Literally, childhood of every person are the happiest moments of their life . There innocent behaviour is blessing to the world.\n\nConclusion - you go, your way and I go, my way . let's not demotivate and insult each other. \nThere is many path to happiness and everyone had the right to choose their way .\n \nEdit - 1.

  "title": "CMV: Furry haters are more cringe than furries",
  "selftext": "The furry community has some cringe, certainly.  But not as much as most people think, and it's nothing compared to the level of cringe that furry haters exhibit.\n\nFurries are furries for a variety of reasons.  For some it's just a fun thing they do comerable to engagement with a fandom, for others it's more of a strong identity such that they'd become their fursona IRL if given the chance, for some it's more of a sexual thing or a combination of factors.\n\nThere is this pervasive idea that being a furry is related in some way to zoophilia, but that's wrong.  One consistent thing among furries is that any sexualized creature is a sapient and usually humanoid person capable of consenting to sex and communicating it.  They aren't real animals, they are purely fictional creatures that are in every relevant way basically just different looking people.  Furry characters are usually functioning as a persona representing a real person, in fact.  A fursona, you might even say.  To make a comparison: calling furries zoophiles would be like calling somebody a pedophile because they have a kink for adults wearing diapers or are into ageplay.  Call it weird all you want, but they're ultimately sexualizing adults so there really isn't a problem here.\n\nBut furry haters on the other hand...  They are unbelievably cringe.  It's clear that they are trying to be edgy, but they aren't tactful enough to be edgy in a way that doesn't just involve being openly hateful towards people with no subtext or punchline, and they don't have the stones to do any bigotry that people would disagree with, so they go after furries.  It truly is some \"I'm 14 and this is edgy\" tier shit from people who want to be edgy because it would make them look cool but who are secretly conformists who openly mock the idea of thinking about the things they say.\n\nThe original meaning of being \"edgy\" is that you are willing to go up to the edge of what's socially acceptable, but doing that requires an awareness of where these social boundaries are and putting thought into what you do and say such that you come near to the edge without crossing it.  Around people who are part of marginalized groups being edgy can be more endearing than being hugboxy, because it demonstrates an awareness of the social boundaries and it shows thea consideration for the other person that you are so tactful in not to crossing them.  But being openly hateful isn't edgy, it's just lazily blasting right past the edge into the realm of unacceptability.  True edginess is an artform, and all these furry haters just shit all over it in a crude attempt to mimic its aesthetics.",

  "selftext": "So, given my limited understanding of geo-politics, and my somewhat decent understanding of the lead up to WWI, it just seems to me that since there was that drone attack attempt on the Kremlin that a drastic escalation between the US and Russia is very likely.\n\nIf the drone strike was a legit attempt to attack the Kremlin, than that means that Russia will retaliate hard and are now primed to do so. Against either Ukraine, or the USA who supports Ukraine by sending them weapons.\n\nOr it was a false flag, which Russia is going to use as an excuse for further retaliation. Which also means it is inevitable. Because if the Russian state has already gone through the effort to do this operation (and make it's own military defense systems look very incompetent in doing so), it means that Russia is committed to a drastic - ie. nuclear - response in Ukraine. \n\nSimply put, if Russia has the motive to fake this attack on their own government, it means they are primed to want to use these more drastic measures. \n\nThe only other option is someone other than Ukraine or the US is behind this, which I frankly don't see given the US and Ukraine are Russia's major global competitors.\n\nSo Russia is primed to want to nuke Ukraine now. And if they do that who the fuck knows how the USA is going to respond.\n\nWhy Russia would want to do something so insane is beyond me, and why anyone in the US or Ukraine would want to provoke Russia in such a way is also beyond me. No one could have possibly thought that launching a drone attack on Russia would do anything but further commit them to their current invasion.\n\nMaybe all our leaders are just fucking madmen, I don't know. But given it just seems like Ukraine is about to get nuked, which might very well prompt a nuclear response from the USA and it's allies, so we will likely be at full scale war with Russia soon.",

  "title": "CMV: It is safer for an individual to drive slightly faster than the traffic around them compared to the same speed or adhering strictly to the posted speed limit.",
  "selftext": "I once saw a graph which I have been able to locate again for years. I regret that I can't cite it here, but it has in part colored my view. I do believe there are negative consequences if my view is wrong, so I am very open to being corrected. That said, I've thought about it a lot, so this may not be an easy CMV.\n\nSince I can't cite the graph, I will describe it by memory. It was a comparison of incident rate as a function of the speed differential between the two vehicles. The graph was U shaped, but surprisingly, the trough of the U did not center on 0 speed differential. You'd think it would be difficult to have an incident when you are going the same speed as another vehicle, but in fact the lowest incident rate was something like +5 mph. My assumption is that when 2 vehicles are going the same speed next to each other, there's an increased risk of one merging into the other.\n\n\\[*Adding: after I typed this post, I was able to find similar but not exact graph to what I remember. See* [this document](https://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1529&context=all_theses)*, pages 12 and 14. I have not read the paper.\\]*\n\nMy takeaway from this was that, on an individual level (obviously this wouldn't work if you convinced everyone to do it), it is safer to drive marginally faster than most of the people around you. From memory, on the graph, anywhere between 0 and +10 MPH had a lower incident rate than 0 MPH.\n\nMy rationale deals with where your attention is focused when you are driving - on the road and obstacles in front of you. Yes, a good driver will routinely check mirrors, but even then, they aren't (and shouldn't be) spending nearly as much time looking behind as looking ahead. Further, mirrors are an imperfect view of what's behind, both because of the limited field of view and the possible distortion.\n\nBy driving faster than most people around you, you encounter more vehicles from the front than you do from the rear. Now I'm not talking about driving faster than *everybody*, or driving excessively fast, just driving a speed such that you seem to be gaining on people more often than being passed by people.\n\nThis should not change the way that you check your mirrors. I'm excluding the possibility of this influencing a driver to change their driving habits for the worse, focusing more on the front than they normally do.\n\nI'm also not talking about weaving in and out of traffic or tailgating. These are dangerous practices that obviously increase your chance of incident. I'm a staunch believer in passing on the left, and only going around on the right when there is plenty of opportunity.\n\nI'm assuming good road conditions. Slick or icy roads obviously call for slower absolute speed, as does heavy traffic.\n\nIf road conditions are favorable, such that you can easily position yourself away from all traffic, then that is preferable and you might as well maintain the speed limit if that allows you to maintain a bubble for yourself away from other traffic.\n\nTo summarize, my view is that it is safest for me to drive at a speed where I am passing the majority of the traffic at a moderate rate, roughly +5-10 MPH, so that most traffic I encounter is in front of me where my attention is focused.",

  "selftext": "Some people think that belonging to a culture that was colonized by someone in the past gives them moral supremacy over the people of the colonizer culture. For example, I have a friend from a Central Asian country which was part of Russian Empire. He thinks that\n\n1. Russians ethnicals or Russian speakers should not use traditional Russian spelling or pronunciation of toponyms in his country — they must spell them the way it's done in his native language.\n\n2. but at the same time he can use whatever spelling he likes for Russian toponyms. For example, he can say Maskeu (his native language) instead of Moskva (Russian).\n\nHe demands that Russian ethnicals should be more aware of what happened in the past, and insists that they are not feeling guilty enough for it. And his country has a significant percentage of Russian ethnicals who were born there and who, as people, didn't do anything to him. They are citizens of that country same as him, and they deserve the right to keep their language and their culture without having to apologize to anyone.\n\nI think his stance is hypocritical and absolutely unjustified. This is his own xenophobia and self-servingly picked ethical principles, which normally would not be tolerated in a civilized society, but now with woke agenda he is somehow allowed to be publicly display this attitude and be called a progressive instead of douchebag.\n\nI gave my friend as a concrete example, but I think that this type of attitude is common, especially in the West. It also applies to some of the Ukrainians who are being very hateful towards Russian culture because of the war.\n\nTo summarize, my two problems with this stance are:\n\n1. The moral principles it's based on are hand-picked to serve (presumably) oppressed people's sense of self-pity, not limited by anything. Unless restrained by self-control or some reasonable public criticism, a person will come to the conclusion that they're the most wronged one in the world and everyone owes them something (like Putin does when he explains why he invaded Ukraine). And this progressive anti-colonialist agenda is reinforcing this effect.\n\n2. I don't think there's any point in blaming empires of 17-19 centuries for colonizing other countries and trying to multiply their power (although it's ok to blame them for some concrete atrocities and genocide that may not have been necessary). Anyone who didn't do that back then got subdued by others — we didn't have the economical and political situation of nowadays that prevents that. And blaming Russia for colonizing Central Asia is like blaming it for choosing (and being able) not to be colonized by others, and not ending up whining now about anti-colonialism like my friend does.\n\n   Also, those colonized countries weren't harmless either. Central Asian nomads raided and fought Russians way before Russia became an empire. Mongol invasion came from them. I don't see any point in this search for historical justice. It's inconsistent, it's cherry-picking facts in a self-serving manner. Russia was subdued and nearly colonized by other countries before it became empire.\n\nI do allow though the colonized cultures to feel traumatized about the past and to ask (nicely) the other to be compassionate and understanding. And I believe that any decent person should give them that (as long as they're doing the same). But it is a favor, not an obligation.",

I am aware of this, and this is the point that is being made in Fat Head. My argument is that most people, when they eat at McDonalds, are going to eat until they feel full and as a result their calories in will be greater than their calories out.\n\nSo this is a response to the documentary Fat Head, which is itself a response to the documentary Super Size Me.\n\nIn Super Size Me a healthy adult man eats nothing but McDonalds for one month and gains a bunch of weight, and his blood tests etc. come back worse than before he started the McDonalds diet. It's intended as a demonstration of the dangers of a fast food diet, and by extension a significant portion of the American diet.\n\nIn Fat Head a man tries to debunk Super Size Me by losing weight while eating nothing but McDonalds. He does this with small portion sizes e.g. just eating a cheeseburger for a whole meal.\n\nI would argue that this doesn't address the danger of an average fast-food-heavy diet, because the average person wouldn't just order one cheeseburger when they go to McDonalds. They'll get a combo, at the very least - personally even that isn't enough to fill me up, when I go to McDonalds I'll get a combo, some extra sides, and an extra burger or two! And I'm only 80kg, a lot of McDonalds regulars are bigger than me and need to eat a lot more to feel full.\n\nSo I would argue that most people would gain weight if they ate nothing but McDonalds, and the Fat Head documentary doesn't address the true danger of eating too much fast food, because most people aren't eating tiny portions when they get fast food.",

  "title": "CMV: Training AI is not stealing art",
  "selftext": "The main argument for `AI = theft` stance is the claim that it “uses” artists work without their permission for training. This is a very specific phrasing designed to make the training process sound more unethical than it actually is. “Use” is a very very vague word. Usage of artworks can range from admiring, to studying, to copying, to using as jerk off material. \n\nNot every usage of existing work is infringement, and not every use case requires the consent from the artist. \n\nAnd here is why training an AI model is not stealing.\n\n**1. Generating copyrighted work is theft**\nTo get this out of the way, if you generate something that is [substantially similar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantial_similarity) to a copyrighted work, it is theft and infringement; there’s no doubt on that. If you generate and publish art of mickey mouse, you should face the legal consequences, the same ways as anyone producing it with photoshop or pencils. The theft in this case is committed by the user, but nothing to do with how the AI was trained. \n\n**2. Training does not generate artwork**\nTraining and image generation are two very separate processes. The training dataset is **only used** during training. The only output of the training process is the model that is capable of generating images. The model does not have any access to the training data during generation. This is why people say training is like learning, because it merely gives the model the ability to generate images. A human can also study a bunch of pictures of mickey mouse, and learn to draw mickey mouse. Having the ability to draw mickey mouse is not theft **until they actually draw it.** This is exactly what training is “using” the dataset for - learning. If someone chose to use the model to generate copyrighted material, then it’s back to point 1.\n\n**3. Should artists be compensated for contributing the training data?**\nOf course not. This is a very unreasonable expectation and here is why. First, imagine you’re a human artist trying to draw a modern house. Human artists “draw inspiration” from real life, that is hundreds of houses and buildings they’re seen throughout their lives, and maybe hundreds of designs in other artworks. Either way, all of these houses are designed by an architect or a designer. Whether you like to admit or not, every building you see subconsciously contributes to the model house you draw. Should you pay every architect as well? **Again, of course not.** Why is that so? Because the contribution of individual building is negligible, like 1 in 1000 (0.1%). Your new design will contain many common elements with many of the modern houses out there, but it is still different from an individual building. You did most of the work by taking hundreds of minute elements and combine, aggregate and modify them into something new. This is the same with AI, except the individual contribution of each image is much much smaller. (One image out of 5.5billion is 0.00000018%.) So as long as it is justifiable for an artist to not pay the architects, it makes no sense for AI researchers to compensate the artists.\n\nIn summary, as long as you are not using the model to generating something similar to existing work, there is no art theft. Stealing is done by bad actors generating copyrighted images, nothing to do with how the model is trained.",

I feel like none of these pose a credible threat to the existence of humans. Don't get me wrong, some of them can absolutely cause significant damage to humankind, but not extinction-level.\n\nFor AI to cause an extinction level event, it requires a. the AI to be able to operate completely independently from humans, b. have the motivation to eliminate humans, and c. humans to surrender all autonomy to the AI. I just don't see how our survival instinct and forewarnings via sci-fis will allow any of these to take place.\n\nFor nuclear or biological warfare to eliminate humankind, it requires one party to be willing to eliminate oneself, the enemy and all third parties. Unless some kind of social collapse happens, I don't see a world where a country would be willing to do that, or even risk that. Don't get me wrong, a nuclear war will kill a lot of people, but to kill all humans requires a country to make that move intentionally.\n\nAsteroids of the kind that kill the dinosaurs happen once every tens of millions of years, and we'd spot them very easily. I don't think it's a credible threat at all. \n\nClimate change, on the other hand, can lead to runaway climate change, or destruction of our food or water supply, or change the atmospheric composition so it's no longer habitable for humans, and so on. At the end of the day, humans are dependent on nature and if nature changes drastically enough humankind can collapse. Can climate change lead to a depletion of resources that then leads to nuclear warfare? Yeah, but the root cause of that extinction is still man-made climate change.",

In America, a current recession means that people aren’t able to buy cars they could have before the recession.\n\nAll this is compounded with the increasingly popular belief that fossil fuel cars are horrible for the environment and electric cars are better even if there is some potential evidence to the contrary. The Top Gear Trio, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond are wrapping up the Grand Tour, who could be partially responsible for creating a new generation of traditional sports car enthusiasts.\n\nBattery and charging technology are improving and once it is quick to charge an electric car in numerous charging stations that can drive for 500 miles on a single charge that also happens to be affordable, that may be the death knell for combustion engines.",

  "title": "CMV: The BBC should have mentioned Zara Jade's current victim's gender as much as Jade's",
  "selftext": "The BBC article currently titled [Zara Jade jailed after stabbing and tying up victim in Halifax](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-leeds-65097013) repeatedly mentions Jade's gender, using \"woman\", \"she\" (11 times), and \"her\" (4 times). At the time (approximately 25 April) that the twitter account @ESCdiscord took a [screenshot](https://twitter.com/ESCdiscord/status/1650787662125580288/photo/1) of Ian Banham's reply tweet, the BBC had used as a title for previewing \"Woman jailed after stabbing and tying up victim\", making the perpetrator's gender the entirety of the perpetrator's identity for that headline. When tweeted (approximately 28 March), there was a tweet summary of [Zara Jade: Halifax woman jailed after stabbing and tying up victim](https://twitter.com/BBCLookNorth/status/1640625011168870401).\n\nBy contrast, the BBC only mentioned the victim's gender twice: in the sentence \"Zara Jade, 54, attacked her victim at a Halifax flat last year and left her tied up while she went to an ATM\" and in the phrase \"also demanded her PIN number\". It's almost the bare minimum the BBC could do, and you could easily miss it. Meanwhile the article repeatedly used gender-neutral terms for her: in the headline itself, \"attacked her victim\", \"from the victim\", \"tie her victim\", \"the victim's wounds\", \"Jade's victim had serious health issues\", and \"towards a vulnerable victim\".\n\nWhile the perpetrator's gender is newsworthy, in that the perpetrator is going to a male prison, so is the victim's gender. While violence is bad in general, violence against women (especially vulnerable ones) is especially abhorrent. And yes, that includes violence against a victim who's reported elsewhere as being transgender. It also indicates more attention is being given to the perpetrator of violence than its victim.\n\nI can only speculate why the BBC did this - maybe it wanted to ragebait people, but that's harmful as well, even if it's seemingly transgender friendly.\n\nChange my view.",

  "selftext": "For a damn long time, i have seen tiktoks, reels, ytb shorts and whatnots talking about how \"GenZ will be the best parents in history\". At first I thought that is quite accurate since I'm also a GenZ and something praising me feels good obviously. However, as I observe my peers and watch more contents, i realize that this generation could possibly be one of the worst parents.\nFor starter, most of us are dumb as shit, doing life-threatening trends or challenges for a 15 second video on a daily basis to beg for popularity. These people whom supposedly \"the best parents\" consume tide pods and call it a day.  Furthermore, intrinsic moral values are decomposing everyday, a prime example is loyalty. Why the f... is the standard so f...ing low, that loyalty is worshipped as a virtuous quality instead of the norm along with various other qualities that a half decent person should already have. \nSure, GenZ might be more conscious about mental health and care about the children well-being more than the previous generations, but their unbalanced attitude to nurturing kids is as harmful as it is of the former generations. Enrolling your kids in an abundance of social classes can be as stressful as attending academic classes. In addition, the \"chill\" type of way to treat your kid is a double bladed knife and I doubt anyone of them would think of it. Leaving the child to a computer or exposing them to it too early on is undoubtedly the worst way to kill a child's brain. Our parents may be obnoxious and annoying and unrespecting of our privacy, yet any adults here can name a thing or two that they are grateful for being scolded by their parents even though at that time, they didn't understand it.

  "title": "CMV: Modern China is a fascist state and proves that classical (Italian) fascism can work better on a large scale than Communism.",
  "selftext": "Some time ago a friend asked me if I was ‘against literal Fascism’ more as a joke than as an actual question. The term is always thrown around by Socialists to insult everyone who isn’t a socialist, and by liberals to insult far-right extremists and Socialists, and basically everyone always claims not to be a fascist when accused, so it must be bad. Of course my answer was immediately yes, but then he asked me why, and I honestly couldn’t come up with an immediate answer. So I started to research what fascism was, and I realized that it was different than I had thought. Classical Italian fascism (not national socialism!) has the following defining characteristics:\n\n\\-\tThe idea that the individual is less important than the nation (or group) as a whole, essentially anti-individualism and very collectivist. From this assumption follow many other fascist principles, for instance, that the suppression of the Intelligentsia is justified because it is necessary for the nation to flourish, that war isn’t necessarily bad if it serves the interests of the nation, for whilst individuals may die, the group as a whole will become stronger, the principle that it’s okay to take away certain personal liberties from certain individuals, etc.\n\n\\-\tPaligenetic nationalism: extreme nationalism, which in fascism is often combined with the idea that the nation was once great, fell, but can made great again through nationalism and other means.\n\n\\-\tCorporativism, a fascist economic model which can best be described as a mostly capitalist one, but where the state has sufficient power to intervene in the economy when it deems it necessary for the people (or itself), and also controls certain parts of the economy which have been nationalized. Usually 10% or 20% of the economy is state-controlled, where the rest of the economy is capitalist, otherwise known as state capitalism.\n\n\\-\tTraditional and conservative social values.\n\n\\-\tAn authoritarian government which controls the media and curbs individual liberties such as freedom of speech (which is critical of the state) for the good of the nation.\n\nAnd China, despite claiming to be Communist, has ALL of these values. The economic mixed market (corporativism), the conservative social values, the idea that the group is more important than the individual, the nationalism, an authoritarian government. And it certainly does not have the main defining characteristic of Socialism: A mostly state-controlled (nationalized) economy, and the destruction of the ‘evil’ bourgeoisie; in fact, China has MULTIPLE billionaires.\n\nAnd one of the main fascist theorists (who are alive today), Ken Griffith, agrees with me that China is no longer Communist, and has been becoming increasingly fascist for a long time.\n\nThis brings me to my final point: Classical Italian Fascism works better than Maoism, a form of Communism, and also just communism in general. Communism wants to transition from a society with money to classless, stateless society. This will be achieved through simultaneously making the economy grow to the point where there is such an overflow of wealth and goods that the transition is possible, and by creating communes, small village-like communities which will be able to make the transition when the time comes. (I know this is a little bit Oversimplified but I have a migraine at this point so I’m just trying to get through the rest of this post quickly)\n\nOne such an attempt, mainly for economic growth, was the great leap forward, a social and economic programme conceived by ‘chairman’ Mao, to undergo a century of economic progress in 5 years or less. This project was mismanaged so terribly that 40-50 million Chinese died in a few years through grain deficits. The great leap forward was (and is) extremely complex, but the upshot is that Mao was replaced, tens of millions of Chinese people died, and there was some, but not sufficient to justify the cost in human lives, economic growth. Eventually, Mao came back in a ‘revolution within a revolution’ in which 20 million more Chinese died.\n\nSo, Communism in China killed tens of millions and achieved little economic growth. Then, after this terrible failure and Mao’s eventual death, China transitioned slowly, very slowly, to a more fascist state. Many of the Fascist principles were already there, such as an authoritarian government and collectivist ethos, but over time it gained the rest of the defining features, mainly the corporativist economic system.\n\nEver since it has been more Fascist than Communist, China has had massive economic growth, having an average rate of 10% economic growth per year between 1990 and 2004. Its fascist economic system allowed it to completely recover from the 2008 market crash through public spending, unlike the US, and it has the second largest army and one of the biggest navies in the the world. There are bad things too, of course, like the mistreatment of Uyghur people, but that is (IMO) way better than the  (at least) 40 million who died in the cultural revolution. Note: I am talking about classical Fascism, NOT National Socialism, which I do indeed believe to be worse than Communism.\n\nTL;DR: Current China is far more fascist than Communists, and its history has proven to me that classical Italian Fascism works better than Maoism. Change my view.\n\nEdit: A lot of people seem to think that I'm saying that Fascism isn't morally awfull. It is, **but so is Communism, the only difference being that normal (so not Nazi) Fascism actually has a remotely working economic sysytem.** I am not a Fascist *at all*, but I think it is economically better. To clarify I see it this way:\n\n**Every other Ideology > ((normal) Fascism > Communism > Nazism.**\n\nMy argument is thus economic in nature.",

  "title": "CMV: There are some fairly solid arguments in favour of letting trans women use women's spaces, but most also imply that there should be no gender or sex -split spaces at all/that men should be allowed into such spaces too",
  "selftext": "First off, this is gonna be a long one, so apologies in advance.\r  \n\r  \nSo I have seen a number of arguments frequently put forward when the debate of trans women being present in women’s-only spaces such as bathrooms, locker rooms, refuge centres or prisons, arguing that they should indeed be welcome in these spaces. Some are more based on practicality, others more on certain moral claims, but I think the main arguments I have seen do have some merits and are often pretty consistent with other attitudes we have towards inclusion versus exclusion.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, what I do find a little strange is that many of the same arguments could also be used similarly effectively to argue that the existence of single-sex or single-gender spaces at all is wrong, and that everyone – male or female, cis or trans, etc. – should be equally free to use whichever spaces they like. Segregation by gender or sex is a rare case of segregation that has remained largely uncontroversial until the recent past, but with the debate having now been re-opened, I think it’s hard to consistently argue in favour of maintaining any such form of segregation whilst arguing that excluding trans women from women’s spaces specifically is wrong. I will go through the most common arguments that I’ve seen in favour of letting trans women use women’s-only spaces, and explain why I feel each one could also plausibly be used to argue against the existence of women’s-only spaces at all, or spaces from which anyone of any sex or gender identity can be excluded.\r  \n\r  \n(It should of course be noted that vice versa also applies; I also feel that these arguments make the case that cis men or men in general should not be able to maintain spaces just for them that exclude trans men or any women. I have merely chosen to focus on the cases of trans women in women’s spaces and the existence of women’s spaces in general, as I’m by and large responding to a debate that’s already happening, and the opposite tends to generate much less controversy and heated argument.)\r  \n\r  \n**Impracticality and invasiveness of excluding people**\r  \n\r  \nOne common argument that I’ve seen is that attempting to prevent trans women from using women’s-only spaces would either be highly impractical and/or necessitate an extreme and embarrassing invasion of people’s privacy. In some cases, it does indeed seem implausible to think that, for example, every women’s bathroom or changing room could feature some kind of ID check to prove that all entrants were born female to prevent trans women from entering, plus we may simply see many people using some kind of fake ID, or many people may be so uninterested in enforcing the checks as to make them entirely unsuccessful. On the other hand, attempting to directly ‘verify’ someone’s sex such as by inspecting their genitalia would be an extremely invasive and humiliating ordeal to put someone through, one we could hardly countenance, particularly as given the very cis women the measure was allegedly to protect would have to face the same checks too.\r  \n\r  \nThis to me seems like a pretty strong line of argument. I can imagine at least some settings in which someone’s sex could be verified both practically and without the need for anything all that invasive – if they were signing up for a sports league, for example, it probably wouldn’t be that hard to ask for a birth certificate or a letter from a GP confirming what sex the person was assigned at birth – but for very mundane stuff like bathrooms, it does indeed seem pretty hard to enforce. However, I think most of the above points would also hold true for a man who wanted to similarly access a space reserved only for cis or trans women. Checking the ID of every somewhat masculine-looking person at the door of every bathroom or changing room would be similarly impractical and inspecting their bodies similarly invasive, and would also run the same risk of harming some of the very people the measure was apparently to protect. At this stage, unerringly enforcing any kind of gender or sex segregation of these spaces seems impossible, and thus, maintaining women’s-only spaces at all does present a bit of a practical headache and the sacrificing of some people’s dignity to ensure that the current users of those spaces feel safe. If that trade-off is unjust when it comes to trans women, it’s surely unjust when it comes to men too.\r  \n\r  \n**Wrongness of collective punishment**\r  \n\r  \nAnother common argument I’ve seen is that the exclusion of trans women from women’s-only spaces on the grounds of fears for cis women’s safety amounts to a kind of collective punishment. There have indeed been a few cases of trans women (or at least, people claiming to be trans women) assaulting women in these spaces, but the vast majority of trans women have not done so and it would seem fair to assume will not do so at any point in the future. It is thus unreasonable and prejudicial to set out a blanket ban on a whole group of people availing of certain spaces simply because some people from that group have used it as a route to committing crimes; it would be as wrong as something like forbidding all Muslims from using public transport because a handful of Islamic extremists have committed terror attacks.\r  \n\r  \nThis again is I think a promising enough line of argument and pretty consistent with our wider values. We do tend to treat people as individuals and to regard the stereotyping of whole groups or the indelible association of certain bad character traits or crimes with whole groups as irrational and harmful. And we hold to principles of ‘innocent until proven guilty’, so it seems unreasonable to restrict someone’s activities over a potential crime they may commit when to date they have done nothing wrong. Again, though, I think we would be obliged to extend the same benefit of the doubt to men as well. Many women have been victim of crimes by men, but this does not by the above principles seem good enough reason to debar every individual man from entering into certain spaces, or to argue that assault is something indelibly masculine, or to categorise every man as a potential assaulter any more so than anybody else. This is I think a controversial subject because at this point in time having these feelings about men does seem to be more socially acceptable: arguing that not all men are abusers is often interpreted as an insensitive dismissal of the fears of those who may be abused by men, and women being wary of men in general is not seen as a prejudicial thing. To an extent, I think the same is also true in today’s climate of attitudes to trans women: I’ve seen many news outlets covering accounts from cis women of feeling ‘unsafe’ around trans women in a fairly sympathetic light, whilst I’m sure the same outlets would not dream of giving the time of day to something like a white person saying they felt unsafe around black people, or a Christian saying they felt unsafe around Muslims; they and most other people would firmly regard that as an irrational prejudice on that person’s part and certainly not a reason for us to treat those other people any differently to accommodate for that person’s anxieties.\r  \n\r  \nIn sum, then, I think there is good reason to argue for giving trans women as a group the benefit of the doubt and presuming that any trans woman wishing to use a women’s-only space is not there with any nefarious intent, and in not making concessions to those who object simply because they feel unsafe; it’s consistent with our attitudes to other groups, be they racial, religious, etc. But likewise by that reasoning it would be wrong to assume that any man intermingling with women is doing so as an opportunistic predator, or that that man should be expected to leave if some object to him being there.\r  \n\r  \n**Physical danger, or lack thereof**\r  \n\r  \nThirdly, a common argument I’ve seen as a rebuttal to those concerned about trans women in women’s spaces – as well as in settings like women’s sports – is that any concerns some may have about trans women possessing greater physical strength also amount to a crude generalisation. Males and females come in all shapes and sizes, and so even if the average person assigned male at birth is indeed taller and more likely to develop greater muscle mass than the average person assigned female at birth, that certainly does not mean that all trans women are going to be able to easily overpower all cis women, and so does not justify general concerns of cis women being physically disadvantaged against trans women, and any accompanying concerns that may go with that territory.\r  \n\r  \nThis is another tricky one, because the general differential in height and strength between men and women is often cited as justification for why women being wary of men has a more rational and less prejudicial basis than, say, a person of one race being wary of people of other races. It’s not just that a woman is more likely to be assaulted by a man than by another woman, but that a male attacker would typically present a greater threat and thus that being wary of men in general to an extent makes sense. If this is a rational basis for ensuring that women in general have certain spaces from which men can be excluded, isn’t it also rational for cis women to have spaces that exclude trans women too?\r  \n\r  \nThe counterpoint, as I’ve said, is the fact that this is a generalisation. There are plenty of trans women out there of small and light physiques who would not present all that different a physical threat from a cis woman, and so excluding the whole group or feeling wariness towards the whole group may be unjust and another case of ‘collective punishment’. But the same again holds true of men. Some men are also physically unimposing, and wariness of these men and subsequent debarring of them from certain spaces simply because of threats posed by other, different men would seem equally wrong.\r  \n\r  \nThe final point I have to mention here and admit my ignorance on is that I don’t know to just what extent transitioning diminishes these physical differences. I imagine it cannot eliminate them entirely, but it may be that trans women are on average stronger than cis women but not as strong on average as cis men. In which case, one may seek to argue that there is a cut-off point of just how much stronger on average a group must be before another group can reasonably exclude them on safety grounds, and that cis men are above this cut-off point but trans women are not. This would seem defensible enough, much in the same way that if you ran a kennels business it might be reasonable to put the Labradors in with the terriers, but not the Rottweilers in with the terriers. This isn’t a line of argument I’ve seen too many people embark upon, but if it was demonstrably true it might be a pretty robust defence.\r  \n\r  \n**Segregation as a fundamental wrong**\r  \n\r  \nArgument number four that I’ve seen, related again to that collective punishment notion, is that segregation of different groups of people into separate spaces is just fundamentally wrong as a concept. Some might argue that it is wrong because it is done on arbitrary grounds, whilst others may argue that it is wrong because it is likely to precipitate other harms like a two-tier society, or because it leads to the ‘othering’ of certain groups and the deeper entrenchment of social divides.\r  \n\r  \nIt’s not shocking that many people apparently feel this way and often make appeals to such ideas, because many forms of segregation in practice have indeed proven to be all of those things just described. Also because often promises that segregation can be done justly or that it does not imply inequality, such as the infamous ‘separate but equal’ defence of racial segregation in some American states, have proven to be mere bluster to conceal the mistreatment of certain groups.\r  \n\r  \nIn practice, though, whilst the segregation of some spaces and activities by gender or sex down the years has also been abolished (particularly former male-only zones that have since become unisex), segregation of certain spaces and activities by gender or sex such as bathrooms or changing rooms is one that for a long time held up with little controversy, and which I think fundamentally still holds up with little controversy today. There is an ongoing argument of whether it should be sex or gender that separates these places, but very few people are arguing that they shouldn’t be separated at all. It cannot of course be ignored that unlike some previous segregations such as the Jim Crow laws, segregation of bathrooms and such is at least even-handed: men and women each have their own exclusive spaces and the spaces are generally of comparable quality, as opposed to those states where the best of all public services were reserved for white people and black people were forced to make do with the poor quality public services that were left. But an underlying part of it is I think simply that a lot of people simply still regard segregation by gender or sex as a general feature of life as reasonable, in a way that they don’t with other characteristics. People are, rightly or wrongly, comfortable with men’s and women’s bathrooms in a way that they would not be comfortable with black and white bathrooms, regardless of how equal the two were in exclusivity and quality.\r  \n\r  \nThis, I think, is one of the major sources of strife when it comes to debates like the trans bathroom debate and one of the major reasons why the two sides struggle to see eye-to-eye. There are, of course, some who simply do not view trans women as women. But I think there are others who do indeed view trans women as women, but nevertheless view segregating bathrooms or locker rooms or other spaces by cis versus trans as reasonable, and find “but we are all women” as non-compelling an argument against this as they would find “but we are all human” to be a lacklustre argument against segregating bathrooms by men versus women. The other side of the aisle comes with the view that segregating bathrooms, locker rooms etc. by cis versus trans is as inherently wrong as segregating them by race; that it’s othering, that it’s treating people differently for arbitrary reasons. But I cannot see how this could not also be followed by the conclusion that segregated bathrooms full stop are inherently wrong; that it encourages men and women to ‘other’ one another and puts an arbitrary line between them. Having gendered spaces at all, then, I think undermines any argument in favour of trans women’s access to women’s spaces that rests solely on the idea that segregation is a fundamental wrong that cannot be permitted under any circumstances.\r  \n\r  \n**'If it bothers you so much, go somewhere else'**\r  \n\r  \nThe final argument I’ve seen in favour of trans women in women’s-only spaces is simply that any cis woman who does not feel comfortable with the arrangement should simply go elsewhere. It’s a familiar argument across many situations where some people take umbrage with others: that the obligation is on the people who take umbrage to make way, not the other way around.\r  \n\r  \nThis is in my view the weakest of all the arguments addressed here, and I find it equally weak in other circumstances too. That is not me saying that I think every person’s every preference should be accommodated, or that we are obliged to meet their every demand in order for them to not feel offended. Rather, I’m saying that the burden of responsibility does not *always* fall on the offended party to either grin and bear it or leave. Some things, people can be reasonably expected to put up with or to take themselves away if it bothers them; other times, that is not a reasonable expectation.\r  \n\r  \nThis also applies to the single-gender or single-sex spaces row. The crux of supporting letting trans women use women’s-only spaces is that cis women do not have good reason to be bothered by this occurrence; that this is a case where we rightly can expect them to either put up with it or go somewhere else, because it is little or no imposition on them to share the space with a trans woman. (Indeed, I’ve seen posts of the sticker stuck on bathroom walls with a catchphrase along the lines of “a trans woman peed here, and nothing happened to you” essentially making this argument: that trans women using women’s-only spaces has no inherent effect of any note on cis women.)\r  \n\r  \nBut the same argument can surely also be made that men and women sharing those spaces together also has no tangible impact on anybody’s life, and thus that nobody has any good reason to be bothered by that occurrence either. (Certainly, a woman entering into a bathroom to discover a sticker noting that a man was there several hours earlier would have no discernible impact.) If the argument is simply that one person’s desire to use the space trumps other people’s misgivings about it, then the burden to not use the space would be on the woman who felt uncomfortable rather than on the man who had previously not been allowed to go there. If “if you don’t like it, go somewhere else” holds as a general rule for cis women who don’t want to share a space with trans women, it presumably would hold for any women who didn’t want to share a space with any men, too.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nWhew, that was a long one. Anyway, to summarise/back to the title: there are numerous arguments in favour of trans women accessing women’s-only spaces – in terms of practicality, in terms of our other moral values, in terms of not punishing whole groups or suspecting bad intent from people who as of yet have done nothing wrong – but that they also imply that the existence of women’s-only spaces at all is not really defensible either, and that this may be a pill we have to swallow now that we are looking at the separation of our public spaces with renewed scrutiny.\r  \n\r  \nCMV",

  "title": "CMV: Eating vegan foods leads to less suffering for sentient beings than eating animal products",
  "selftext": "I believe that eating a vegan diet is the correct ethical choice for most people because it leads to less suffering for sentient beings.\n\nThere are a million different arguments for and against veganism out there, but I want to discuss the *specific* point above.  While many people disagree with the utilitarian framing I'm using, or believe moral consideration doesn't extend to animals, for the sake of this discussion let's assume that we want to reduce suffering for sentient beings (humans and animals) as much as possible.\n\nSome people argue that the benefits of eating animal products for humans (pleasure, comfort/ease, health) outweigh the suffering of the animals involved.  First, I will acknowledge that being vegan is not feasible for everyone based on certain monetary, situational, or health reasons.  That's fine, but for most non-impoverished people in developed countries, eating vegan (at least most of the time) is feasible and not unreasonably difficult.\n\nI do acknowledge the downsides of being vegan though--missing out on some delicious foods, less convenience, more work needed to ensure a balanced diet, and social pressures.  Still, it's not *that* hard.  My life is mostly the same as when I was eating meat.  I do think eating animal products would make me a little happier for the reasons I mentioned earlier, but this is not nearly enough justification to me.  I wouldn't want a dog or cat to go through significant physical pain or be killed just so I could be \"a little\" happier.  In general, I don't find this line of counterargument convincing, but I am open to it if you can convince me that going vegan causes significant harm to humans.\n\nI am more interested in arguments about the effects on animals.  Some argue that going vegan is pointless because the production of crops still harms animals: it disrupts the ecosystem, and we need to kill and keep out pests like rats.  I acknowledge this point, and I don't think eating vegan is truly \"cruelty-free.\"  However, I don't see how it could possibly cause MORE suffering than eating animal products.  For one, animal suffering is inherent to meat production, but only a byproduct (that can ideally be avoided as much as possible) of crop production.  Also, most sources I've seen say that most of the crops we produce are fed to livestock, so by eating vegan you are reducing the negative impacts of crop production as well.\n\nHowever, I'm no agriculture expert, so if anyone has good counterarguments or resources that quantify the argument above and make a compelling case that eating vegan does not actually lead to less suffering, I'm all ears.",

  "selftext": " If he was actually serious he wouldn't have given them such a long time to respond. He would've sent letters out the same day that the loans are forgiven, which would've allowed borrowers to countersue even if the courts struck it down, because borrowers would've already received notices the balance was forgiven. \n\nEven if not, Biden could just set REPAYE payments to 0% of disposable income, and the amount of payments needed for forgiveness to 5 payments or something. Overall Biden seems to once again be paying lip service, while doing the absolute least he possibly can. Frankly, even $20K is very little when my grandparents could get a better job with a HS diploma than I can get with a CS degree.\n\nEven beyond that, his changes to the \"hardship\" factor in Student loan bankruptcy cases is rather lackluster. If he was actually serious he could just direct the DOE to automatically assume that all applications qualify under \"hardship\".\n\n I also find it interesting the R's waited until the day after the election to file the lawsuit, it almost seems like a coordinated deal. \n\nOverall Biden seems completely disingenuous to say the least, and more likely just wants to say \"welp, at least I tried guys\".",

I do get that we're in very sensitive, unprecedented territory with his many indictments and lawsuits, but unprecedented behavior should result in unprecedented consequences, shouldn't they? Furthermore, isn't Donald Trump ultimately the architect of all of this by choosing to proceed with his candidacy, knowing that he was under investigation and subject to potential lawsuits and indictments? If a President commits a crime on his last day in office (or the day after) and immediately declares his candidacy for the next election, should we lose our ability to hold that candidate accountable? What if that candidate is a perennial candidate like Lyndon Larouche was? Do we just never have an opportunity to hold that candidate accountable?

  "selftext": "Do you ever see those articles or videos of people complaining about \"wokeness\" in media, but they never quite describe what that is? Based on the context, it sounds like they're just complaining about diversity. I think more diversity is a good thing, because the world is diverse. That's just reality.\r  \n\r  \nI love the show Friends, but I'm going to pick on it a bit just as an example. It takes place in New York, and all the main characters are straight white people. Almost all the supporting characters are white people. It isn't very realistic in its portrayal of New York, because the city in reality is not 99% white people.\r  \n\r  \nMy point is-- having more diversity makes sense and is more of a good thing than a bad thing. It's a net positive.\r  \n\r  \nNow let's look at some of the arguments these people make:\r  \n\r  \n**\"Executives are forcing diversity just to pander.\"**\r  \n\r  \nProbably. But executives have always pandered. Their job is to appeal to people in order to maximize profit. Why zero in on diversity as the main cause of this? It's a broader issue of studios chasing the dollar. At least in this case, the result of having more diversity isn't really a bad thing.\r  \n\r  \n**\"They sacrifice good writing for diversity.\"**\r  \n\r  \nOnce again, these are two separate things. I agree that telling a good story should be the focus. Why would diversity have anything to do with this? Why pick out diversity as the thing that is making movies forget to tell a good story? There have always been poorly written movies long before diversity was encouraged.\r  \n\r  \n**\"They make unnecessary changes to things we love.\"**\r  \n\r  \nAnytime something is brought back for a reboot or new adaptation, there are going to be changes. Not all of these changes will be strictly \"necessary\". As long as you don't have an attitude of being resistant to all change, I don't see why changing something just to be more diverse is a bad thing. Why not instead just blame the changes that actually harm the story and characters? A minor change like a character having a different skin color does not sound harmful to me. It sounds like a very minor change.\r  \n\r  \n**Conclusion**\r  \n\r  \nTo bring it all together, let's suppose they rebooted Friends with entirely new actors playing the same characters. And none of the acting was good. And they changed the race of one of the the main characters. And the writing was terrible. What would you think of all this? What would you mention in a critical review of it?\r  \n\r  \nI would think rebooting it in the first place is a completely unnecessary cash grab. I would be irritated by how bad the writing is. And I would point out how the new portrayals are not nearly as good as the original cast. So I'd have a lot of criticisms of the reboot, but none of this has anything to do with diversity or being \"woke\". If they decided to make Rachel black, I wouldn't care that the character was black. I would care that the new actor doesn't do as good of a job as Jennifer Aniston.\r  \n\r  \nAm I missing something? Where does this anger towards diversity come from?",

Don't believe me, search Google for \"Evangelicals and Donald Trump\".\n\nThis resentment runs deep. In high school, almost every Christian friend I knew registered Republican. I was the sole Christian Democrat. Anywho, before I continue, let me clarify what my stance is on religion.\n\n1. Just because I found a faith that is \"right for me\" does not necessarily mean people of other faiths are wrong.\n2. Just because someone else found a faith that works for them, doesn't necessarily mean I am wrong.\n3. Religion is a deeply personal topic.\n4. Nobody should be judged or coerced into practicing a religion.\n5. Religion should **never** be used as an excuse to marginalize and oppress people.\n6.

  "selftext": "In the United States, where I live, anyone over the age of 21 is technically allowed to get a sterilization surgery. However, many doctors refuse to sterilize people. Many doctors will only sterilize you if you are over a certain age or you have a certain number of children. The idea is that if a young child free person gets sterilized, he or she may regret it, later on, when and if the patient in question wishes to have children. Even if you can find a doctor willing to sterilize you, let’s see if your insurance is willing to pay for it. In some countries, it is actually illegal to undergo a sterilisation procedure unless you are over 40 years of age or you have had children before.\n\nIf you ask me, I believe that, as soon as you turn 18, you should be able to undergo a sterilisation procedure. If a doctor provides sterilisation procedures to some people, they should be required to provide it for all people. Doctors should not be allowed to discriminate for non-medical reasons.\n\nLet’s go over two concerns doctors have and why they refuse to provide these procedures to childless 18 year olds.\n\nConcern #1: You may regret having the procedure.\n\nIf you get sterilised and decide later on that you want kids, you could adopt, hire a surrogate or utilise the services of a sperm bank. Even if you have a sterilisation surgery and go on to regret it, at least that only affects you. You chose to have that sterilisation surgery, so it only affects you, that is completely fair. If, on the other hand, you want to have a sterilisation procedure and you are denied one, a child could be born to two parents who are not prepared to take care of him or her. If you can't get sterilised and you have an unplanned child, that child is statistically more likely to be abused or neglected and is statistically more likely to live in poverty. That isn't fair to the child who had no control over the circumstances of his/her own conception and birth.\n\nWhich is worse, regretting having a sterilisation procedure or resenting your children?\n\nConcern #2: At 18, your brain is not fully developed, so you are not mature enough to make that decision.\n\nThe part of the brain responsible for impulse control is not fully developed until the age of 25, that is true. Consequently, teenagers have notoriously pour impulse control. To remedy this issue, I propose we implement a mandatory 30 day waiting period. That way, impulse control is not a problem. Science teaches us that the teenage brain has knowledge and reasoning ability to make decisions ( [https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3051](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3051) ). Impulse control is the achilles heal of the teenage brain. You can impulsively have unprotected sex, smoke a cigarette, get involved in a fight or drive over the speed limit. Under the policy for which I advocate, you will not be able to go get a vasectomy or tubal ligation surgery on impulse.\n\nIf 18 year olds are not mature enough to undergo sterilisation procedures, then a lot of other age requirements need to be reconsidered. Here are a few things 18 year olds are legally allowed to do, that are significantly riskier than undergoing a sterilisation procedure.\n\nObtaining a driver’s license without the permission of a parent.\n\nA person who is 16 or 17 years of age can obtain a driver’s licence with the permission of a parent. As soon as you turn 18, parental permission is no longer required. Over 40,000 Americans died in car accidents in 2021.\n\n[https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&rlz=1C5CHFA\\_enUS959US960&oq=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&gs\\_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzQwMWowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS959US960&oq=how+many+americans+died+in+car+accidents&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzQwMWowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)\n\nI would bet money I do not have that the annual number of people who die as a result of having a sterilisation procedure is significantly lower than 40,000. Clearly, driving is significantly riskier than having a sterilisation procedure. Anyone who is mature enough to get a driver’s licence without parental permission is mature enough to undergo a sterilisation procedure.\n\nVote.\n\nThis one explains itself, it affects the entire country. At the age of 18, you are mature enough to decide what is best for your country, but not mature enough to decide what is best for yourself?\n\nBe held financially responsible for a child you produced.\n\nIn the United States where I live, child support laws basically say this;\n\nOnce a child is born, if both biological parents want to give the child up for adoption, that can happen. However, as soon as one biological parent decides that they feel like keeping the child, it then becomes the responsibility of the other biological parent to support the child financially, even if the latter never wanted the child in the first place. If the mother wants to keep the child, she can sue the father for child support. He might not have even wanted the baby. He might have wanted her to abort, she might have lived in a state where abortion is legal, she might have given birth anyway just to spite him, that does not matter. He is on the hook for child support weather he wants to be or not. On the other hand, if the mother gives the child up for adoption, the father is first in line for custody. I have no problem with that. What I do have a problem with is that the father can demand child support payments from the mother. To hear more about this issue, click this link ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/17d9ezv/you\\_should\\_be\\_able\\_to\\_opt\\_out\\_of\\_financial/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/17d9ezv/you_should_be_able_to_opt_out_of_financial/) ).\n\nAny requirement that you have to meet in order to have a sterilisation procedure, you should have to meet that same criterion to be held financially responsible for a child you do not want. If people under a certain age are not allowed to undergo permanent sterilisation, then you should not be forced to be financially accountable for a child, if you where under that age at the time of conception. If you should need to have a certain number of children before you are allowed to be sterilised, then anyone who has not chosen to parent that many children should not be forced to be accountable for an unwanted child.\n\nIf you are not mature enough to undergo a sterilisation procedure, then it follows logically that you should not be held financially responsible for a child you bring into the world, if you do not want to be financially responsible. It would not be fair to subject someone to adult responsibilities like forced child support payments, but then treat them like children who do not know what they want to do with their own lives.\n\nI would argue that there are many reasons why it would work the benefit of society to provide sterilisation procedures to anyone over the age of 18 who requests a procedure. Here are a few such reasons.\n\nReason #1: The belief that doctors have a duty to sterilise young childless people contradicts other conservative principles.\n\nThe people who most worry about a person regretting the decision to get sterilised and therefore believe that a doctor has a duty to not sterilise young childless people are often the same people who are morally against abortion. That is all the more reason for those particular people to want people to have access to sterilisation surgeries, as it will prevent unwanted pregnancies from happening, thereby preventing abortions.\n\nReason #2: It will benefit the people economically and improve the physical health of the general population.\n\nPlanned children are usually healthier. There is ample evidence that babies do best when women are able to space their pregnancies and get both prenatal and preconception care. The specific nutrients women ingest before they get pregnant can have a lifelong effect on the health of the offspring. Also, women are more likely to look after themselves during pregnancy if it was planned. Wanted babies are more likely to be welcomed into families that are financially and emotionally ready to receive them and to get preventive medical care during childhood. Therefore, more and more people having access to sterilisation surgeries will have economic benefits.\n\nReason #3: It is the most effective way of ensuring that the world population remains neither overpopulated nor underpopulated.\n\nIf every single person, who can reproduce, did so, the world would become over populated. On the other hand, if enacted the policy that existed in China at one point, where you where only allowed to have one birth per household, that would cause the planet to become underpopulated. If the right to marry and start a family is still a protected right but fewer people choose to exercise it, that is the most effective way of keeping the population at a Goldilocks size.\n\nHypothetical scenarios you ought to take into account.\n\nScenario #1: You are worried about giving birth to disabled kids.\n\nDr Phil once did a segment on the parents of a trio of blind and deaf triplets ( [https://youtu.be/TBjrn8zQgZo?si=0FFHvip03XipKrw6](https://youtu.be/TBjrn8zQgZo?si=0FFHvip03XipKrw6) ). If you are worried about this happening to you, so much so that you never want to have children, you should not have children.\n\nScenario #2: You may get pregnant from rape and be forced to give birth.\n\nImagine an 18 year old high school senior goes to a gynaecologist and asks for a tubal ligation surgery, because she recently went through a pregnancy scare and does not want to have to deal with that again. Her gynaecologist laughs at her condescendingly, because the doctor sees it as absurd the idea that just because you are legally old enough to vote and be tried as an adult in a court of law, that makes you mature enough to decide what you want to do with your life.\n\nFast forward 7 years. The now 25 year old woman falls pregnant after being raped. Because she lives in a state where abortion is illegal even in cases of rape, she has to give birth. Even though she is pursuing adoption, she still has to pay for the cost of prenatal healthcare. That is so costly, she has to move back in with her parents. Unsurprisingly, she is being slut shamed for ending up pregnant before marriage. When she explains to people that she was raped, a lot of people do not believe her. When people do believe her, they ask her a lot of questions about how the rape happened, to figure out what she could have done to prevent it, then they victim blame her for not taking those precautions.\n\nThe child is born. She gives the child up for adoption. The father gets custody of the child. Any laws about rape and the rights of victims would not apply in this case, as she did not report the rape. When a woman gives her child up for adoption, the father is next in line for custody and the father can take the mother to court and demand child support payments. That is what happens to this woman.\n\nIf the gynaecologist had just performed the tubal ligation surgery on the woman like the patient wanted, this could have been avoided. Because the doctor was paranoid about the possibility that the patient may regret having a tubal ligation surgery, the woman now had to give birth to an unwanted child and pay child support to her rapist.\n\nScenario #3: You might not be able to afford children.\n\nThis one explains itself.\n\nScenario #4:\n\nA woman already has four children and she has a medical condition that makes hormonal birth control not work. Her husband’s vasectomy fails. She has a high risk pregnancy with her fifth child.\n\nThe fear of people regretting having permanent sterilisation is irrational, not because it does not happen, but because even if it does happen, the potential consequences of regretting a sterilisation procedure is miniscule in magnitude compared to the potential consequences of having children you do not want.\n\nLook at the above hypotheticals. I would say that these hypotheticals are all much scarier than regretting a sterilisation surgery.\n\nDoes your doctor have a right to refuse the service?\n\nI am sure that at least some of you will probably agree with me that you have a right to obtain a sterilisation procedure, but your doctor has a right to deny you that procedure.\n\nI disagree. Imagine if a woman wanted to get a breast reduction surgery, to alleviate back aches and have an easier time finding bras that fit. Imagine the plastic surgeon refused her that procedure, because she is single and undergoing the procedure might make it more difficult to attract a mate. Should the plastic surgeon be allowed to do that?\n\nIf you said no, a plastic surgeon should not be allowed to discriminate based on marital status, why is it different if a urologist or gynaecologist discriminates based on the number of children you have? Both of these are clearly different from discriminating based on a medical issue. The doctor’s medical training enables them to understand, better than you, what will or won’t cause medical issues. However, a woman who has had a breast reduction surgery having a harder time attracting a mate and regretting a vasectomy or tubal ligation surgery are not medical issues.\n\nIf, however, you said that the plastic surgeon should be allowed to discriminate, I disagree. Click this link ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/16fl0td/businesses\\_should\\_not\\_be\\_allowed\\_to\\_discriminate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalOpinions/comments/16fl0td/businesses_should_not_be_allowed_to_discriminate/) ) to hear an argument that doctors should not be allowed to deny people breast reduction surgeries because of marital status. If, after reading that post, you still do not agree with me, tell me why.\n\nCounter arguments and my refutation of them.\n\nArgument #1: Your doctor, with all his/her medical training knows better than you what is best for you.\n\nThe question as to which is worse; resenting your children or regretting a sterilisation procedure, is a philosophical question.\n\nArgument #2: Doctors should be allowed to discriminate based on age and the number of children you have, just as doctors can discriminate when deciding who to prescribe aderall.\n\nDoctors should discriminate when prescribing adderall, because that is a medical issue. Their medical training enables them to know if being prescribed adderall is best for you or not.\n\nRegret is not a medical issue.\n\nBesides, while a person who undergoes permanent sterilisation may regret that, a person who has children could regret having children. You can decide for yourself which of those risks you would rather take.\n\nArgument #3: It is much less harmful for those who will not regret the sterilisation procedure to have the minor inconvenience of using birth control for a couple oif decades.\n\nFirst of all, I think it is a bit of an understatement to reduce decades of having to use birth control to a minor inconvenience.\n\nSecond of all, birth control can fail.\n\nThird, having to use birth control is not the worst thing that can happen to someone who is denied permanent sterilisation. You might resent your children.\n\nArgument #4: Just use the IUD.\n\nThree things.\n\nWhat about men who want (and are unable to obtain) vasectomies? That I know of, there is no male equivalent to the IUD.\n\nMany anti-abortion advocates take issue with the IUD, because it kills fertilised eggs ( [https://reproductiverights.org/iuds-are-like-abortion-wait-what/](https://reproductiverights.org/iuds-are-like-abortion-wait-what/) ).\n\nWhat if doctors started refusing to provide the IUD, as they are currently doing with tubal ligation surgeries?\n\nRegarding that last point, I do not know how likely that is to happen. However, it is theoretically possible, that is good enough.\n\nArgument #5: Resenting your children isn’t the result of a medical procedure.\n\nThat would be the the answer to the question; is resenting your children the result of a medical procedure?\n\nThe question is was asking was; Which is worse, regretting a sterilisation procedure or resenting your children?\n\nTelling me that resenting your children isn’t the result of a medical procedure does not tell me if resenting your children is worse, less bad or equally as bad as regretting a sterilisation procedure.\n\nArgument #6: Regretting sterilisation procedures happens more frequently than resenting your children.\n\nNot everyone who regrets having children reports it. Some of them claim to be happy when they are not. Therefore, we do not know (and probably never will know) for sure if this is accurate. Even if this is accurate, so what? It is likely the case that people committing felonies and getting away with it happens more often than people being wrongly convicted for felonies they did not commit. Does that mean that we should do away with the presumption of innocence?\n\nArgument #7: If you cannot purchase alcohol, you should not be allowed to have a sterilisation procedure.I happen to be in favour of lowering the drinking age to 18, so this does not even apply to me. However, even I can think of a reason why purchasing alcohol is riskier than having a sterilisation procedure.\n\nYou can impulsively buy alcohol. Under the policy for which I advocate, you would be required to wait a 30 day waiting period before undergoing the procedure.\n\nArgument #8: You are obligated to have children.\n\nThis argument essentially means that you should fulfill your duty to reproduce and anyone who has not fulfilled that duty should not be allowed to undergo permanent sterilisation.\n\nI disagree. To see an argument that having children is NOT your moral duty, click this link ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176ecg8/cmv\\_it\\_is\\_not\\_your\\_moral\\_duty\\_to\\_reproduce/](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/176ecg8/cmv_it_is_not_your_moral_duty_to_reproduce/) ). If, after reading that entire post, you still sincerely believe that it is your moral duty to reproduce, tell me why you still believe that.\n\nEdit; In the original draft of my post, I advocated for insurance companies to be required to cover the cost of permanent sterilisation. One commenter made an argument against that position. Therefore, I edited out the part about requiring insurance companies to cover the procedure. Everything else I said in the original draft of my post, I still stand by, hence why I did not edit out those parts.   \n",

  "selftext": "The fatal flaw of both Germany and Japan was overstretching themselves - attacking and conquering too many places at once and stretching their resources too thinly. I'll leave Japan out of this thread, though.\n\nHad Nazi Germany focused solely on conquering Russia and no one else, several thing would have happened, IMHO:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The western Allies (Britain, France, etc.) were still reeling from the horrific cost and trauma of World War I. They would have been quite reluctant to get involved in another war after WW1 had cost millions of men. With a very intense and skillful diplomatic campaign, Germany could very well have convinced the Brits and French, \"We are solely at war with Russia. This isn't worth it for you to get involved - you don't want to lose 6 million men again,\" especially considering that the western Allies were hardly friendly with Russia anyway. Indeed, it would have been in the best German interest to act as friendly towards the west as possible, since a 2-front war would be fatal.\n* The best path to invade Russia under such a scenario would be one that avoided Poland as much as possible, since Poland had a treaty with the Brits. Such a German path would involve passing through Romania and Ukraine.\n* The western Allies like Belgium, France and Britain weren't worth attacking to begin with. They offered relatively few gains to Germany but represented a massive headache in terms of resistance and cost. \n* Operation Barbarossa failed largely because of 1) American Lend-Lease aid to the Soviets and 2) Germany couldn't devote full resources to it because it was bogged down in Belgium, France, Africa, etc. If America had stayed out of the war and gave Russia no Lend-Lease aid (which it might have done if Japan had been persuaded to leave Hawaii alone and Germany didn't attack France or Britain,) and Germany had had more resources available due to fighting a 1-front war instead of 2-front war, it could have meant a stronger German punch against a weaker Russia.\n* Had such an attack succeeded, and toppled Stalin's regime by, say, 1940-1942, Germany would then set up a puppet regime in Moscow and spend a decade or two quelling insurgencies and firming up control over the region (the Reich empire would stretch from Germany to perhaps as far as the Urals - it's questionable what the fate of Siberia or anything east of the Urals would be in this situation) and trying to exploit the region's oil and natural resources to the max. We would then see a new Cold War - one that involved a western-Europe NATO against a Nazi Eastern Europe (rather than a communist East Europe.) It would also only be a matter of time, of course, before the Nazi empire was armed with nuclear weapons.",

  "selftext": "Should preface this by saying I’m not an economist. But based on recent conversations, it seems some people think specific freedoms and human rights are necessary for create a good economic situation. I strongly disagree with this, and there’s numerous historical examples that prove otherwise.\n\nMost European colonial empires were absolutely brutal in their treatment of native populations in the colonies, yet these empires made up nearly the entirety of the global economy. Specifically the British and French Empires. King Leopold would be a more “tame” example however, as most of his pillaging seemed to have been limited to the Congo. Hell, American treatment of the Philippines and Cuba was pretty brutal too.\nBarista’s regime in Havana was really authoritarian too, but the country was doing okay economically.\n\nMost of the Middle East is still extremely repressive on human rights, but most of the Gulf states are doing quite well for themselves. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE are fucking theocratic monarchies for crying out loud, and we all saw the horror stories during the soccer/football tournament last year. But have you seen how much money Saudi Arabia wastes, or looked at Dubai?\n\nThe same has been true historically as well. Ba’athist Iraq and Imperial Iran we’re clear dictatorships (and Iraqi treatment of the Kurds is still terrible). But prior to 1991 and 1979 respectively they each were huge regional economic players. \n\nThis is probably we’re I’m going to catch some flak. The Soviet and Eastern Bloc’s economy did okay for several decades, even using 3rd party numbers there was steady economic growth during most of the Cold War. That’s until their eventual stagnation, but I digress. And nobody will contest their authoritarian nature. \n\nMoving East, the PRC is the 2nd largest economy in the world. That’s after Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution, and all the other purges. China is doing okay, at least on paper, yet nobody will contest that their authoritarian.\n\nEven Western-backed countries in East Asia were authoritarian for most of the Cold War. When the South Korean economy exploded, they were cycling between various Juntas. For its short existence, South Vietnam was also doing okay economically, but was lead by a Junta during the 60s and 70s.\n\nI hope I made my point.",

  "title": "CMV: Clickbait sites that do compilations of old racist comics or other art are functionally commiting the same kind of racism as the original artists.",
  "selftext": "My title is pretty much as stated, but I do think the original artists are at least putting effort into their racism, which is maybe worse. I also think minstrel artists in the Jim Crow South accomplished more in worsening the conditions in their society for black and brown people than the clickbait sites I mention, and that their intention was more overtly racist. My argument is that these two evils are of the same *kind* not to the same *degree*.\n\nThe phenomenon I am describing is clickbait sites I get ads for on Facebook that show \"marvels 10 most racist characters\" and the thumbnail is basically a minstrel drawing. I don't think viewing old racist art is always bad. Obviously in an academic context it is important. I think the world is improved by having history academics who can say, with authority, here are the similarities I see between the first version of Spelljammer: Adventures in Space and Jim Crow minstrel drawings. I also think legitimate news publications showing this art, with content warnings, can be a good way to educate about the history of minstrel art, and show that some of it extended both geographically and chronologically past the Jim Crow South.\n\nI never read these clickbait articles, but I don't expect them to deal with the subject in a historically meaningful way for several reasons:\n\n1) They give no content warnings and showed me a racist depiction in the thumbnail. I was not shocked or offended, but some might be harmed in a similar (perhaps not as extreme way) as someone in the Jim Crow South seeing these images.\n\n2) I have read other articles from (I think) the same site as the most recent example I saw, and they do not make a point of handling the subject matter in any way other than presenting it.\n\n3) My definition of clickbait is to do the minimum work required on the article while laser focusing the title and thumbnail to shock, entertain, or entice, thus getting clicks for an article that no reasonable person actually wants to read. I cannot prove something is clickbait without reading it, but if it is, by definition it is not actually trying to communicate anything meaningful in the text of the article.\n\n4) Clickbait is undeniably a form of \"infotainment\" they do not intend for the content to improve the lives or worldview of the reader the way a proper publication should, they intend to make them snicker. The article/articles I am describing wants me to snicker at the bad representation of the past because of how dehumanizing it was. The intention of minstrel art was to make the audience snicker because of how not human they already thought the subjects of the art were. Laughing about propaganda in favor of atrocities is tone-deaf and cruel to the victims of those atrocities, even if you do it for the sake of belittling the propagandists.\n\nI want to see if my view can be changed because I am a white man, and the most I have ever been personally effected by minstrel art is that accusations of minstrel depictions threw a monkey wrench (no tone-deaf pun intended) in the release of the D&D setting update i have waited for since I started playing the game. I would like to hear more from people who are more directly hurt by these depictions.\n\nThings that can change my view:\n1) Someone who is emotionally impacted by viewing such art who have seen ads for articles like the one I described and thought it was a good (or at least neutral) thing that this clickbait sites was drawing attention to this problem.\n\n2) Someone who can convince me that people who republish minstrel art as a gag have done harm that is different in *kind* from the harm done by the people who first drew them (again, degree is not at issue).\n\n3) Academics on the subject that can reasonably say that this use of minstrel art is doing something different than it did in the Jim Crow South.\n\nEdit 1: I thought I was clear that I was talking about a similar kind of harm, not a similar degree (amount) of harm. I don't think I can judge the latter, as I am not directly harmed by these images.\n\nEdit 2: My position is changed to 'there is real harm in both.' no longer 'they are the same kind of harm, to different degrees.' the drawings in the Jim Crow South undeniably were intended to cause laughter at the subject, the clickbait articles are meant to cause laughter at the artists. Any harm done by irresponsible attempts at the latter is different harm than the former.\n\nEdit 3: My AirBnB mates are awaking and we will probably start playing boardgames soon. I cannot respond as much, but will try to later in the day. My opinion might be swayed to where it will end, up but it was swayed.\n\nEdit 4: I am back for a bit between games, and now believe that the evils are of the same kind if the author knew they were doing harm by sharing racist images with no warning, but did it anyway because outrage drives engagement.",

Since Mozart was sickly and probably spoiled af from his daddy, he never experienced getting his a-- kicked by anyone before. I already get wrestled by my little sis and big sis many times. I can finish him maybe after 3 rounds.  \n\nMichael Jackson is the strongest celebrity I can beat imo. He was said to be doing exercises in his prime so he's a bit challenging imo. He also experienced a lot of pain in his life that made him tougher. However, he didn't do weight exercises, only exercises about flexibility so I bet he can't carry 70kg sack of flour. I can carry that for 10 seconds. I think I can beat him if he's just chilling and I'm full of rage and bloodlusted. Or it could be a tie.\n\nEdit: In their prime",

During the great depression unemployment was through the roof and as a result a lot of people couldn't get the money together to keep their house many people ended up losing their house. \n\nToday however things are considered to be much better, everyone is working there's jobs everywhere and if you work 40 hours a week at a median paying job and save as much as possible you probably won't even be able to buy a house... \n\nSo let me get this straight, worst time in history people are not working and have a house, albeit barely and at risk of losing it. Now, people are working their asses off and have literally nothing to show for it... How exactly was the great depression worse? People can't even fucking protest because they are too busy working for ends meat and when people do protest the government just cracks down on them... Every related policy is designed to make housing go up and keep wages down, but unemployment is fine so all good right? \n\nInflation eats away at your meager savings, cost of living is basically doubling every 3-5 years and you're lucky if you get a 20% raise. How the fuck is this not worse than the great depression I would ask why alarms aren't going off about how unhealthy the economy is but the reason is obvious boomers got theirs and the media is bought and paid for by their interests not to mention the politicians.",

  "selftext": "I think being murdered by the state is an actual punishment only in as far as the condemned is suffering through the execution and/or terror induced by being on death row and/or humiliation because of the open display of the murder to the public and/or terror of leaving loved ones behind. Being dead doesn't have any potential to bother the condemned as there is noone/nothing left to be bothered. (If you believe in an afterlife, the afterlife just starts sooner, but it wouldn't last longer or shorter because of being executed per se.) Bringing the inevitable (death) forward in time cannot consitute a punishment in and of itself, because the condemned is not left to remember the bringing forward in time of death. The only thing that is taken from the condemned is something they were certain of losing at some point anyway. And even then, the life is cut short, but eventually there is noone whom it is taken from. As there is no consciousness experiencing anything having been taken away.\n\nIn short: The outlook of your life being cut short, with the execution being open to the public, knowing you leave loved ones behind, is a punishment for as long as you have left to live. The actual taking of the life is not a punishment, because a life being taken away is not experienced by the condemned at any point.\n\nPlease, change my view.",

After all, how would nations deliberate over who gets to keep their city name and who gets to change it? But within one nation or limited partnering nations (USA and Canada), this seems more than reasonable.  \n\n\nThis gets particularly thorny when identifying which city is being referred to when you are halfway between both locations. If I'm in Virginia and regale about my trip to Wilmington, am I referring to the one in North Carolina or Delaware?   \n\n\nA resident of one of these cities will struggle to find online resources pertaining to their city unless they append their state/province to the search, and even then it's not a perfect system.

Portland, Oregon, and Portland, Maine: These two cities are both popular summer seaside destinations on their respective coasts. Oregon's Portland gets a lot of press as Seattle's little brother, but when you live on the East Coast, you can never be sure which Portland is being referred to. Both Portlands are the most populous city in their states, so it's doubly head-scratching.   \n\n2. Springfield, Illinois, and Springfield, Massachusetts: Springfield is the 3rd most common city name in the United States. Springfield is the capital of Illinois, whilst the other is Massachusetts' 3rd most populous city.   \n\n3. Ontario, California and Ontario, Canada: Either one can be shortened to \"Ontario, CA\". This is doubly confusing because Ontario, California is home to an international airport, making the puzzlement all the worse.  \n\n4. Birmingham, Alabama, and Birmingham, Michigan: Might be confusing for those living in Rust Belt states. Birmingham, Alabama, is a larger city in the southern United States, while Birmingham, Michigan, is a suburb of Detroit.  \n\n5. Salem, Oregon, and Salem, Massachusetts: Both cities have historical significance, but they are located in different states. Salem, Massachusetts, is known for its witch trials history, while Salem, Oregon, is the capital of the state.\n\n6. Oxford: Oxford is a famous city in Oxfordshire, England. There is also a village called Oxford in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland.  \n\n\n7. Newcastle: There are two major cities named Newcastle in the UK. One is Newcastle upon Tyne in England, and the other is Newcastle in County Down, Northern Ireland.  \n\n\n8.

  "selftext": "Before the civil war that broke out in 2011, Syria was a relatively stable country that had a 0.691 HDI, just slightly short of \"high human development\" status (0.7 HDI or higher). After the civil war started, it became a fractured country that produced millions of refugees. While there are many reasons why this war happened, the West's role in supporting the Syrian rebels is a major factor. One can argue that this support was motivated by a desire to remove an oppressive regime and facilitate democracy. But, assuming that this was indeed the motivation rather than replacing Assad with a pro-Western client government, it would still be problematic. The two main reasons why are that a. the Syrian rebels' commitment to liberal democracy is highly debatable and b.  the West's track record in Middle Eastern regime change is not very good.\n\nIt is easy to imagine that the Syrian rebels were all good freedom fighters facing off against the evil dictator Assad but reality doesn't back this fantasy. Yes there was a secular movement called the Free Syrian Army that wanted liberal democracy in theory at least but plenty of other Syrian rebel groups were jihadists who wanted to turn Syria into a strict sharia state. To make matters more complicated, the secular rebels and the jihadist rebels often fought alongside each other, making it hard to distinguish between the two. So, by aiding the Syrian rebels, the West was in effect helping out jihadists, many of whom were affiliated with Al-Qaeda. If the Assad regime had collapsed, there would have most likely either been a strict sharia state in its place or another civil war, this time between the secular and the jihadist forces.\n\nIn addition to what was stated above, support for the Syrian rebels was a bad idea because recent history shows that Middle Eastern regime change doesn't work out very well. Take Libya for instance! The country originally experienced a civil war between the Gaddafi regime and motley of rebel groups. Did the Western-backed rebel victory over Gaddafi result in the creation of a stable democratic Libya? The answer is no. In a short time, the country experienced another civil war, this time between Islamist and secular factions that had previously fought against Gaddafi. If overthrowing a dictator who ruled over a relatively small population resulted in this mess (I am referring to Libya here), why would overthrowing a dictator who ruled over a much larger and more diverse population result in something better?\n\nI realize that this view of mine is controversial. If there is anything I am missing or if I am completely wrong, I would like to be corrected. I am, after all, just someone who has an interest in foreign policy, not a foreign policy expert.",

Mark my words, the removal of username number codes is going to mark the beginning of the end for what used to be one of the most revolutionary websites.\n\nSeriously, why? It's not fair to people who need to have the same username. Like let's say I've been \"Mike\" for 5 years, and Mike is taken. Well congrats, now I have to come up with some cringy xXx_M1k3_xXx nonsense just to get an account. (And YouTube has already done something like this recently and I can't see much benefit from that either.)\n\nThe folks over at Discord clearly didn't think this through because now there's going to be a mad rush for desirable usernames. People are already selling these OG accounts because \"they have precious names\", which completely runs contrary to the intended spirit of Discord. There's like no reason to force unique usernames. It's already causing people with common usernames to get bombarded with friend requests. And there are already allegations of favoritism with how more common usernames are handed out. They refuse to even take an ounce of the stinking heap of constructive criticism at their doorstep into consideration.\n\nIt reminds me of Lee Kuan Yew telling the people of Singapore to just try a banana when asked what if they wanted to use chewing gum to concentrate.\n\nBut the main point is, it's not so much the specific update itself, as it is the mods' clear-as-day refusal to listen to the community. They're up there in their high towers making whatever changes *they* think are right without hearing from *us*. Sure, they throw us bones and the like by hopping onto Reddit and discussing \"feedback\" and so on, but it's similar to the way news articles often have comments sections, and it'll do nothing.\n\nAnd as a result, ultimately I think Discord is committing virtual suicide with this move.

Arguments included:\n\n* It risks food poisoning (I found no evidence of this if you cook the chicken immediately after defrosting) \n* It doesn't taste as good (again, I found no evidence that the method of defrosting has any effect on chicken flavor, although using frozen vs fresh chicken does)\n* It has a textural difference (this seems the most plausible to me, but it must depend on cooking methods or styles—any time I've cooked quickly defrosted chicken there has been no discernible textural difference).\n\nIf you can provide solid, non-anecdotal evidence for any of the above or provide some other strong argument for quick defrost being worse to eat, my mind would be changed.

  "title": "CMV: AGI is impossible",
  "selftext": "There is no doubt that Artificial Intelligence has begun a new technological era and that it will have dramatic consequence on human life.\n\nHowever, Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as commonly defined, is an impossible fantasy.\n\nAGI is commonly defined as *an AI agent capable of accomplishing any intellectual task that a human being can*.  What people imagine when they speak of AGI is basically another human being that they could talk to that could give them better answers to any question than any other human being.\n\nBut I believe that achieving this with a machine is impossible for two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is that artificial intelligence, no matter how advanced, is fundamentally **incapable of understanding**. AI can certainly give the appearance of understanding. But the nature of Large Language Models like ChatGPT, for example, is that they work by statistical word-by-word prediction (I am told, even letter-by-letter prediction).\n\nThis is entirely different than understanding.  Understanding has to do with grasping the first principles of knowledge. It means \"standing underneath\" the thing understood in the sense of getting to the very bottom of it. Though, it is true, there is a lot that we don't understand, we are at least capable of it. I am capable of understanding what beauty is, even if my understanding is limited.  AI may able to spit out a definition of the word \"beauty\", but that not the same as understanding what the word means.\n\nThe bizarre errors that AI currently makes demonstrates its total lack of understanding (i.e., [https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13p7t41/anyone\\_able\\_to\\_explain\\_what\\_happened\\_here/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/13p7t41/anyone_able_to_explain_what_happened_here/) ) AI can only approximate understanding. It cannot achieve it.\n\nNow perhaps, someone might argue that the AI's lack of understanding is not a problem. As long as its knowledge goes deeper than a human beings knowledge in every area, it can still become better than humans at any intellectual task.\n\nBut this runs into a problem that is the second reason AGI is impossible: Namely, that **the world is infinitely, fractally complex**. This means that no AI model could ever be trained enough to make up for its lack of understanding. Sure, it can improve in its approximation of understanding, but this approximation will always contain errors that will spoil its calculations as they are extrapolated.\n\nBecause the world is infinitely complex, the complexity of the hardware and software needed to handle more and more advanced AI will increase exponentially.  There will soon come a time that the AI's ability to manage its own complexity will be an even heavier task than the tasks it was made to accomplish in the first place.  This is the same phenomenon that occurs when bureaucracies become so bloated they collapse or cease serving their purpose - they can become so complicated that just managing themselves becomes a more complicated task than solving the problems they were made to deal with.\n\nIn short, I expect AI to advance greatly, but due to the complexity of the world, AI will never be able to sufficiently compensate for its lack of understanding.  Sure, within specified, well-defined domains, it can certainly exceed human abilities in the way that a calculator exceeds my math abilities. But its lack of a grasp of first principles will prevent it from being able to integrate everything in the way that a human being is able to do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit #1:** After responding to many comments, it seems clear to me now that the fundamental disagreement in this debates comes down to whether one has accepted the philosophy of materialism. Materialism says that human beings are nothing more than matter. If that is the case, then, of course, why couldn't a machine do everything a human can do and more? However, I don't accept materialism for the following reasons:\n\n1. If humans were only matter, then what accounts for their unity of being? If I am nothing more than a heap of many atoms, then what makes me one single conscious person?\n2. If humans were only matter, then what accounts for their personal continuity over time? If I my molecules change out every few years, then why do I not cease to exist after a few years?\n3. If human beings were only matter, then how can they grasp universals? A particular is something here and now like \"this man.\" A universal something always an everywhere like \"man\" (as in humanity).  We gain our knowledge of universals through abstracting them from particulars. However, physical molecules in the brain are finite particulars. Therefore, there needs to be an immaterial part to us to be able to grasp universals which are not particular (edit: this formerly said \"finite\" instead of \"particular\", but particular is the better word).\n4. I think that good and evil, truth and falsity are not reducible to matter. Our mind can understand them. Therefore, we human beings have something immaterial to us.\n\nPerhaps this might sound religious to some people. But what I saying right now comes from Aristotle.\n\nIt was not my intention to have a philosophical discussion like this, but the objections people are bringing seems to make it necessary.\n\n**Edit #2**: I am a bit surprised at how unpopular my position is. I felt that I made at least a reasonable case. As of now, 9 out of 10 voters have downvoted it. (**Edit #3:** now it has an upvote rate of 31%, but reddit's upvote rate seems glitchy, so I don't know what the truth is).  Perhaps my claim is perceived as too sweeping saying that AGI is fundamentally impossible rather than saying it is nowhere near within sight. I did give a delta to the person who expressed this the best. Nevertheless, I am surprised by how many people for some reason seem repulsed by the idea that human beings could perhaps be something more than computers.",

One way to do this is for those buildings to have their ground floor completely open aside from the elevator/stairs to access the apartments. That way:\n\n* everyone can walk in mostly straight lines to their destinations, literally \"across\" buildings.\n* the lower part of buildings can sort of become \"park\"-style empty areas.\n* residents of the city could open up businesses, restaurants, etc. in the ground floor\n\nThis is how many of the buildings in my university work.\n\nBut there is actually precedent for this on the city level, even in the US!

  "selftext": "There are plenty of heterosexual women in the dating market, but the incel theory goes that they are monopolized by a few extremely successful men. This would have to mean that these men are shared among multiple women, either serially through one-night stands or short-lasting relationships, or simultaneously through cheating, friends with benefits, or polyamory. However, those arrangements are not traditionally what women want. While women's attitudes have changed somewhat, I think most women still aspire to a long-term monogamous relationship at some point in their lives.\n\nPossibilities:\n\n1. Actually, women do prefer casual sex with more attractive partners\n\nI think this is true to an extent. If a woman is not ready to settle down yet, she might pursue this path for part of her life.\n\n2. Women are mistaken or deceived into believing they have the prospect of a long-term relationship with men in high demand on dating apps\n\nI'm sure it happens, but I give women enough credit that they'll eventually learn their lesson that the kind of guy with dozens of matches often doesn't deactivate his account when they start dating.\n\n3. Their minimum standard is the top matches.\n\nI don't think so. Women are generally capable of emotion-driven attraction.\n\n4. They are looking for a long-term relationship, but men are not.\n\n5. They give it a go at a long-term relationship with an average man, but the relationship does not satisfy their expectations. They return to casual dating or give up and remain single.\n\n6. They successfully find a mutually fulfilling relationship with an average guy.\n\n1 and 2 are temporary conditions. Average guys might have to accept that their dating options are limited within the 20-something age bracket, though. 3 is only true for a small fraction of the straight female dating pool, I think. 4 and 5 are within men's power to bend toward 6 by leveling up their relationship skills.\n\nMaybe try this pickup line at a NYE party: \"I haven't had a date in a year, so if you kiss me tonight, I'm pretty much a sure thing for Valentine's Day, Christmas, and NYE 2025.\"\n\nHow you can change my view\n\n- There is actually a shortage of women in the heterosexual dating market, with many women choosing women or celibacy.\n- 1, 2, or 3 are more prevalent than I think.\n- The kind of relationship skills needed for 5 are not achievable for many men.",

  "selftext": "Hey fellow Redditors, I'm here to discuss a topic that I believe deserves more attention and understanding – Long COVID. It's not just a fleeting post-infection issue; it's a serious health crisis affecting millions worldwide. \n\nEdit: I think we should mask regularly in public situations, consider changing our gathering habits during the holidays/December (seems to be the best time to spread respiratory viruses worldwide). I also think we should primarily focus on providing clean air indoors / in our homes and otherwise.\n\nLet's dive into the evidence:\n\nComprehensive Overview of Long COVID Biomedical research has made significant strides in understanding the complexities of Long COVID. This review explores the global scenario, emphasizing key findings, variable symptom onset, the impact on children, and vaccination considerations. Despite progress, diagnostic and treatment options are inadequate, stressing the urgency of prioritizing clinical trials.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2 \n\n\nCOVID-19 illness severity and 2-year prevalence of physical symptoms: an observational study in Iceland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark Those diagnosed showed a 37% higher prevalence of severe physical symptom burden compared to those not diagnosed. Symptom prevalence correlated with acute COVID-19 severity, with individuals bedridden for seven days or longer demonstrating the highest prevalence. Among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19, eight of the fifteen measured symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue, were significantly elevated. Repeated measurements confirmed consistent results throughout the study period.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00175-8/fulltext \n\nNeurological Health Crisis The neurological impact of COVID-19 is immense, with over 70% of infected individuals experiencing persistent symptoms, including cognitive dysfunction. The study delves into the role of reactive microglia and the urgent need for research on emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nhttps://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(22)00910-2.pdf \n\n\nGlobal Impact and Lifelong Consequences Long COVID is estimated to afflict a staggering 65 million individuals globally, with significant consequences for their lifelong health. The condition affects multiple organ systems and poses risks for both symptomatic and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/16/12962 \n\n\nInsights from the Canadian Perspective The 2023 Canadian COVID-19 Antibody and Health Survey brings attention to the Canadian experience. Alarmingly, 3.5 million adults in Canada reported long-term symptoms, impacting their daily lives. The study outlines challenges in healthcare access and highlights vaccination trends among different demographics.\n\nhttps://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2023001/article/00015-eng.htm\n\nI'm open to hearing different perspectives on this.

The problem is that even If you are choosing what you do, from a Godly perspective, life is still predetermined because God has created your motivations behind every thought and action, knowing what outcome would occur.",

This is partly because of the inflation problem that had reached a 13-year high in the US while going down now is still bad. Biden’s advanced age and his failure to deliver on his promises also hurt his chances.\n\nInflation is hurting many Americans, as prices have gone up and some businesses are taking advantage of the situation. People tend to vote based on how the economy affects them and compare it to the alternative.\n\nThis country has a long history of bigotry that many white liberals (who are the majority on this website) often overlook until someone like Trump or Nikki Haley in 2008 exposes it. There is even a SNL skit that mocks this tendency . Trump revived his political career by repeating right-wing conspiracy theories in 2012 . David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, almost became the governor of Louisiana in 1991 . Storm Thurmond served in the Senate till the late 90s. People would deny themselves subsidized healthcare because a black man pushed for them to have it. Black People have to play into respectability politics to garner sympathy for being murdered by the police. The fact that Republicans can quote Goebells win talking about Trans people and get relented is bad. These examples show how racism and intolerance are still prevalent and influential in American Politics.\n\nBiden’s inability to keep his promises will be his downfall. He has not stopped the detention of children and asylum seekers at the border . He let his build back better plan be gutted by Republicans and Manchen, even though he had a majority in both the Senate and the House. He could have repealed the Senate rule that allows filibusters without having to speak continuously . He also might face a Hillary Clinton problem, where Black voters who have few options in America don’t turn out to vote for him because of his capitulation to Republicans on police reform and his failure to pass a voting rights bill for Black people .",

  "selftext": "I hold the view that regulating essential necessities, like food, water, shelter, energy, information, justice, representation, and healthcare, can create a balance between ensuring access for all and fostering innovation through capitalism. Here's the crux of my argument:\n\nTackling Root Causes: By addressing the expenses that influence rising costs for everything from energy to materials, we can work towards reducing the overall cost of living.\n\nBalancing Profit Incentives: Critics often argue that heavy regulation stifles profit incentives, which drive innovation and efficiency. However, I believe that it's possible to regulate to ensure accessibility and affordability while still allowing room for innovation.\n\nEnsuring Affordability: Affordability, especially in sectors like healthcare, is a valid concern. My view is that we should create mechanisms that prevent private alternatives from becoming prohibitively expensive through competition and a ground floor of acceptable service/products.\n\nNavigating Regulatory Challenges: Regulating multiple sectors is complex. I propose designing efficient regulatory frameworks that minimize bureaucracy and inefficiencies, potentially leveraging private sector expertise.\n\nSustainable Implementation and Funding: Critics often worry about the funding of such initiatives. I think it's crucial to establish transparent, sustainable funding models that minimize economic disruptions while ensuring basic needs are met.\n\nStriking Competitive Balance: Striking the right balance between public and private providers is crucial. We should encourage competition and innovation without compromising access and affordability.\n\nDefining Necessities: The definition of \"necessities\" can be subjective. While basics like food, water, and shelter are universally acknowledged, other areas like information and justice might require a more nuanced discussion.\n\nI'm open to changing my view on this, so I'm looking for constructive arguments that might shift my perspective.

  "selftext": "I have a counter point to Peter Singer's argument which I haven't personally seen.\n\nHe says that if you see a drowning child in a muddy pond, you should be willing to ruin an expensive suit to save the child. Anyone who wouldn't save the child because they didn't want to ruin their clothes is a bad person, we can all agree. \n\nBut if we agree with him that 1) all lives, regardless of proximity are the same value, 2) the suit would genuinely be ruined (ei, can't be cleaned or repaired), and 3) your money goes further in poorer countries. Then what you should *actually* do is not save the child at all, as it would ruin your suit, and then go sell your suit and give the proceeds to a very effective charity, possibly saving hundreds of lives with mosquito nets or something. \n\nSo consider now that you meet a man and he says he saw a child drowning, but did nothing, and he says \"don't worry, I've decided to sell my suit that I kept mud free and I will save many more lives than I could have by saving that child.\"\n\nIs that a good person? A better person than you who had the instinct to save the person infront of you?\n\nIn an AMA Singer said plainly that you shouldn't give money to homeless people in the developed world because your money can save more people in poor countries. So I think this analogy is pretty apt. Singer would say that if you see someone starving in your own country, you should feel no need to help them, because food is more expensive where you live than somewhere else. \n\nI'm sure some will say I'm taking the conclusion too far. But the argument Singer makes is quite strong in its conclusion. I think if you truly take it seriously you would have to agree that anyone in developed countries who has cancer should **absolutely** not be treated. Do you know how cheap mosquito nets are?\n\nDo any of us truly believe that we should not be allowed any healthcare or social services because money needs to be spent at peak efficiency?\n\nI suppose it's a general counter point to utilitarianism. But I think Singer's framing really convinces people and it's worth using his same framing as a counter point, rather than arguments such as the hospital that steals one person's organs to save 5. Singer's argument is flawed in my opinion because it logically nessesitates a race to the bottom when it comes to quality of life, and I think that means a worse world overall. If we as a society embraced his viewpoint we would need our governments to end all social programs, send all healthcare money overseas where to goes further etc.\n\nEdit: link to Peter's comment on homelessness as it's come up a bunch: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/32lnif/im_peter_singer_australian_moral_philosopher_and/cqccnqu/\n\nOff to bed folks. Gave one delta for Singer possibly not meaning that homeless people should starve but just shouldn't be helped beyond food. It's a significantly different reading from mine so it's a worthwhile point. I'll respond to more tomorrow if there are more.",

In this case if people had to fund the true cost of  car ownership, I believe less car usage would occur, with people opting for public transports far more often, which has a whole list of positive externalities.\n\nA few typical rebutals I get, and my replies to those:\n\n*1) but there is no/poor public transports*\n\nSee bold\n\n*2) but public transports are unpleasant*\n\nSince  the state will no longer be massively subsidizing car-driving, that money can go towards public transports. There are countries where  public-transport qualities is excellent.\n\n*3) but I like cars and driving*\n\nSo do I. But I just want to pay the fair cost of that. Its not, IMO, the state's role to subsidies people's hobbies.\n\n*4) but I can't afford public transports, yet I can afford a car.*\n\nCars  (very) rarely are end-user cheaper, but if they somehow are, that'll  stop being the case with my policy proposal. At this point you can  perfectly consider free public transports for students and/or underaged  people, discounts for lower incomes, etc.\n\n*5) but I have special physical needs*\n\nPublic  transports can, and have been, adapted to that effectively. The biggest  hindrance to wheelchair access in many places I've went to was actually  sidewalk space taken-up by cars, damaged sidewalks from cars, cars on  cross-walks, etc.\n\n*6) but I like the confort of a car.*\n\nAnd that's fine, but just pay a fair price for that. Its not, IMO, the state's role to subsidies people's convenience.\n\n7) *but what if policy changes suddenly and all the public options are taken away*\n\nA very fair concern. I don't have a magic bullet for that, but at the same time, this is simply a general reality of any polity, and goes beyond the scope. Yes, rights can be taken away, and that's part of political realities.\n\n8) *but surely cars have more benefit than costs*\n\nYes, but also no. Cutting-off your arm to prevent you from dying off an infection has more benefit than costs. But there is an alternative, which are antibiotics. Therefore the (opportunity) cost of opting to cut your arm instead of taking a few pills is huge. The actual nominal cost-per-car varies a LOT from country to country, but in central / western Europe even conservative estimates put the subsidies at >5'000€ per vehicle. Looking at France's fuel policy subsidies at the moment can indicate how massive the cost can be.\n\n9) *but my country is too big / mountainous / natural disasters to have public transports*\n\nSwitzerland has arguably the best network in the world, and is an alpine country. Japan is a massive, mountainous, island country full of earthquakes, and has arguably the second best network.\n\n10\\*) but freedom???\\*\n\nYou're free to drive, all I ask is for you to pay a fair price.",

Other countries started expeditions & colonization, “Hey, what should we call these people?”  “The Spanish called them Indian because they were originally looking for India when they found them, but it’s not actually India.”  “Fuck it, Indian works, let’s stick with that.”  And we did, for 500 fucking years.  How is this not an objectively hilarious indictment of white people?\n\nNow when it comes to actual the use of the term, I’m not in the group so I don’t get a say but I listened to a podcast years ago where they said a plurality of that group actually prefers the term Indian (I can’t find it to link so feel free to show me I’m wrong).

  "selftext": "A lot of this is based on personal experience, so take that as you will, and it seems many of these problems tend to apply more to men than women.\n\nSome years ago, I used to play a lot of Street Fighter (Street Fighter V specifically).  I got to the point where I started going to tournaments and played it way more than anything considered just a hobby.  I got that thought into my mind that I could win some tournaments and make some money and go from there.\n\nIn the meantime, my body suffered and I got super out of shape, I wasn't social with anyone but my geeky friends, I was single of course, and I even started to develop a slight temper for whenever I would lose.\n\nLife circumstances changed when I decided to move overseas, and when I got to a place where the internet was no longer good enough to consistently play these games seriously, they sort of faded from my life.  I do still enjoy playing them (I log onto SF6 now and then), but it feels like on top of personal changes, the minute competitve games like this disappeared from life, everything improved dramatically.  I made all the personal changes that mattered and now I don't miss the scene behind these games or the lifestyle behind them at all.\n\nI know gamers are an easy target, but watching from a distance, I can see now why communities like the fighting game community, Super Smash Bros. and League of Legends scene are reviled.  They encourage people to waste hours of their life on something that takes away from the rest of their life, causing people to sacrifice opporunities like love, friends, physical and mental health, other hobbies, experiences, etc.\n\nMy brother, who is much younger than me, still participates in these kind of game scenes just seeing his reaction to losing a game of LoL makes me never want to touch games like that again.\n\nYes, I know there is a lot of positive to these games, and I'm not advocating that anyone shouldn't play them.  I love video games and I think there is a lot of positive they can provide to someone's life.  \n\nCompetitive games, however, are a different story.  For all accolades and prize money, it seems the price they enact on your personal life is absolutely not worth it.",

  "title": "CMV: Corporations have no moral responsibility except to maximize profits",
  "selftext": "Hello, this view has bugged me for years because I love browsing reddit but I overall disagree/have the redditor's view that corporations are to blame in any immoral outcomes to the society.\n\nFirst let's put aside the legal responsibility, as it is irrelevant. Some likes to argue whether corporations are required to maximize profit or not and I think its a strawman argument. I do not believe that they are legally required to, but in a free market, they have to maximize profit to remain competitive.\n\nBut back to the main point, let's say a corporation were to do a series of actions that are **legal.** But as a result has harmed the society/environment/consumers etc. In this scenario, the corporations and as an extension of that (the executives/management etc) is free from any wrong doing.\n\nUltimately it is the responsibility of the government/policies maker to determine what is legal/what isn't.\n\nOne could easily (and often redditors do) point to the management as the devil. E.g. CEO of XYZ is so god damn evil!!!1!11. I don't follow this logic? The corporation system is setup such that the shareholders are looking for max profits, and the CEO and management team is rewarded for doing so. Sure there are companies like Apple that chooses to pursue environmental initiatives at the cost of profits but  that is at a time when the company is massively profitable. If that wasn't the case the shareholders would not be pleased and the management team would be changed. If other corporations decides not to do so, that should be completely acceptable. Sure, consumers/investors can choose to penalize such corporations for their external negative impacts. But that rarely happens. Because most people don't actually care.\n\nAnother argument I often hear is that large corporations will \"bend\" the rules and so the fact that they are doing everything legally is not exactly \"playing by the rules\". And I would partially agree with this, in that the corporations should share some fault here. But I would argue that a bigger share of the blame should be put in the political systems instead. Why are the systems so easily bribed? When a cop takes $1000 from a druglord and turns a blind eye. Should we be angry at the cop? The druglord? Or both? Certainly, not just the druglord?! That's what reddit does, day in day out.\n\nBottom line:\n\n\\- Reddit has immense hate on corporations (evident on the front page), unjustified\n\n\\- Reddit attributes almost 100% of the bad outcomes to corporations and executives, unjustified\n\n\\- My opinion is that corporations/CEO are simply cogs of a system doing its job. The political systems/tax systems/legislative systems/etc are all to blame for bad outcomes\n\nEDIT: as evident even in this post's downvotes. Reddit cannot tolerant the idea of a neutral corporation. I don't get it.\n\nEDIT2: some have brought up the point of profit vs shareholder value. A valid edit, but my post can be rewritten with profit replaced by shareholder value and the argument would still be the same. CEOs are hired by the shareholders, both of which is striving for maximum share holder value (however they wish to define it). If by doing so, results in a harm to society, that's really the fault of the government more than anyone else.\n\n**EDIT3: There has been a lot of confusion by the young redditors,** that if human have morals and companies are made up of humans, then companies should have morals responsibilities. No they do not. Company is a human designed construct to function a certain way, and moral responsibilities are purposely left out of it in order to achieve maximum effect (shareholder value). **Another good example** of such situation is a lawyer. It would be immoral to help a murderer get out of a conviction even though the killer has told you the flat truth that he indeed has killed someone. But that's EXACTLY what a lawyer would have to do by duty. And that does not make the lawyer **HIMSELF** immoral. Because the lawyer position is a human created role/construct where we want that role to function a certain way for the benefit of the justice system as a whole.",

I disagree with any liberals who say that equality is inherently valuable, or that there are such things as intrinsic human rights (for any groups).\n\nYet I find myself agreeing with liberals on specific issues, albeit for conservative reasons... the main one having to do with competition on both individual and national levels.\n\nFor example, while I don't believe we should defend equality for its own sake, I do think there should be more income equality in the US as a means to spurring competition in our economy, in education, in technology, and so forth.\n\nLikewise, while I don't believe any minority groups have inherent rights, as nobody has ever proven that such universal, intrinsic rights exist, I still prefer to live in a society in which all minority groups are thriving as this makes for more competition within our country and also makes us a stronger nation as a whole in the face of competition or conflict with other countries.\n\nFor similar reasons, I also agree with the left on climate change, abortion, and a few other issues.\n\nSo I tend to think of myself as a conservative with liberal views.\n\nIt could be objected that my overarching \"conservative philosophy\" doesn't matter if it doesn't distinguish me from a typical liberal. But I think it does. For reasons that I won't fully spell out here, I think certain levels of conflict and competition are inevitable on the global scale. So while a more liberal minded person might hope for a world in which adversarial relationships disappear and that we embrace our common humanity, I think that's unrealistic and thus embrace a nationalistic political attitude that supports our nation and allies over adversaries (like Russia and China). \\[And just to be clear, I don't support any form of nationalism that puts one race or religion over others in our country.\\]\n\nIn sum, I think we should build up all of our communities and cultural groups, not for liberal reasons of guilt, morality, or universal human rights, but simply because it's better for us to be stronger than weaker, more prosperous than less prosperous, and suchlike.",

But the reality is that, for most people, BMI is actually not a bad way to measure their overall health, if they're going to just use one metric. Regardless of precise it is, BMI has been shown to generally correlate with specific health outcomes. It's pretty reasonable to say \"if you have X BMI, you're more likely to get Y disease\" if you can cite scientific consensus, and all you know about their health is their height and weight. You'd be backed by decades of scientific literature.\n\nFurthermore, for public health, there is no good alternative. We have tons of bulk data for height and weight. Widespread availability of data is the only way to have consistent and standardized comparisons across different populations. We don't have nearly as much body fat or A1C data etc. Furthermore, BMI is simple and almost completely standardized. A lot of other metrics are measured and reported in different ways; they're just not going to be as reliable as BMI for public health.\n\nOf course, an athlete with a high BMI should not necessarily be considered obese, and someone who has high BMI due to underlying health conditions should prioritize treating the underlying condition. There are people who are \"skinny fat\" and face all the same health risks that obese people have. But that doesn't mean BMI is a bad metric.

Both are praised for leading awareness of said issue. I am gonna state the obvious so no one gets the wrong idea, CLIMATE CHANGE IS ABSOLUTELY REAL. The science is settled on that issue.\n\nHowever, both still contribute more to the problem than the average person by trotting around in private jets, and both live in multiple properties that eat up more of electricity than some some third world countries.

They also rail against social media (particularly twitter/facebook), yet still use it and believe it is an \"important tool\" in society.\n\nWhile there is aspects of capitalism I dislike, I cannot be an anti-capitalist because I still believe it has a place in society, and that would make me a flagrant hypocrite.

However, there isn't good evidence that a god exists. Especially considering how many religions there are, how would I even know which religion to believe? And there are too many contradictions within many religious texts (such as saying that God is benevolent but then providing many examples of extreme cruelty). \n\nAnother possible objection could be the community or sense of peace people get from a god. But you can find those through other measures, and religion just as commonly can harm people as help them.\n\nBenefits of not having a god includes being able to live your life how you want, unladen by religious guilt. Another benefit is not being able to have your faith manipulated to do something bad such as a war or persecution.\n\n\n**I should mention that I'm specifically talking about religions that believe in a god.

It’s odd to have a law that the majority of the population breaks. IMO it creates a disrespect for the law in general.\n\n2. When I went to college, because I wasn’t allowed to get alcohol safely, at a restaurant with friends, our only option was to go to a frat house and drink the punch that they could have put anything inside of. I personally know a girl that was raped after a frat party. Outlawing drinking until you’re 21 just makes people put themselves in dangerous positions to drink.\n\n3. The age was raised to 21 in order to lower the amount of drunk drivers. I agree if you drive after drinking then you’re a terrible person. But the type of person who would drive drunk definitely isn’t the type of person who would listen to the law about waiting until you’re 21 to drink.\n\n4. When I joined my sorority the very first meeting they had all the new members bring photos of ourselves we took at CVS along with filling out a form with our info. They did this so they could place an order for fake ID’s for all the new members. My point in sharing this is to show how common fake ID’s are. Like most freshmen in college get fake ID’s. The problem with this IMO is that we are giving money to people who probably aren’t the best (think cartels and gangs who make the fake IDs)",

Now, you're probably wondering what makes me have any right to say this. The fact is, I'm currently attending high school. I have multiple points that go beyond the idea that school teaches you stuff that isn't helpful.\n\nFirstly, the man who first made homework, Roberto Nevelis, originally created it as a punishment for students who wouldn't listen in his lectures. Nowadays, this punishment has become a normal day practice.\n\nSecondly, it is rumored that Frederick J. Kelly, the creator of standardized testing, said it is too cruel to be used and should be abandoned. If the creator of something is telling you how awful it is, that should be a clear sign that something is wrong.\n\nLastly, the most commonly stated but most true point is that school treats every student the same. They treat every student as if they learn the exact same way, ignoring their uniqueness. Some classes claim you are original, yet they teach the same thing for every class and every student.\n\nIn my personal account with my school, they may say they like creativity, but most of our creative programs lose funding so they can fund football.

  "selftext": "I am posting this here since this is my (obviously) subjective judgementt about many of the big tech companies, and I would like to evaluate whether this belief is wishful thinking, partially true or simply outright flawed\n\nMy belief is roughly twofold, as follows:\n- Society as a whole is better off with Google than without it. Indeed, they provide services that are incredibly empowering to nearly everyone: access to information via powerful search, communication via Gmail, organization via Google Drive, Sheets and Docs, navigation via Google maps, ... Many of these services (at least the basic versions) are provided free of charge and are extremely user-friendly. Especially for low-income groups (e.g. students, poorer countries, ...), this is empowering and improves their quality of life.\n- Society is worse off with Meta than without it (by extension, all companies whose main focus is social media). Namely, the explosive growth of Facebook and similar platforms has contributed to a large extent to the incredible polarization in society (which can be attributed to a large extent to \"anger\" as a main engagement driver to keep people for longer times on the platforms, for ad exposure, and to the now well-known \"echo chambers\" which tend to form on social media platforms). Also, I hold social media accountable for the rise in mental health problems (especially in younger users), e.g. by promoting unrealistic expectations, increased social pressure, etc. Facebook seems to have become a de-facto place for news consumption by many users, which has sparked an incredible number of fake accounts / bots that steer comment sections and pages propagating fake news. Maybe this is not directly Meta's fault, but I observe the effect. Google did not seem to suffer from this \"fake account tsunami\" problem, despite there being fake-news YouTube channels as well, of course. It just seems to me like Google has not meaningfully shifted news consumption away from \"regular\" media (which I conisder important so that every citizen can have a shared basis of facts and trustworthy news). If Meta and their platforms would cease to exist tomorrow, it may be a mild annoyance in the beginning, but we'd get over it quickly and we would benefit from improved mental health (less inflated feelings of anger, feeling offended, ...). \n\nPoints that go against this belief that I've already considered, but find insufficient:\n- \"WhatsApp is an incredible free communication service as well!\" True, but Facebook didn't develop it, they acquired it. So WhatsApp would have existed even without any large social media company buying them (not considering their profitability for the moment). Also, without WhatsApp, it seems like Hangouts could have filled that vacuum and might have grown into a similar, feature-rich and widely used communication app.\n- \"YouTube is also a social medium on which echo chambers exist, and which can promote hate and polarization!\". True. Nonetheless, the scale seems different compared to e.g. Facebook, and massive polarization seems to have increased mostly once Facebook started really growing big (with YouTube having been around for longer already).\n\nI understand that both companies have similar business models based on advertising revenue and that there services are paid for by (often privacy-unfriendly) exploiting of user data. However, the way in which this is done (based on the arguments above) seems substantially different.\n\nMy belief is likely incomplete or flawed. I admire Google for their contributions, as stated above, while I wish Meta never existed (even though I have used their products, most ly due to the \"preferential attachment\"/platform effect where I want to be able to interact with other people that happen to heavily use the platform).\n\nChange my view!",

I can see why other people want it (but again, their reason is just that *they want them.*) They’re loud, expensive, messy, and will prevent me from completing my goals in life. One argument at a time: \n\n- They’re LOUD and high-maintenance. Waking up at 3 AM because your baby is crying for 2 years in a row sounds like a nightmare, especially when you have to wake up for work the next morning. This is not to mention that for the first 5 years, you basically can’t leave them alone, and for the 7 years after that you’re grounded where you are and very limited in what you can actually do, and your freedoms, because uprooting them would damage their development. \n- Suddenly your life as a parent becomes about your children. You have to wake up an hour early to get them dressed, cook for them, take them to school, then spend extra time to take them to extracurriculars, do their laundry, read to them, help them with their homework, bathe them depending on their age, etc. It’s a job before and after your job… you’ll be lucky to get an hour of free time on weekdays. Then you’re also on the hook for them on weekends. You have to plan your vacations around them.  \n- They’re **expensive**. It’s estimated that children on average cost $310k for the first 18 years of their life. In the search to give my child a better QOL, I would most certainly shell out more for them. How can I rationalize having a child, especially in this economy? $100K combined as a DINK is an extremely comfortable lifestyle. $100k combined with children is miserable. If my goal in life is to travel the world, how could I seek to have children while also not losing that which makes me happy in life, unless I can guarantee myself a well-paying job? Not to mention the aforementioned concerns that I’d have to be bolted down for my child. \n\nMy goals in life are to enjoy myself and travel… to amass knowledge in all corners of the world, to become comfortable and live a comfortable life. \n\nNot to mention climate change, a fragile economy, and high prices making the child’s life far harder than it would have been in, say, the 80s.\n\nFor these reasons, I don’t think that having a child would ever make sense.

In addition to eating other animals, we ate ourselves. Yes, most of our ancestors were likely cannibals, though the reason why is debated, as humans apparently weren't super nutritious.\n\nOf course, humans have evolved to find other reasons to hate and kill.

I've grown to hate it a bit, but it pays the bills, and my pupils leave very happy so win-win. That said, I'm not a HS/middle school math teacher, so I'd be intrested in hearing your thoughts from you.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the things that I find is a huge stepping block in mathematical development is the confortable manipulation of algebraic expresions. This is probably the single most important skill to develop in HS mathematics (fight me), as you will need it almost anywhere in higher mathematics, physics, economics, etc. Thankfully, in many ways working with algebraic expresions is analogous to working with numbers.\r  \n\r  \nExcept you don't have a calculator for those. A good example is fraction addition, multiplication or division. One of my pupils (who is 17-18 mind you) got stumped because during an equation she got X/(1/2). Then I found out she did not know how to divide fractions. And this is not an isolated insident, I've seen countless students utterly terrified of fractions. Even if they have a feign memory of how to do it, they never do, because it's just easier to plug it into your calculator. But when you have to solve x/2 + 1/x = 3 that is not gonna do it for you. Other obvious examples is strugling to simplify obvious expressions like 1/2+1/2.\r  \n\r  \nAnother good example is working with exponents. Rather than doing 2\\^(-1/2) using properties, I've seen a lot of students who just plug it into their calculator. And sure, they get an aproximation, but once you have an algebraic expression, all that fails.\r  \n\r  \nWith one of my students we were learning about logarithms, their parents got her one of those better calculators that can calculate the logarithm with any base. I thought that was a shame since it's so easy to use the change of base property, or 99% of the time just thinking for 2 seconds what the answer is (these problems are made to spit out nice numbers).\r  \n\r  \nLook, I'm not an \"algorithm\" guy at all. I love teaching in a more conceptual way and I find my students are a lot more engaged and end up understanding more (in fact in my experience the opposite is true, teachers don't explain enough and just make students do problems without much context). But some algorithms really are important, and you 100% do use them anytime you work in mathematics, such as fraction addition, working with exponents, etc. I don't mind if a hs student forgot how to do long division, as that is a very specific algorithm. This is much more serious.\r  \n\r  \nI also know full well that calculators are not all to blame for this lack of confidence in manipulating algebraic expressions, but it certainly doesn't help. This is why I don't mind certain tests or sections having \"no calulators allowed\". They need to be well made, like obviously we don't want students to waste time doing tedious calculations (and no, doing 1/2 + 6/11 doesn't count), but I still like it in principle. As far as I can tell, manipulation of algebraic expressions is one of the big roadblocks from jumping from highschool to college (at least where I live, which is not the US), much more than specifict topics like say trigonometric functions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Calculators are not the devil, but they can act like a clutch and not reinforce certain skills that are 100% necessary.

  "title": "CMV: You cannot compare the Titan Submarine accident with the Mediterranean ship accident.",
  "selftext": "I have seen people debating online about this and comparing one tragedy to another. For me, both are heart wrenching accidents, but it’s a two different discourse.\n\nMany stated their opinions, which are:\n\n*_“People are too focused on the submarines accident and forgetting the mediterranean ship accident”_*\n\nDo you know why people are talking about the submarine accident more than the Mediterranean boat accident? \n\nBecause one is a pure tragic accident, we can agree on that; and the another one is…some sort of darwin accident. \n\nWho wouldn’t talk about five rich people paying $250.000 to be shoved inside a metal coffin deep into the ocean? It’s stupid and also sad at the same times. It’s tickling our human nature on moral dilemmas. It confuses us, are we supposed to be sad? Or laughing? Everyone has their own opinion on this and every polar opinion seems to be valid. It is a debate.\nBut nobody is going to debate your opinion on the Mediterranean ship accident. We are deeply saddened by this and we are *supposed* to be sad. Anyone who says otherwise is a awful human being, but this sole reason makes the ship accident is not being talked about as much, because we already have consensus about this.\n\n*_“The rescue team to help the Mediterranean ship accident is inadequate compared to the rescue for submarine accident. It shows us that we care about the riches more than the poorer.”_*\n\nI couldn’t agree more on this, but this is not the only perspective. First of all, those five rich people in the submarine probably already paid a ton of money prior as an insurance to cover all the expenses to rescue them if accident happened. Meanwhile, the people on the boat accident probably didn’t.\n\nSecond, we, as a human being, would be more inclined to a weird anomaly cases rather than a case that happened more regularly. This is the reason why we take airplanes crash accidents more seriously than let’s say, a car accident, even though both cost us human lives.\nAnd coincidentally, a submarine accident doesn’t happen every year, hence this is an opportunity for the rescue team to put their rescuing equipment and protocols to the test. So we can see how far and sophisticated our technology to prevent this accident from occurring again in the future.\nMeanwhile, the boat accident has happened many times and we already grasped the boat accident rescue operation better than a submarine rescue operation.\n\nTo put into perspective, remember the Tham Luang Cave accident, when 13 boys in Thailand got trapped inside a cave for two weeks; and we all talked about this nonstop back then; and people from all over the world trying to rescue them, including all foreign military, even Elon Musk created a whole new robot to rescue them.\nDo we rescue them tirelessly because they are billionaires? No. We rescued them effortfully because it’s an unusual case, and we wanted to put our technology and protocols to the test while it happened since there’s no way we purposely shoved people into a cave, or into a crashing airplane, or into a sinking submarine; just to test our technology.\n\n\n(I don’t accept any opinion blaming the victims in the Mediterranean boat accident. We could have a whole another discourse about that but this is not the proper time and place)\n\nSome redditors pointed out that billionaires on submarine do not have insurance and they use the taxpayer money to rescue the submarine accidents, so my first point is wrong. \nHowever, this sole point is also the reason that makes this case is going to be talked more than the boat accident. The fact that they used taxpayers money to rescue something so stupid yet tragic yet pathetic.",

  "selftext": "The whole thing feels wrong to me, like its thinly veiled sexism.  I understand there can be \"male karens,\" but really the focus seems to be entirely on women.  It's a woman's name, and 99% of the videos I see on \"Karens\" are women.  Of the videos I see,\n\n* the vast majority are missing a lot of context that could explain the woman's actions to be reasonable.  The video starts halfway through her tantrum (not sure what the best word to use here is, but not meaning to be demeaning here) and some text appears on the screen explaining what lead up to the tantrum.  But how should we believe that is actually what started the incident?  Anyone can put some text on a video and claim what was going on.  For example: the woman (uber?) driver who supposedly throws out the passenger's belongings on the highway after being asked to drive under the speed limit.  Large portions of the video are cut out; anything could have happened in there that might make those actions more reasonable.\n\n* are reasonable.  Sometimes being inconvenient in public is justified if you have been wronged.  In a lot of the cases it feels like people just want people to \"suck it up\" rather than stand up for themself.  An example of this is the woman on the airline sticking up for her crew being treated poorly by a passenger.  Another example is the woman holding the parking spot.  The cars waiting for her to move should just keep driving and find an unclaimed parking spot.\n\n* are just someone being racist, in which case there is no need for a \"Karen\" label.\n\n* someone having a mental breakdown, which shouldn't be laughed at IMO.  (thinking of the cop freaking out about the mcdonalds order).\n\n* Are fake.  Thinking of the woman \"being attacked by a doberman.\"\n\nSo yeah, I think this fascination isn't really justified, and causes harm in targetedly portraying women in negative lighting.  It also sucks for anyone who happens to be named Karen.\n\n**What would change my view**\n\n* The \"karen\" videos I've seen are some compilation videos on youtube, and the occasional one that makes r/all when I happen to be browsing r/all.  Maybe there are some more justifiable \"karen\" videos I haven't seen?\n\n* Explain why one of my issues with the fascination isn't an issue.  Are none of the karen videos showing a reasonable woman?  Is laughing at someone having a mental breakdown okay?  Does applying the term \"karen\" to a racist do anything meaningful?\n\n* Explain or show that there is no harm being done to woman as a group or women named karen by this fascination.\n\n**Deltas**\n\n* The term originally started as a way to call out racist behavour that women were able to do due to societies view of them being innocent and vulnrable.  [This comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/13hfplv/cmv_i_cant_get_behind_the_internets_fascination/jk5opdy/) did a great job of IMO of explaining it and providing good information on the topic.\n\n* Its really hard to justify harming someone's items in most of these videos.  I still think it might be more reasonable than the video portrays if we are missing context, but not fully reasonable.\n\n* Standing in a parking spot to claim it is socially not allowed.\n\n* Men are criticized for being violent in public, ~~called \"popeyes\".~~ - nope, that was just the restaurant name.\n\n* Good has come out of the Karen phenomena.  It has brought light on racist behaviors.",

  "selftext": "I think that the title says it all. I honestly believe that birds are real and so please don't go there. Let me explain a little, back in 2020 I dated this person who was completely and utterly obsessed with birds. She also needed a new job and I would look up jobs on Indeed with the keyword 'bird' or 'bird watching'. \n\nAt the time I was residing in the DMV, and the aim was to find a job from Fish and Wildlife, Audubon, or something more broadly bird based from the Department of Interior. However, what I recall constantly showing up in my results was a volunteer based job from DARPA that requested knowledgeable birdwatchers. I had never heard of the birds-aren't-real conspiracy stuff and I never paid much attention to the idea beyond emitting a cold sigh of disbelief. This person I dated showed me the very real world of birds and we would drive around the tristate and go to different parks just to see the rare bird alerts in person through binoculars or on her x50 Canon scope. A bird up close is stunningly beautiful. \n\nMoving forward, the intersection of that DARPA job description and the laughter about the conspiracy theory made me extra curious what that job posting would have wanted by soliciting the help of bird watching experts who knew how to discern avian behavior. Knowing that iPhones can now charge on surfaces and that drone technology is accelerating like the curve of a hockey stick, it just kinda leaves me saying, wouldn't this be an excellent avenue to pursue for a department like DARPA?\n\nOne thing I learned is that birds and ducks weigh almost nothing. A good sized mallard weighs 5 lbs, a wood duck weighs 2 lbs, and a warbler would measure merely a couple ounces. The domain of these creatures exhibit behavior that is assumed to easily startled and they all fly away the moment a person or unpredictable animal get anywhere near their proximity. You truly need binoculars to examine birds as they are generally up in the trees or surrounded by a natural barrier of some sorts. \n\nAs someone who is studying computers and dabbling in robotics, please change my mind how this would not be an worthy avenue to pursue for covert or even domestic surveillance purposes. It seems that the military and intelligence agencies have developed toys for absolutely every scenario and this would surely have some use case somewhere. Finally, I have tried to find that job description but the only means I can think of is the way back machine and that doesnt work with something like Indeed's search feature. If anyone has an idea how to search Indeed then set your sights around October 2022, Washington DC.

  "selftext": "Status quo: I live in a really good university in China where the obsession on manners and \"not giving trouble to others\" is similar to that in Japan. \n\nPoint 1: It makes interpersonal relationships cold and tense. If you're not supposed to give trouble to others you don't have the chance to vent to your friends, or to seek help even if you need it. Because venting and recieving help, whether materially or emotionally is giving trouble to others and is often socially stigmatized. This makes people interact less and superficially with each other, there is barely any real friendship. It's harder to form emotional bonds because you aren't supposed to talk about deep stuff or help each other, instead everyone is encouraged to just mind their own business.\n\nPoint 2: It deepens the social stigma of mentally ill and neurodivergent people because of their weird, often socially \"inappropriate\" behaviour. I have bipolar 2 (taking meds for that) and probably Asperger's. Not only me, many mentally ill people fail to observe the manner of \"not giving trouble to others\". We need to be forgiven if we apologize and it didn't cause any real lasting harm. If such behaviour did cause real harm to others then we need to be punished, but if there is no such harm then we shouldn't be punished so heavily for breaking social manner codes, for reasons that are out of our control. Edit: Deleted the personal experience part in fear of doxxing. \n\nPoint 3: It discourages people who need help from seeking it, worsening many people's mental and physical illnesses. That's quite simple. Recieving help is discriminated against which makes many people keep their needs to themselves. \n\nPoint 4: There are no people giving out help without people recieving help. Discouraging seeking help and \"giving trouble to others\" is also indirectly discouraging offering help, because people who need help often hide it and are often too shy to accept help even if it's offered. As a result people who offer help and charity would feel frustrated and stop doing so.",

  "title": "CMV: All schools should have school uniforms.",
  "selftext": "By school, I refer to any educational institution where there is typically an educator, who educates the student in a classroom (not lecture) setting. Therefore, you can take this to apply to any institution before university (i.e. secondary school, junior college etc)\n\nThe reasoning for this is\n\n1. It promotes a sense of common identity, because you all wear the same dress, thus, you foster school camaderie.\n2. In public settings, it is far easier to identify troublemakers or students playing truant wearing the school uniform, and subsequently complain to the school or relevant authorities (particularly if a crime or misdenamour has been committed) in order to *identify* them and subsequently *rectify* behavior. I admit that this can be allievated by simply changing out of the uniform, however, to some extent it does provide an addition hurdle to such behaviour.\n3. Uniforms prevent, or at least alleviate, bullying and the class divide--it's far harder to bully someone for the uniform choice (while still possible) than for not wearing a branded shirt, for instance. This is made more prominent by the fact that one's shirt or pants etc is on a far more visible area and is hence a larger target for mockery. This could be extended to standardising shoe brands or banning branded shoes.\n\nLet's talk about common arguments against uniforms and standardised clothing\n\n1. Freedom of self expression: I should be able to wear what I like.\n2. Uniforms promote conformity and dissuade invididuality(an extension of point 1)\n\na) You can express yourself (which is a primarily artistic decission) outside of class, in your own free time. By definition, you are in school to learn, not express your inner artistic style/thoughts/anything like that.\n\nb)Conformity is not bad in and of itself. Let us assume that one of the primary goals of school is to prepare a student for the workplace/adult life. In adult life, you have to dress professionally at work--after a certain style, following a certain dress code. Even if you believe that this dress code is restrictive and should/will be abolished, if it *were* to be abolished, transitioning from a formal to informal dress code is far easier than the opposite.\n\n3. School uniforms are excessively costly. Due to this cost, nepotism/favouritism can occur where school uniform\n\nThis is actually the only legitamate argument I have heard of so far. let's analyse this on two tiers\n\na) This cost can and should be subsidised by the educational district--it is implausible that there are no financial aid schemes to help students with the cost of uniforms, books etc.\n\nb) It is not actually more costly to buy a school uniform, considering that 1) these clothes are likely to be worn over a long period of time--6 years for primary school, for instance--and therefore will be used to the fullest extent and 2) Assuming that there is no insane markup on school uniforms, which either the free market or governmental regulations should control for, there is no functional difference between buying a school uniform to wear to school and buying casual clothes to wear to school.\n\nLet's talk about nepotism and profits on school uniforms\n\na) Again, government control and whistleblowing: if the contract was not made public to all stakeholders and fairly considered, one can report it to the school.\n\n  \nb) If the level of governmental control is so low that you can't even enforce antitrust and antimonopoly laws, ensuring market fairness, then it is unlikely that the government would have the similar amount of control to implement mandatory school uniforms.\n\nc) School districts/cities/provinces etc can institute mass-bidding for a particular grouping of contracts to produce school uniforms, condensing it into 1 or 2 large contract biddings. Therefore, by the directive of the free market, if we accept the premise that every company will want to gain a contract (since it is profitable for them), then they will bid for it, driving prices down. If there is collusion to ensure only 1 guy (i.e. a friend/family of the mayor or whatever) gets the contract, these companies have an incentive to sue to 1) weaken rivals and 2) secure the profit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: mandatory school uniforms pls\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "Intro:\n\nGender identity is a big topic these days but with lots of conflicting ideas about rights and changeability of sexuality and gender. My point isn't so much about gender but more specifically about sexual attraction.\n\nPart of the lawmaking for homosexual rights has been based on the argument that these individuals have no choice or chance of change in regards to their attraction. They can either act out their attraction to the same gender or go celebate, not something that the government should demand of people.\n\nMore recently as the discussion has moved away from homosexuality and on to gender identity not primarily defined by sexual attraction my impression is that the claims have changed. And I think the science backs that up.\n\nMy view:\n\nI think that the brain is more plastic and changable than was claimed last century, that peoples attraction can change and is as much or more determined by cultural perception, personal experience, and gender identification than by inborn intincts. That means that it is possible for any individual to be bisexual, as long as the have the requisite experiences and mental changes.\n\nDoes that mean any homosexual can just change to be hetero? Not necessarily. We know it is really difficult to change many aspects of a person. There are many overweight people and addicted people that don't have their weight and addiction as identity factors that experience change to be impossible. I can understand that it may literally be impossible to a homosexual to change given their experiences and self identity.\n\nThat said I have heard many stories of individuals experience change in their sexual attraction, either from hetero to homo or vise versa, some \"naturally\" and others through dedicated \"effort.\" I understand that anecdotes are not the basis for claims on the whole population, but have not been able to find any statistical studies on the nature/nurture aspect of homosexuality and have trouble changing before I can be presented with those.\n\nDoes this mean we can outlaw homosexuality because it isn't perfectly unchangeable? No I think society has progressed away from outlawing things based on norms and bias. Do whatever you want as long as it doesn't hurt people.\n\nWould love to have my view changed, there is so much ideology and conflict around these topics it's hard to get to the biology of it all.",

  "selftext": "I think that splitting expenses in a marriage (specifically one where there isn’t 100% joined finances) should be done based on hours worked. \n\nI see the normal 50/50 split as having some major problems whenever there is a significant income difference between the husband and wife. If the wife is making 100k a year and the husband is making 40k a year, a 1k a month expenses will require over twice the amount of effort from the husband as it will the wife. \n\nThe usual way around this is to have the lower income earner decide on the level of expenses that they can live on and if the higher income earner wants to raise the quality(and therefore cost) of these expenses then they have to make up the difference. I don’t like this solution because it puts too much of the decision making power in the hands of just 1 person in the couple. Have 1 person be able to give and take away a huge amount of one’s quality of life seems ripe for abuse. \n\nIt also means that if the couple decides to only pay for the expenses that the lower earner can afford, there is not the same amount of effort being put into the joint expense. For a 1k a month expenses, someone making 50/hour would only have to put 10 hours of effort into the relationship whereas a lower earner making 15/hour would have to work for 33+hours. This just isn’t a fair way to treat a spouse.\n\nIn a budget that splits expenses by hours of effort this all becomes a none issue. If a 1k a month expenses has to be paid by the couple making 40/hour and 20/hour. Both would have to work 17-18 hours to pay for the expense and the total effort from each is the same. \n\nThis system can also be easily adjusted to account for hours spent taking care of the home/children/other needs to assure an even amount of effort is given. \n\nThe math formula for this would be something like:\nH=hours worked per person\nC=total cost\nR1=1st partner’s rate of pay\nR2=2nd partner’s rate of pay\n\n\nH = C / (R1+R2)\n\n\nEdit: I would like to specify this is primarily to protect the lower earner if a previously happy relationship turns sour. I do not believe this system would be the easiest for a healthy relationship but rather that is provides a certain level of protection if a healthy relationship were to become unhealthy. I do still think this system would work well in a healthy relationship but just not be as easy.\n\nEdit 2: This CMV is specifically ruling out fully joint accounts.

  "title": "CMV: It should be illegal for a publicly traded companies to ban a non-business customer for a single chargeback up to a certain amount of money, assuming some reforms are made to the chargeback system",
  "selftext": "There are many businesses that will ban customers from using their services if they engage in a chargeback. \n\nIt's important to understand the various reasons people dispute transactions.[Here's one source](https://www.clearlypayments.com/blog/chargeback-statistics-in-credit-card-processing/)  and [another](https://midigator.com/chargeback-report-statistics/). The majority of cases have to do with fraud, but I don't want this CMV to spend too much time on that, except to notice the second source is fairly emphatic that most merchants don't use good enough fraud prevention methods. We can obviously agree that customers deserve to not pay for fradulant purchases and that companies should do whatever they can to prevent fraud. \n\nI want to focus more on the cardholder dispute statistic. Basically, where you are not satisfied with a product/service and you want your money back. **First, I believe a chargeback should be summarily denied if the customer hasn't attempted to communicate with the merchant before disputing a purchase.** With that caveat out of the way, my argument is that customers deserve recourse in cases where a company is being unreasonable or is sticking to a return policy despite extrordinary circumstances.\n\nI've only done one chargeback. It had to do with Priceline not wanting to change a flight even though they were offering that flight as an option. The website had a bug or some special circumstances which prevented me from being able to just get a flight credit as per their policy. The customer service agents were all telling me it would be several hundred dollars more. I tried to escalate, but decided after two hours that it wasn't worth my time and I needed to charge it back. I disputed it and then booked the flight I wanted. I sent all of that to my card company with records of all of my chats and prevailed in the dispute. \n\nIt is absolutely possible for a company to prevail in chargebacks, and is far more successful if it has a robust customer service staff, detailed language, high-quality products, and a functional infrastructure. Companies that don't invest in those things open themselves up to more chargebacks. It's the same risk assessment dance that they do for everything else, but being able to ban people for chargebacks sidesteps it too easily. Think about it. If a company can win a dispute with the proper documentation, they're basically just choosing not to spend the time to have that documentation. The excuse for a lot of companies is that fighting chargebacks is more expensive than the actual lost revenue, which is another way of saying it's cheaper to pay chargebacks than invest in their infrastructure. \n\nBasically, every refund is given at the discrestion of a merchant. In the wide spectrum of refunds that get denied, on one end is an unreasonable Karen, in the middle is someone who got a customer service agent on a bad day, and on the other end is a legimate failure on behalf of a company. An unreasonable Karen would be habitual, which would get her banned from holding a credit card. Those other customers' only other recourse are chargebacks or lawsuits. Those chargebacks are powerful tools to keep companies in check, because in addition to losing revenue, they also may be banned from a credit card company for too many chargebacks.\n\nPS. There's a statistic you can find that 86% of chargebacks are fraud. This was data gathered by chargebacks 911, which is a service for businesses to fight chargebacks, based on a survey of merchants. It is not a reliable source of information. Also, I specifically mention publicly-traded companies in the title because I don't want someone bringing up their mom who sells soap on Etsy.

Black athletes typically have higher testosterone than other athletes. So while sports is meritocratic, It's not a perfectly level playing field. For example, on what could be an Onion headline, a cisgender woman was told she'd have to take medication to lower her naturally high testosterone. https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/07/two-cis-black-women-banned-olympics-natural-testosterone-levels/\n\nOf course, that's a slight advantage when compared to someone who is trans but didn't have years of puberty blockers or hormones. The Williams sisters, two of the greatest tennis players ever, were unable to beat a male player ranked around 100th in a 2 versus 1 match. I believe with sufficient hormone therapy / puberty blockers, a biological male could compete meaningfully against a biological female. \n\nAlthough MTF people can shrink a little in size, the statistical height advantage can't be erased. But their large frames are powered by less muscle mass. That's not to say that's a wash exactly.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/sport/61346517",

  "selftext": "There are two parts of my argument: 1) There is objective morality, 2) This is to maximise happiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI usually prefer the term \"Preference\" over \"Happiness\" because the latter fails to encorporate the wide variety and complex arrangement of positive and negative emotions, however I will use happiness for ease of other peoples understanding. To \"maximise happiness\" would be \"to bring into fruition the situation which an individual would say is their favourite if they got to experience and compare every potential outcome\", or in less pedantic terms: maximising happiness is someone creating their favourite life.\n\nI arrived at this view because if you go down to the core of moral judgements, all you're left at is \"Which is the most preferable option\" - so the goodness or badness of the Holocaust can be answered easily by \"Is it preferable the Holocaust happened rather than didn't happen\". This is a principle that even moral nihilists I discuss to resort to, when I ask them why they do X or have value Y the answer is akin to something like \"Because I like X and Y\", to prefer one thing to another at the very core suggests some subjective 'good' which comes from attaining said preference - and this is the core of what's good.\n\nOne key part I wish to make explicit about 'happiness maximisation'. Every person's happiness is equal, but that doesn't mean the manifestation of every individuals preference is equal. A Nazi who finds preference in exterminating the Jews is less worthwhile than a Jews preference is tolerance for everyone, because at the extreme the Nazi's preferences are limited in their manifestation of happiness becuase it necessarily relies on undermining anothers thus limiting overall happiness, whereas the Jews preference comes from enabling the happiness of others.",

So when people do go through these patches in their relationship when they start arguing, I think their decision to go straight to divorce is too fast.\n\n It’s not a healthy mindset to have because people need to learn to compromise in their differences and tolerate each other’s differing personalities. And they should first at least attempt to understand what is wrong in their relationship and try to fix it, whether through couples counseling or simply directly communicating and making compromises with your partner. Going straight to divorce loses any hope of bettering the relationship. And more often than not, the other side of divorce is not too bright. \n\nAdditionally, when a person makes a mistake in a relationship, you see all too often that the advice given to the partner is to ask for divorce straightaway. Of course, cheating is inexcusable but many other mistakes are simply too small to not be able to forgive. Couples need to be more forgiving of their partners and take that opportunity to grow together, instead of breaking everything off the moment disaster strikes. \n\nA relationship is a continuous cycles of ups and downs, and people resort to divorce during those downs way too rashly, Falsely expecting a relationship to be all ups and no downs.

This would be fine if this wasn't political, but it's pretty clear that the justices simply decide cases on political beliefs as opposed to actual facts. Only one justice currently seems to give any thought beyond political beliefs. \n\nFurthermore, a justice has recently been found of taking bribes essentially, which should've truly triggered some sort of action, but didn't because of the complex impeachment process. It requires a simple majority in Congress and then a 2/3 majority in the Senate.\n\nNow to go to further problems with this. The Senate is practically a useless house, but above that it's completely unfair because its principle isn't \"1 person, 1 vote.\" The states aren't different anymore, they're a country and don't all deserve an equal say because they're a \"state.\" They deserve the power their population actually has.  However, this flawed system means that either political side can essentially block impeachment due to how the Senate works. \n\nNext we can go to Congress. Gerrymandered districts create serious unfairness in Congress, due to purposeful but also natural gerrymandering. (natural referring to how democrats are concentrated in certain locations making bipartisan maps gerrymandered, too) Both political parties do it, although it does benefit Republicans that bit more.\n\nFinally the Presidential Office. Well despite Democrats winning the popular vote every time this century (Excluding a candidate who lost his original popular vote), they have only spent half of this century in that office. \n\nSo, in other words, every branch of the U.S. political system is seemingly flawed.\n\nCMV.

There are always never ending debates on whether one is superior to another. In my personal opinion however,  I'll never use PC for multiplayer gaming because of one simple reason: Cheating.\n\nMost cheat engines change client side information to cheat in multiplayer games. As long as the underlying OS allows custom scripts/applications to run that alters your input, there is virtually no way to stop cheaters from creating cheats in multiplayer games. A client side input is always gonna be compromised no matter how good of a server side detection they put out. \n\nThe best solution imo is consoles. Latest consoles haven't been fully jailbroken yet so cheaters are not able to add any custom scripts. Even if they get jailbroken, the system software needs to be updated to be able to play multiplayer. (You could say they can likely spoof the OS version but I doubt it is that easy). I know that there are cheats that gets installed in controllers but those are not as common and it's easier for console manufacturers to actually ban them. \n\nWith this in mind I've told myself I'll always stay with consoles. I know PCs are powerful when it comes to graphics and I might be missing out on them but I'd rather have a fair gaming experience. CMV if I'm wrong. \n\nTL;DR : Choose console if you don't want to run into cheaters.\n\n\n*Edit* A big oversight on my end is that I almost exclusively play FPS games and I was narrow sighted to consider FPS as the whole multiplayer scene.",

Look, as a certified freak my self, i endorse ***CONSENSUAL*** freaky behavior. But these freaks and creeps are getting rich while telling everyone else that we can't be consensually freaky, and i don't like that shit. These people preach abstinence and family values but can't even adhere to those ideals themselves. but this all shows us that these people use extremism to get rich.\n\nAt any rate, this new resurgance of these extremist beliefs like \"having sex is a sign of weakness\" is especially concerning to me given the rise in extremism because i watched a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv2iY8phBis&list=TLPQMTMwOTIwMjPjbwBcoEMMSA&index=84&ab_channel=Timeline-WorldHistoryDocumentaries) about hitler and his sex life and i see parallels between what he has publicly said about sex then and what's being said about it now. things like \"giving into lust is a sign of weakness.\" Even if it were true, is it *that* important for men to be strong all of the time? is it fair to expect that from men? personally, i don't think so.

While they make advance the goal of far-right, christian organizations to make us all live by their crazy views on sex and god, their politicians laugh on their way to the bank right before they go to the Super-Secret-Sex Club Dungeon of Debauchery and Pleasure. And the people at the center of all of this represent the same public ideals about sex that Hitler did.

  "selftext": "This is a controversial opinion that I would like to share, although I am afraid of being heavily criticized and cancelled. However, let's dive in:\n\nWith the rise of female sexual liberation and autonomy, there has been a greater normalization of casual sex, which benefits men as they're now able to increase their number of sexual partners without any emotional responsibility. Additionally, society still judges women harshly for doing the same, creating a double standard that benefits men. This reinforces the idea that men have a \"right\" to sex with women, and they expect it.\n\nThis leads to the objectification of women, where the media propagates the idea that women are sexually free, and this benefits men who consume this content the most. The more sexually liberated women become, the happier men are as they can exercise control and dominance, making women believe that they want it and turning them into \"objects of consumption\".\n\nIn conclusion, as a man who observes society, I have noticed that it is mostly men who push the narrative that women should liberate themselves and be sexually free. I started to wonder if there is something sinister behind this narrative, and after researching, I found that many feminists have already spoken about it.

Let me steelman the argument. Reparations advocates argue this is simply about their group being screwed over by the US government and that they would not oppose reparations for other groups, which have happened (though the benefit has been marginal). They argue that this is not an issue of guilting anyone alive today, but simply a debt that the US government owes to people who were once enslaved. However, some hold this as their #1 policy issue and will not support any politician/movement/organization that doesn't prioritize this controversial, divisive issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy issue with this is, as someone on the political left, I'm fucking sorry, but this thinking is horribly selfish and ridiculously counterintuitive. I do not argue with the notion that the US government does bear responsibility for their suffering. I *am* arguing that I find it a little silly to constantly view politics through the lens of some idealistic, storybook-esque mindset where the emphasis is on healing and righting the wrongs of the past and completing these narratives.\n\nHere's the reality: we are in a corrupt, broken society. We all know that. With corporate control over the media and politicians, We the People have very little political power and influence over how our society operates. It takes immense amounts of energy, dedication, time, and resources from millions of people to contribute to getting us even one step closer to solving any of the numerous problems we have to deal with. Even the most popular policy proposals which aim to universally help the population are so difficult to make a reality.\n\nPeople are *literally* dying because they have no healthcare. Children do not have adequate education and see their opportunities stifled and are then underpaid, worsening their quality of life. People caught for minor crimes such as non-violent drug offenders are rotting away in prisons, their lives completely going to waste while their families must survive without them. We have so many problems affecting so many different people. Let's all come together and focus on those issues to improve as many people's lives as possible.\n\nI find it a *hell of a lot easier* to convince so many people to agree with such arguments as those above. It's simple: people are getting screwed because of this system, let's do what we can to change it and help everyone. We don't need to divide us with all this talk about addressing the specific crimes done to a subset of the population and prioritize healing the group's past problems when those very people are suffering right *now*. Why don't we fight for Medicare-for-All? Why don't we fight for UBI? Why don't we fight for College-for-All? Why don't we fight for criminal justice reform? The problems I mentioned hurt ADOS the worst, and these examples of policy solutions help ADOS and non-ADOS alike in addressing the aformentioned problems.\n\nI don't understand, why must we focus on one group when we can benefit that group *and* everyone else. It's not like the US government hasn't screwed over people from every demographic simply because it profitted someone. Millions of people are owed something by the US government for one reason or another, but this mindset of putting the past front and center is only focused on one group, and I just find it odd and honestly, self-defeating.\n\nI'm open to hear all views and have a good discussion about this, assuming people are down to have it.\n\n&#x200B;",

Therefore I would like to hear more perspectives and understand more about why we do things the way we do.\n\n  \n\n\nSo the goal of politics is to manage the people and create policies that make their lives better. This requires knowledge of what policies \"work\" (based on some arbitrary metric or set of metrics). Currently though what policies \"work\" is not the focus of politics. When I see a political ad, listen to any political debate or engage in politics I do not typically see any evidence to prove that certain policies work. Typically the job of a political ad or debate is to one up the opposition and not to prove why their policies would work.\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, see \\[this debate\\](https://youtu.be/ZcrRUJk5O3Y) in the house of commons. This debate does not once provide any evidence that anything the prime minister is doing is actually improving ambulance wait times. Most of the key points in this argument are insults and attacking the opposition, either Kier attacking the way the current government is currently managing the ambulance service or Rishi attacking Kier. This means that when it comes to vote, it's not about what is actually most effective at improving the ambulance service waiting times but who one upped the other person the best. This is mirrored in many many political debates, obviously with some being completely about insulting the other party.\n\nTypically when it comes to choosing a political party to support it is not about who's policies actually work, it is about what \"values\" you align with. It doesn't matter if those \"values\" actually lead to a better life for the people or not.   \n\n\nThis means when it comes time to engage with politics I am stuck. One one hand I cannot find any solid evidence that any political party will actually:\n\n\\- Deliver on their policy\n\n\\- That the policy will actually work\n\nbut if I do not vote or spoil my vote, I end up being governed by the same political parties who do not base their policies on anything other than their own opinions. So I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. I have to make a best guess at what will \"work\" based on my own interpretation of various statistics, which is dubious as I am not an expert in any political field which means that politics at best will only give a dubious result. \n\nIdeally I'd like if politics was approcahed more like a science, using models and various peer reviewed studies to prove that policies can actually make a positive difference.

  "selftext": "I've thought this for awhile but haven't been able to find much serious, direct, discussion on the topic.\n\nBasically I think a lot of the dilemmas about what role the government should play in business could be effectively solved by getting rid of limited liability for investors when there has been some sort of social cost created. \n\nTake the moral hazard issue associated with bank failures for example. There is now a rock/hard place of:\n1. \"Bail out\" the bank and reward taking dumb risks with depositors' money, and also drawing capital away from responsible institutions.\n2. Ruin depositors who did nothing wrong other than not understand relatively obscure concepts like bank capital requirements because they were busy running a startup.\n\nIf equity investors did not have limited liability, then there would be no issue. Ultimately they should be on the hook for covering any shortfalls. The government could make depositors whole in a timely manner of course, but then could go after shareholders to get paid back.\n\nThis concept can be extended to things like the Norfolk Southern debacle as well.  This would be much more effective at discouraging bad corporate behavior than any regulation. Limited liability is just transferring risk away from those who are intentionally taking risk to people who were not supposed to be taking risk. It also forces investors to be much more rigorous in their diligence because their investments are exposed to losses orders of magnitude larger than their cost basis.\n\nManagement should have an offsetting exposure to any option-like compensation they receive in the form of an insurance policy they write against these sorts of liabilities.\n\nLastly, I explicitly excluded debt defaults from this, because losses on debt instruments are taken by lenders who intentionally taking risk and are compensated for that risk.\n\nI haven't seen this idea put forth in this specific way before so is there something important I'm missing here?",

  "selftext": "The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979(which I don't know why we call it this, when the Afghan government asked the soviets to come in) and the subsequent years of conflict have often been viewed as a catastrophic blunder by the Soviet Union, leading to dire consequences for the Afghan people, the region, and the world. What if the international community had allowed the Soviets to retain control of Afghanistan? Could it have resulted in a more stable, secular state like Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, or Kyrgyzstan, without the rise of extremist groups and the events of 9/11?\n\nOne of the central arguments in favor of this alternative scenario is the nature of the Afghan government that existed before the Soviet invasion. The Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, established after a coup in 1978, aimed to create a modern and secular state. The government implemented a series of progressive reforms, including equal educational opportunities for women, land redistribution, and efforts to reduce the influence of tribalism and religious extremism.\n\nHad the Soviets been allowed to maintain control, it is possible that these reforms could have continued, leading to a more secular, stable, and modernized Afghanistan. This could have served as a counterbalance to the rise of religious extremism that ultimately plagued the country.\n\n\n\nOne of the unintended consequences of the Soviet invasion was the empowerment of Afghan mujahideen, who received substantial support from the United States and other Western nations. These mujahideen groups later evolved into the Taliban, Al-Qaeda, and other extremist organizations.\n\nIn an alternative scenario where the Soviets had not been opposed, there might have been less incentive for the formation and growth of these radical groups. The absence of external support for the mujahideen could have discouraged the radicalization of Afghan society.\n\n\n\nThe Soviet Union had a vested interest in maintaining stability in its neighboring Central Asian states. Had they retained control over Afghanistan, they might have worked diligently to ensure stability and prevent the spread of radicalism throughout the region.\n\nIn this hypothetical situation, the Central Asian republics, which gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, might have faced fewer security challenges and less risk of radicalization. This could have had a positive impact on regional stability and international security.\n\n\n\nOne of the most tragic consequences of the Afghan conflict has been the erosion of women's rights in the country. Under the Taliban's rule, women faced severe restrictions and oppression. However, in the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, women enjoyed more rights and opportunities for education and employment.\n\nHad the Soviets retained control, these gains in women's rights might have continued, setting a precedent for gender equality in the region. The international community might have been more engaged in supporting these efforts, ultimately leading to a more positive outcome for Afghan women.\n\n\n\nArguably the most compelling argument for allowing the Soviets to keep Afghanistan is the potential prevention of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the subsequent War on Terror. Without the rise of Al-Qaeda and its safe haven in Afghanistan, the global landscape might have been markedly different.\n\nIn this alternate scenario, the absence of 9/11 could have led to reduced emphasis on military interventions in the Middle East and Central Asia. The immense human and financial costs of the War on Terror might have been averted or significantly minimized.",

If he's really that daunted about appearing publicly to discuss things that he's dedicated his career to researching, he can get a debate coach temporarily to help him.\n\n\\-Unlike Trump, RFK Jr. does not have a habit of blustering, bullying, and talking over people. To his credit, I have seen him take hard questions, and he listened and then responded. I don't think he would play dirty with Dr. Hotez, and even if he did, that would only expose him as a fraud to all but those who will stand by him no matter what.\n\n\\-No, Dr. Hotez should not give up his time and energy answering every random nutjob that comes out of the woodwork making crazy claims. That wouldn't be helpful either. But no matter how disagreeable his views are, RFK Jr. is not some random nutjob. There is $1.5 million lined up in support of this, he's running for president, and as a lawyer all these years, he's at least a professional in dealing with evidence and arguments about scientifically related topics, even if he has nowhere near the expertise Hotez does.

  "title": "CMV: Men are raped at similar rates as women",
  "selftext": "The reason that rape statistics portray men as far less likely to be raped than women (1 in 5 women vs 1 in 71 men) is due, first, to the way in which rape is defined, and second, to the rates of rape in the past. For the sake of this argument, I am using the 12 month prevalence of rape rather than lifetime prevelance. This is to avoid drawing conclusions on the current rates of rape based on data on the rate of rape in the past. I am arguing that today, men and women have similar chances of being raped. If we used lifetime prevelance, we would be including in the data on millions of rapes that happened decades ago when rape was far more prevalent.\n\nThe CDC defines rape as: \"Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration. Among women, rape includes vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object. Among men, rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.”\n\nFor some reason, they decided that a man being forced to penetrate is not rape. By the CDC's definition, a man can only be raped if he is forcibly penetrated. Being forced to penetrate is, however, classified as sexual violence victimization. I believe that we should classify rape for men and women as both rape and being forced to penetrate. \n\nBeing forced to penetrate is defined as: \"Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to, or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim's consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Among women, this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female's vagina or anus. Among men, being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in m ultiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one's own penis; orally penetrating a female's vagina or anus; anally penetrating a male or female; or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female. It also includes fem ale perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen.\"\n\nNow for 12 month prevelance rates as per the CDC \"Too few women reported being made to penetrate someone else to produce a reliable estimate and too few men reported being raped (per CDCs definition) to produce a reliable estimate. Because of this, I will assume these values are both similar in magnitude and basically cancel each other out. I could be wrong here, so feel free to share any information that disagrees with this point.\n\nWe are left with comparing 12 month prevalence of rape of women and 12 month prevalence of being forced to penetrate for men. These rates are exactly the same at 1.1% for each (1,270,000 women vs 1,267,00 men). This tells me that if men being forced to penetrate were classified as rape, which I believe it should be, that men and women are raped at exactly the same rate in today's society. \n\nWe can also look to the stats for 12 month prevalence of unwanted sexual contact. Unwanted sexual contact is defined as unwanted sexual experiences involving touch but not sexual penetration, such as being kissed in a sexual way, or having sexual body parts fondled or grabbed. While this may not be rape this would still be classified as sexual violence victimization. The 12 month prevalence for women is 2.2% and for men it is 2.3%. This to me is close enough but technically men experience this more (2,410,000 women and 2,565,000 men).\n\nThe data that I used for these statistics comes directly from a CDC study on sexual violence on pages 17-19:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_report2010-a.pdf\n\nSo yea, feel free to change my mind whether it is that men or women are raped more than the other.\n\nMy view was changed. There is newer data from 2017 that includes rape as I defined it here.",

  "selftext": "In a world where artificial wombs are not only cheap and accessible, but have the same invasiveness level as abortion, it is morally wrong to have an elective abortion if a man wants the child.\n\nRight now, both men and women can choose all kinds of contraception to avoid pregnancy, but when the conception has happened, only women can choose whether they want to become a parent or not. And it's fair, since the consequences of pregnancy lies on women. The most men can do is to be forced to pay child support to compensate for the dire consequences of a woman going through pregnancy.\n\nRight now, we have these cases:\n\n1. Woman wants the child, man does too = 〇 baby (favors both men and women)\n2. Woman wants the child, man doesn't = 〇 baby (favors only women)\n3. Woman doesn't want the child, man doesn't = × baby (favors both men and women)\n4. Woman doesn't want the child, man does = × baby (favors only women)\n\nNow, once it's possible to transfer the fetus to an artificial womb with the same invasiveness as abortions, the last option should change as such for it to become equal:\n\n1. Woman wants the child, man does too = 〇 baby (favors both men and women)\n2. Woman wants the child, man doesn't = 〇 baby (favors only women)\n3. Woman doesn't want the child, man doesn't = × baby (favors both men and women)\n4. **Woman doesn't want the child, man does = 〇 baby (favors only men)**\n\nIn this case, we've given men the same opportunity to choose if they want to become a parent of not without intercepting with woman's bodily autonomy.\n\nNow, we can either keep the same system and force women to pay child support just like men do, or demolish the child support system completely for both genders.

  "title": "CMV: Human civilization is justified in causing mass extinction and climate change",
  "selftext": "I believe that all the \"damage\" done to the Earth by human civilization up to this point is justified. There's a few points that, when considered together, lead me to this conclusion.\n\n1) First and most important: Humans are the only hope life has for surviving the destruction of Earth. There is a hard limit for the habitability of Earth. This limit will be reached in about one billion years when the sun expands and boils away all the oceans, leaving this planet incapable of supporting life. This will be the end of Earth-based life forever, unless it somehow escapes to another habitat. That's the MAXIMUM limit; there's several other things that could destroy Earth earlier, although they are unlikely.\n\nSo far, us humans are the only organisms that have left this planet. Think about it: Life started ~3.7 billion years ago. It's taken 3.7 BILLION years for life to develop to the point were any species is capable of getting off the planet. We only have 1 billion years left. *Life on this planet is 78% through its lifespan*. So although some might say 1 billion years is too far away to care, it's actually quite short in the scale of the universe and how long life has been around. If anything, life is like a student that procrastinated his final project until the last 3 weeks, except if he doesn't complete the project everything on Earth dies.\n\nWe must progress civilization to the point that we are capable of starting colonies off-world. This is extremely difficult, hence why no other species has managed to do it in the ~500 million years since complex animals first appeared. Humans are the only ones to ever approach that level of civilization. We still haven't reached it - we could be centuries or millenniums away still, if we make it that far. \n\nSo we've established that Earth has a relevant time-limit, and humans have shown the only capacity to save life as we know it.\n\n\n2) The damage caused to the environment in pursuit of the enhancement of human society is a temporary and unavoidable. \n\nI count human civilization are starting when agriculture was invented ~10,000 years ago. Before then, we lived more \"natural\" lifestyles of hunting and gathering like most other animals. Agriculture is when we started altering our environment to a much larger extent and in a way that some consider \"unnatural\". I don't believe it's any more unnatural than a beaver building a dam, or an ant colony farming aphids. Humans are just by far the best at it. \n\nA civilization that is simultaneously capable of spreading to new star systems and also causing no damage to the environment would be extraordinarily advanced. Certainly far, far more advanced that we are currently. I believe that we should strive to achieve this level of technology and society. This would essentially be utopia; at this point, there would be no risk of all of life becoming extinct, and humanity would live in perfect harmony with nature.\n\n\nHowever, it's impossible to reach this level without first progressing through our current stages. You can't go from hunters and gatherers to astronauts. You have to first build farms capable of sustaining large populations. You have to build cities and infrastructure. You have to create a system that incentivizes people to push technological progress. You have to attain a high level of scientific understanding of the universe. All of this comes from the hard labor and ingenuity of humans. It also requires an enormous amount of resources. \n\nEnvironmental activists may feel that humanity is poisoning the Earth with gas emissions, toxic chemicals, plastics, etc. It has also been claimed that we are currently in the middle of a mass extinction event, which I agree with. Again, my claim isn't that things things aren't happening; it's that humanity is justified in doing them. I think that climate change and pollution are serious issues and should be taken care of as soon as possible. \n\nBut we could not have gotten to this level of advancement without utilizing agriculture, changing our environment in extreme ways, or using hazardous chemicals. Oil and gas are not ideal, but once we reach our goal of 100% renewable energy (solar, geothermal, etc) we will be able to handle to situation. I don't see any way we could have skipped using oils/gasses in our civilizations development. It's not feasible to go from a pre-industrial society to being 100% renewable energy with no stepping stone. And by the time humanity even realized the harm that these things were doing, it was already integrated into every facet of society so our only realistic choice was to continue. So we cannot be blamed for using them as long as we realize it is only a stepping stone to something more sustainable.\n\n\nOne caveat: Wanton destruction/killing of the environment with no purpose is not justified since it doesn't serve towards civilization advancement. However, I think the vast majority of people already agree with this. Society as a whole does it's best to avoid useless destruction. On an individual level humans who start forest fires for fun, torture animals, or anything of the sort are obviously terrible and not justified. I don't think this invalidates my point because I'm speaking more towards society/civilization standards as a whole.\n\n\n3) We have no evidence any other species would do this better than us. If we *don't* eventually spread off-world, this will mean that we either just remained stagnant for the next billion years, and therefore die with everything else, or it can mean we went extinct and never got the chance. If we go extinct, the only hope for life is that some other species develops after us that can take life off-Earth. However, even if an intelligent enough species does evolve and accomplish this, there's no reason to believe they would be much better at this than us. We all start from scratch and learn as we go, mostly from trial-and-error. So wishing that humanity would die is not a solution because it may lead back to the same position, just with less time left. Essentially, humanity is not abnormally slow/destructive in our advancement of civilization. Therefore, since we have the most time to work with, we are the best choice.\n\nThese points will lead to the conclusion:  **(TL;DR)**\n\nHuman civilization is morally obligated to achieve a level of civilization capable of spreading to new star systems in order to save life as we know it. We are the best, and perhaps the only, species capable of doing so. Causing damage to the environment is an unavoidable, but ideally temporary, consequence of trying to achieve this goal. Therefore, human civilization is justified in doing so in the pursuit of our goal.\n\nEdit: I am also assuming that with technological advancements, we will be able to heal a lot of the damage we are currently doing. We will be able to control climate change, and hopefully have found sustainable energy sources that don't cause any harm. I don't think this is a huge assumption -  we're only a few centuries at most from this level of technology. Humans have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, so you have to be very pessimistic to think we won't last that long. Even if we blow ourselves back to the stone age it's only a few thousands year set back.\n\nEdit 2: Copying my response to a comment because I think it's relevant to this all:  I guess I just wanted to see if anyone would be able to change my mind whether the ends justify the means, since thats what my argument boils down to. I'm basically saying that all the death and destruction now are worth it, because the amount of future life that will be created is so much larger than that amount being negatively affected now.\n\nSo in order to change my view you would have to convince me my assumptions are unrealistic, and therefore our goal will not be accomplished and the destruction was for nothing.\n\nOr you could convince me that ends do not justify the means. In some cases I agree that ends don't justify the means, but since this is an end-of-the-world scenario, it would take a very strong argument to convince me of that.",

These groups are traditionalist conservatives, liberals, and leftists/Marxists. \n\nTraditionalist conservatives, in the US often Christian, like Rufo, Charlie Kirk, and others define \"woke\" most broadly, essentially encompassing anyone who has cultural or social positions opposed to \"tradtional Christian values.\" This is by far the least sophisticated and consistent definition, and often is just used as a boogeyman for things they don't like. Ross  Douhat at NYT has a [less religious version](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/opinion/woke-definition.html) of this formulation.\n \nLiberals who believe in individualism, equality, and merit, contrast their position with \"woke,\" which through CRT and other critical theories advocate breaking with *equality* to ensure *equity* for historically oppressed or marginalized groups of people. \n\nThe Marxist/leftist critique of \"wokeism\" is that by focusing on racial/sexual/identity differences, working class solidarity becomes broken and prevents either progress or revolution needed to improve the material conditions of the working class. They note that power centers such as government or business use the language of identity politics to maintain goodwill and avoid giving meaningful economic concessions. Freddie deBoer explains this perspective in [Of Course You Know What Woke Means](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/of-course-you-know-what-woke-means). Also see /r/stupidpol for the anti-identitarian Marxist perspective; it's sidebar has links to essays.\n\nThese three groups define \"woke\" somewhat differently and object to it for different reasons, yet they're generally referring to a similar grouping of people who hold similar positions on a number of issues. No one would deny \"socialist\" is describes a real thing just because Republicans regularly misuse and abuse the term.\n\n***\n\nObjections\n\n**\"Woke\" just means \"aware of systemic oppression\"**: yes, that's the original meaning, but words change. \n\n**\"Woke\" is a bad/dumb word for it**: also Freddie  deBoer: [Please Just Fucking Tell Me What Term I Am Allowed to Use for the Sweeping Social and Political Changes You Demand](https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/please-just-fucking-tell-me-what). \n\n**Bethany Mandel wrote a book about it but can't define it**. That interview was embarrassing, but one person or even many people using a word without being able to succinctly yet completely define it does not mean it's not a real category.\n\n***\n\nEdit: will be back in a few hours and I'll try to answer any substantive comments I haven't gotten to yet.

  "selftext": "I have struggled with mental health my whole life (untreated inattentive ADHD), which caused me to be ignorant, destructive, confused, susceptible to conspiracy theories, unwilling to change for the better, and it almost cost me my life, and potentially the lives of others!  \n\n\nBecause my parents and myself included, didn't receive any education about mental health. Even though our family was upper-middle-class, both parents finished highest education possible (in their time, in Yugoslavia), i went to an expensive alternative school, and they had the resources toget me diagnosed and treated at a psychiatrist.  \n\n\nWhy did my parents see psychology and mental illness as a hoax? And to decide that beating me is a better idea than taking me to a psychiatrist? Because in their time, there was literally 0 education on mental health, and mental illness was heavily stigmatized there, and was seen as weakness and as a disturbing topic for many people. Discipline was the usual answer for all problems.  \n\n\nCombine that with my parents' own mental health issues (which they obviously had because they were beating me and yelling at me often), and you get a vicious cycle of conflict, hatred, ignorance, confusion and misunderstanding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore of my personal story is at the bottom. But the reason why i'm mentioning this, is because i believe that there are hundreds of millions of people out there who are in the same or similar situation as i was in, and it feeds the vicious cycle of destruction, poverty, confusion, injustice and ignorance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that researching, managing, and educating people about mental health and trauma isn't one of our main priorities, to me that is just pure insanity, and to be honest, it terrifies me.  \n\n\nIt seems to lead to accelerated global mental health decline, self-destruction of our kind, and destruction of Earth's environment, since all of that is directly or indirectly caused by us, and not without reasons. Everything has a reason, and in my view, the reason is mental health issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople often love to focus and blame humanity's problems on corrupted, \"evil\", and greedy people, usually on politicians, influencers and businessmen who have bad intentions, and they DO cause most if not all major problems: Pollution, inequality, lack of rights, addictions, poverty, starvation, crimes, tortures, genocides, massacres, and other \"lovely\" results of our kind.  \n\n\n**But people rarely acknowledge that mental illness and trauma seem to be the ROOT CAUSE of previously mentioned \"corrupted, \"evil\", and greedy people\" that create all these problems. And that this situation WON'T significantly improve until we make research, management and education of mental health and trauma one of our main priorities, if not THE MAIN priority.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here an example of how mental health issues are destroying societies and families, for example ill take what's happening in the USA: How were Trump and his cronies able to deceive millions of people, and recruit them into MAGA/QANON cults? Why are these people so easily influenced by them? Why are all these people so susceptible to conspiracy theories, and why do they have such twisted perceptions on reality, all of which resulted in 6th of January attempt to overthrow the election?**\n\n**Is there ANY other logical explanation then mental illness, traumatic experiences, and lack of mental health support?  Surely there are more factors involved, but aren't these the main, root factors?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow of course, it is a problem that is probably impossible to fully solve, at least in the near future. But i truly believe that making it at least one of our main priorities, at least until we reach a certain balance, is the best path we can take.  \n\n\n**And it seems to me, that taking any other path would be like being on a ship that is slowly but steadily sinking because of holes in it, and completely focusing on throwing out the water, instead of plugging the holes and fixing the ship, which will at least significantly slow down the sinking, if not stopping it.**  \n\n\n**Don't get me wrong though. I'm not saying that we should ignore or neglect obvious other problems that we are facing, just increase the priority of the global mental health crisis, to strike hard on the root cause of the problem.**   \n**And of course that a lot of people need food, water, housing, and materials way more than mental health education/support!**  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for reading my opinion! Forgive me kindly if there are lots of grammar errors, my English is completely self taught, and I'm struggling a lot with focusing, especially when it comes to writing and reading, it took me many hours to write this. My replies might take a while.\n\n  \n\n\n**Here's an example from my life story in a nutshell:** I was born with inattentive ADHD, the symptoms were quite obvious since my early age. But my parents who had non-existent knowledge of mental health (and they finished really tough universities), never thought something was wrong with me, but that i was just being \"rebellious\".  \n\n\nAnd even after i couldn't keep up in regular school, and after transferring me to an alternative school, they STILL didn't take me to a psychiatrist, nor did the alternative school (that is supposed to specialize in kids with special needs) notice something was wrong with me, or maybe they didn't care.  \n\n\nAs i went through life, my untreated ADHD was having a feast on my mental health, and i became increasingly radical, frustrated and confused. Because i didn't know anything about psychology, and mental health was a myth to me, surrounded by stigma.  \n\n\nSo i was blaming my personality and myself, not knowing that it wasn't really my fault, and that it's not who i really am, or who i want to be. And this made me join with people who were similar to me, which of course resulted in even more decline of my mental health, and increased radicalization.  \n\n\nThen at certain point in my adult life, my mental health was crashing down rapidly, and i couldn't hold a job, i had severe addictions to substances ( 2 packs of cigs a day since i was 17 yo, is just one of many addictions i had), i've lost a lot of my teeth, lost my car, became a hooligan, and almost became homeless, heavily considering suicide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lack of mental health education in myself and my parents and other people around me, and the lack of mental health support from the government, was a ROOT CAUSE (along with ADHD of course) of my declining mental health and physical health, poverty, ignorance, paranoia, agony, susceptivity to conspiracy theories, radicalization, conflicts with people, almost becoming a criminal, homeless, and almost deciding to end my life.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The ONLY thing that saved my life and my mental health, is that at one point, i started to get increasingly curious about medical science, especially psychology.  So i started reading and educating myself about it, and that was the \"click\" that i needed to finally realize that my whole life was a lie, that i wasn't in control, and that i HAD to go visit a psychiatrist, hopefully get diagnosed and treated, if i didn't want to die or completely lose my sanity.**  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**All of this could have been prevented, if i had even some basic mental health education in schools. And i firmly believe, that this could be the case for hundreds of millions of people out there.**\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "I've used dating apps for a little but it's so draining for multiple reasons and this is one. Title maybe confusing so let me explain\n\nSo as a straight guy, I put my category as a guy and indicate that I want to see women. There have been times when I've considered changing my category to a woman, which would result in me seeing women who are attracted to other women. The reason I don't do this is because I feel like it's disrespectful kind of dismissing their sexuality in a way. Plus I feel like it's just rude because these people are trying to find a particular person who they have decided they are attracted to and you're like \"look at me!\" \n\nSo with this in mind I'm starting to notice an influx of this happening in various ways. One example, is a female, who identifies as a man and uses he/him pronouns...but still sets their profile as female. To me this is the same as a gay man setting their identification as a woman in order to try to match with straight men (which is also something that happens). \n\nThe second (and possibly more confusing thing) is people who set their preferences to men, but then say they aren't interested in men and basically come up with different ways to say they are looking for women or transmen, often using misandrist language. The latest one I saw was someone's bio who said \"Only interested in men who use she/her pronouns\".\n\nThis is one of many reasons I deleted the app but one I don't really understand. To me it seems this is very obviously disrespectful in the same way as a straight guy changing his preferences to swipe on lesbians. \n\nSo maybe someone can explain this to me and CMV",

She would dump Davey (1st born baby) on her husband and sneak out to steal Toblerones from and crash at the Inn. All Lorelai did was give her a not-stern-at-all talking-to. IN addition to that, when she was on bed rest, Luke was in charge of the Inn's kitchen. Sookie forced her cooks to sneak food so she could taste it, so she could torment Luke and make him do it *her* way, even having Jackson bully Luke by telling him \"let her do whatever she wants.\"\n3. Alec Baldwin posting a homophobic tweet against a gay reporter, George Stark, who reported on his wife, who was pregnant with their first of approx. 10,000 kids, that she was texting/tweeting during James Gandolfini's funeral. Pregnancy doesn't excuse you from proper funeral etiquette, bitch. And by \"bitch,\" it can refer to Hilaria or Alec.",

  "selftext": "I've seen a trend emerging recently where someone will express a sentiment like \"why should I use a plastic straw while celebrities are using private jets\" and then people will reply to that sentiment that in fact all consumer action is meaningless and big corporations are the major environmental polluters and carbon emitters anyway. And that it's not the consumers fault it's that the companies don't give consumers an environmentally conscious choice.\n\nI think that's nonsense. People often point out that Coca-Cola is the biggest plastic polluter out there, but for as long as I can remember they've always offered Coca-Cola in cans and glass bottles which not only similarly priced, but are also infinitely recyclable with negligible losses, and environmentally neutral when they break down to sand and rust respectively. Consumers choose plastic bottles because it's more convenient. But no, it's Coca-Cola's fault for not magically making something that has all of the benefits of plastic without any of its impact because it's a big corporation.\n\nPeople complain about sustainable fashion being unaffordable but every fast fashion outlet from Zara to H&M to fucking Walmart offers cotton or even organic cotton options but people have still made Shein and their plastic garbage clothing the biggest clothing manufacturer on earth. But no it's \"the big fast fashion chain's fault\" and \"I'm just one consumer I won't have an impact\"\n\nPeople complain about the environmental impact of aviation but choose to fly instead of going cross country by bus in America or rail in Europe. Because it's \"the aviation industry's fault\". Why would they want to burn more fuel on purpose? You could literally choose a more efficient transport method.\n\nThe same with protein. There's been vegan alternatives for ages and now there's even plant-based meat but it's still not good enough.\n\nI could go on and on.\n\nI just don't see how anyone who even pretends to be environmentally conscious can think that the environmental impact of modern life is caused by \"corporations polluting\" because they don't offer you something with all of the convenience and absolutely none of the cons. That's impossible. This argument is just a cop out to avoid making the most minor tiny lifestyle changes.\n\nI even considered that perhaps my economic viewpoint that consumption drives production is wrong, and that changing consuming habits won't change production. But even from the perspective of production driving consumption there are so many environmentally better alternatives to everything being produced and consumers still choose more harmful options because they are more convenient.\n\nTLDR: Blaming corporations for damaging the environment is just a way to make consumers feel less guilty. They chose to buy worse environmental products.",

So why not just keep them banned and avoid the trouble of having to deal with a big drug-influenced population? We don't have a big drug problem anyways. \n\nI live in China. I have never known anyone who consumes, possesses or sells illegal drugs in real life. The proportion of drug users in the worst drug-influenced province, Yunnan, is below 1%. According to the government, \"As of the end of 2021, there were 1.49 million registered drug users nationwide with a year-on-year decrease of 17.5%, 3.4 million people who didn't relapse for more than three years after withdrawal, an increase of 13.4% year-on-year\".

They seek a voluntary and painless way to erase life from this universe, whatever that means. \n\nThey also argue that most animals suffer and have no way to improve their conditions, due to instinct.\n\nTheir strongest argument is of moral consent, arguing that since nobody (or animals) can actually agree to their own creation, then by default we are immoral for creating them, because the moral \"default\" of consent is to do nothing when we cant obtain explicit consent from a subject.\n\nI think this is a very pessimistic and fatalistic view of life, it failed to mention that despite all the \"bad\" things they have listed, there are obviously enough \"good\" things left to incentivize and motivate most people to live. If life is truly hellish and most people are suffering without any hope of improvement, ever, till end of time, then sure, they may have an argument, but this is obviously not the case, right? Pretty sure we would know if earth is hell, right? lol\n\nAs for the animals, they live by their instinct, but not truly enslaved by it, because they too have preferences to live and if their environment is truly hell, they would either go extinct or stop reproducing, as evident by captive animals that refuse to eat and breed, they seem to prefer the wild, regardless of how \"brutal\" the wild is.\n\nLastly, for moral consent, how can you apply consent to people before birth? Is there a floating void entity before birth for consent to attach itself and this consent is violated when you yank this entity into a baby? How can consent be applied to both non entity and eventual entity at the same time, as if they are the same subject? This makes no sense.\n\nOk, maybe ALE subscribers can change my mind with better arguments, convince me that life is indeed not worth it and we should seek its erasure from this universe. lol\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "Here's why I don't think elections are rigged: If the majority of US citizens in every state voted for a candidate whose policies would hurt the ultra-wealthy \"ruling class\", there is nothing the ultra-wealthy \"ruling class\" could do to stop that person from being elected. They cannot manipulate the vote counts, they cannot cast one million ballots each. They would just have to accept the results and the policies that would follow. Unless somebody can show me that what I said above is somehow false, I don't see how elections could be considered \"rigged.\" \n\nIn the US, unlike countless other countries, elections are not rigged. And the sway of the ultra rich ruling class is questionable given how many people are against them and support policies that would harm them.. \n\nI think the problem is that a lot of people who want change *don't vote.* and don't try to get others to vote. Either because somebody told them elections are rigged (looking at you ultra left and ultra right wing) and the US is an oligarchy where the rich inevitably win, or because they believe their vote doesn't count so why bother. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think one vote changes the outcome of an election. But there are two conclusions that can be drawn from that fact. One, I shouldn't vote because my one vote won't make a difference. Two, I should try to get others to vote because just my vote won't make a difference. And far too many people stop at 1. \n\nI understand there are people who do not have the time to spare on voting campaigns, but there are plenty of people who do have time and just can't be bothered. And this, in my view, is the biggest problem with US elections: people don't put enough effort into elections. They say \"eh, the corporate stooge will just win why bother.\" And then the corporate stooge wins and they say \"see, why bother.\" \n\nAs for the voting laws argument- the vast vast vast majority of people are eligible to vote in the US. That's not to say there aren't restrictive discriminatory laws- I believe there are. But most of these laws do not actually prevent people from voting. \n\nIf people were promised free TVs for showing up at polling places, I believe they would find the time. Even if they are far. Even if they couldn't get snacks while in line. Even if any number of barriers were present. They're stupid rules, but most of the ones I've seen do not actually prevent people from voting. They just make it easier for people to say \"the system is against me why bother.\" \n\nIf the privileged citizens with time on their hands campaigned for the candidates they wanted and eligible citizens did everything in their power to ensure their vote made it into the pool, I believe they would be unstoppable. Citizens say \"my vote doesn't count why bother.\" Citizens tell other citizens that elections are rigged by the oligarchy. Citizens don't put in the time to vote and most of the people that could campaign can't be bothered. So based on that, I don't think the political system is to blame for the lack of change, I think US citizens are. But I'm open to changing my view.",

It’s realistic, in the job of being a jujutsu sorceror you’re not always going to come out alive, especially if you’re fighting special grades 9/10 you should be dead it’s a world consistency that I like, if we give other examples let’s look at Naruto: in the final arc of Naruto of the Main side cast o my one character dies, in what was a final battle arc only one character dies, it’s very childish in my opinion.\n\n2. It keeps a balance, usually in series like this you have the bad guys getting mostly wiped out, while the heroes remain relatively unscathed, and no I don’t want the bad guys to win. It keeps up the image that this is an actual conflict, it adds more stakes to the story and puts it in greater perspective what will happen if the good guys lose. It’s effective. \n\n3.

This isn't desirable if your goal is to adequately represent the preferences of the whole voting population. \n\nYou could argue that mandatory voting would fix this, and I'm not opposed to mandatory voting, but there are way too many separate elections in the United States. The [2023 Dallas mayoral election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Dallas_mayoral_election) was held on a random date in May and had *7%* turnout.

This can make us feel let down, upset, or even depressed when things don’t go the way we want them to.\n\n2.\t**Ignoring Other Feelings**: When we focus on being happy, we might forget that it’s normal to feel sad, angry, or scared sometimes. These feelings can teach us important things about ourselves and help us understand and care for others. If we only care about being happy, we might miss out on these valuable lessons.\n\n3.\t**Wanting More Stuff**: Sometimes, people think that being happy means having lots of things or always doing fun activities. This can lead to a cycle of constantly buying and wanting more, which can harm the environment and cause stress when we can’t afford everything we want.\n\n4.\t**Putting Ourselves First:** If we're always focused on our own happiness, we might forget about the people around us and the importance of working together.

  "selftext": "TL;DR - For moral opinions/beliefs, it is not immoral to 'force' your belief on others, as long as the belief itself is valid, and it is hypocritical to ask others not to 'force' their views on you without also adequately dismantling why their views are wrong.\n\nAs a vegan, I hear \"no one cares if you're vegan or not, just don't force your beliefs on others\". Recently, I realized that I don't believe most people actually feel this way. We all force our views on others literally everyday. Murder and rape of humans being illegal? That is the majority of society forcing the belief that rape and murder of humans are wrong and should be avoided onto those that don't. And this forcing of beliefs is done through force, or at least the threat of force. But I haven't heard anyone ever argue that the laws in place against the rape and murder of humans should be removed so that we don't 'force our morals/beliefs' on others. The entire foundation of a legal system is forcing certain beliefs onto everyone, or at least certain people. \n\nThe only time that people say 'don't force your morals/beliefs onto me' is when the topic at hand is something that they disagree with or when they don't want to change their behavior. In reality people should just say 'I disagree with your opinion on this, and here is why...' because pretending that we don't all force our beliefs onto people is absurd. People should say 'you shouldn't have that opinion or try to spread it to other people because...\".\n\nMost people have moral beliefs that go against what the majority of people around them believe. Trying to convince people of something is not inherently wrong, it just depends on the thing itself that is 'being forced'. Trying to 'force' people to not rape and murder humans is seen as good (as it should be). Trying to 'force' people to wear shoes that are too small for them would be an example of a bad thing to force on people, since it is harmful. These are just examples.\n\nSome caveats: \n\n1. This applies to moral opinions or beliefs. Trying to force someone to believe that orange juice taste better than apple juice is silly since that is purely a subjective thing. \n2. It depends what is meant by 'force'. Obviously in the case of the murder and rape of humans, force is used literally. Not every moral belief will be justified to use that. But usually when people say 'don't force your beliefs on me', it is just a debate or argument, not an actual use or threat of violence to behave a certain way. Saying that you believe something is morally right and that all or most people should do it is what I generally mean by force (aka having a moral opinion and trying to convince others of it).",

We’re going to have to spend billions of dollars in building/maintaining infrastructure and deploying assets and creating more icebreakers - its just going to be a lot and the US would be much better off spending all of this money in other sectors (healthcare, education, even funding other military operations). Right now we’re struggling with too less of a federal budget anyway (already hit debt ceiling) CLEARLY we cant afford to dump money in pointless causes\n\nAND IT IS pointless because\n2. There are no tangible economic benefits. People are saying the arctic is crucial for resource extraction esp. as they are seriously depleting rn, but as many studies have shown they arent exactly cost effective to use. in fact this is to the extent that every single arctic offshore project has been abandoned due to lack of feasibility\nThere is also a counter arg about trade routes. Since the arctic is on top of the world, its useful as trade routes can be formed from there, and if u control it you can ship things in shorter amt of times, get to other countries faster, etc. sure this is all great. except for the fact that the arctic ice isnt melting fast enough for this to be a viable option for a long time. Also these routes require specially built ships which shipping companies arent interested in investing in \n\n3. also decreases cooperation with russia. Much of Russia’s territory is in the arctic, so obv they will feel quite threatened if the us is suddenly sending a bunch of stuff over there. rn terms are already pretty bad between the two countries but there is always a chance things can improve(low atm but will be even lower if we follow this plan).  if the us starts making military advances right next to russia’s territory this will blow any chance of diplomatic relations out of the window. And this will lead to a huge decrease of cooperation in all sectors, including climate. rn russia and us both share mutual interest in mitigating the climate crisis but provoking russia in this way may be the very reason they refuse to cooperate which would mean very bad things for the world\n\nanother common arg is that us needs the arctic to maintain its hegemony, but first of all, hegemony isnt necessarily good. and arctic isnt worth it. as i explained w my previous points, we have virtually nothing to gain from the arctic but so much to lose, it could even cost the entire future of the world. so because of all of this i strongly oppose sending more troops to the arctic.

And their bodies also just generally have noticeably different angles, proportions, etc. Because of all that, I can definitely agree that the issue involving trans athletes is an important discussion to be had.\n\nI know a lot of people are upset about the unfairness of letting MtF athletes compete in female categories, but at the same time, what about sports competitions *isn’t* unfair? Some people are born with disabilities. Some people are born with rare, superhuman traits. Some people have better genetics. And what about cis women who just *naturally* have much denser bones and more testosterone than the average cis woman?\n\nThese are all unfair imbalances that we tolerate or just straight up ignore. The issue with trans people raises concerns about fairness, yes, but the truth is, that’s just the only kind of unfairness that people feel like they have control over. Also, sex is a preexisting method of separating humans, and that’s why people are comfortable using it, but (correct me if I’m wrong) I don’t think it’s true that that sex is the strongest predictor of athletic performance.\n\nBut the issue is, with the reasons I put forward, the logical conclusion would be that competitions as a whole are dumb and meaningless as they all involve some sort of unfair advantage that people can’t avoid. I’m not really pushing for that though, so it frustrates me to reach that conclusion.\n\nI’ve been able to find justification for contests like math contests where the goal it not so much to win fancy trophies, but to help the most qualified people rise to the top so that they’re more hirable and stuff, which I’d say is good-ish. While it might be unfair to the people who naturally have terrible memory that they’ll inevitably struggle in med school, nobody wants to be treated by a forgetful doctor.\n\nBut I simply can’t find a way to resolve this when it comes to sports competitions. I feel like they don’t serve any real purpose outside of being entertaining to watch, and giving people something to feel accomplished about. But neither of these are compelling arguments for why the system isn’t broken and meaningless. Someone please help me out here.",

  "selftext": "I was raised religious and in the church but with time and age sort of grew out of it. \n\nMy view is that Christianity started out as a very small sect of Jewish- Christians in 1st century Judea. A real man named Jesus preached about the end of the world and perhaps peace and love, and Roman oppression. The romans didn’t like this so they crucified him and he died. A few of his followers believed he would come back and continued preaching his message to fellow Jews. \n\nThen Paul comes into the picture and wants to start converting non jews. Soon the non jews became the majority in the Sect. Once Jesus’s earliest followers began to die off, someone using their name start writing down the gospels with information they received via Oral tradition. This oral tradition evolved like a game of telephone and extradionary and magical additions were added in order to recruit more followers.\n\nThe earliest Gospel, Mark, shows signs of this because it ends quite abruptly with simply a empty tomb and women running out in fear. Later Gospels added the stories about resurrections etc \n\nThe early Christians met in secret and had strange ceremonies. All very cultish. The Romans were religiously tolerant but the Christians meeting in secrets made them targets of persecution. It was most popular among slaves and women. Eventually it spread to Emperor Constantine, who made it the national religion. Then European colonization and immigration spread it all over the world. \n\nIf it wasn’t Christianity it would of been Islam or something else. Change my view!",

  "selftext": "In 1967, Israel fought a war with Egypt, Syria, and Jordan.  Israel shot first, but pro-Israel people defend it by saying that Egypt closed the Straits of Tiran, which they say is an act of war and justifies Israel’s actions under International Law.  I don’t think this is true, change my view.  \nFew reasons why:  \n\n* It’s not clear to me that closing the straits violated international law.  The straits are *not* international waters, they're the territorial waters of Egypt, and from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_passage_through_the_Suez_Canal_and_Straits_of_Tiran), the relevant treaty that would otherwise establish the right was not signed onto by Egypt (in part because of this very issue).  \n\n* Even if it was a violation of international law, it doesn't justify starting a war.  International law contains all sorts of treaties on mundane issues.  Someone violating a treaty on, say, copyright law doesn’t justify an attack.  The UN Charter says that you can only attack another country to defend against an “armed attack”, which this doesn’t sound like. \n \n* My understanding is that there are parts of international law that apply even to countries that don’t agree to them via treaty, but that’s usually really important issues like not doing war crimes or killing minorities … not the finer details of maritime law.  \n\n* FWIW Eisenhower [agreed](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/president-eisenhower-radio-address-on-the-situation-in-the-middle-east-february-1957) with me regarding the same issue in the 1956 war:\n\n> It has been suggested that United Nations actions against Israel should not be pressed because Egypt has in the past violated the Armistice Agreement and international law. It is true that both Egypt and Israel, prior to last October, engaged in reprisals in violation of the Armistice agreements. Egypt ignored the United Nations in exercising belligerent rights in relation to Israeli shipping in the Suez Canal and in the Gulf of Aqaba. However, such violations constitute no justification for the armed invasion of Egypt by Israel which the United Nations is now seeking to undo.  \n\nWhat would convince me is citation(s) to bona fide sources of international law saying that actions like this are illegal, and justify resort to war to rectify.  \nWhat wouldn’t convince me:  \n\n* Arguing about other parts of the Israeli/Arab conflict  \n\n* Arguing that Israel was justified even if it violated international law (a view that I think isn't totally crazy)  \n\n* Saying “closing the straits was an act of war/casus belli” without citing any source  \n\n* Saying that Israel *said* that it was an act of war (unless backed up by something saying that “what Israel considers an act of war” is relevant legally - doesn’t seem like it would be)  \n\nI should add that I’m not very wedded to a pro-Israeli or pro-Arab version of events.  This isn’t “Arab countries good, Israel bad, CMV.”  I’m posting this here in part because I genuinely don’t have a strong opinion either way.

  "title": "CMV: The EU should extend membership to North Africa and the Fertile Crescent if they can meet the necessary requirements to join",
  "selftext": "Basically what the title says. For most of history, “Europe” as a concept has been defined by the Roman Empire. Various states tried to claim themselves to be successors of it, and most states try to trace themselves back to it. The same is true of the states of the Levant, Mesopotamia, and North Africa. Yes, they are mostly Muslim, but besides that they’re far closer culturally to say Italy than they are to Pakistan or Indonesia or even a place like Saudi Arabia. \n\nThey also have deep trade connections to the EU, and make up half of the Mediterranean’s coastline. Economic migrants from these regions also make up the backbone of many European economies, and it’s in Europe’s best interest to stabilize these countries and help them grow economically. With the exception of Egypt and Turkey, they also all have populations less than existing EU members, so they wouldn’t alter the balance of power that much. \n\nOn the subject on immigration, the Sahara Desert is also a bunch more defensible border than the Mediterranean Sea, if you care about that. Culturally, many of these states once attempted to emulate European secularism, but failed, somewhat due to Europe closing them off and refusing cooperation or even harming them. I think opening those doors again and making it clear that the EU values these people would make democratic and secularizing reforms much more popular in the long run. \n\nI’m not saying that these countries should join tomorrow, far from it, just that they should be given that goal. States like Tunisia, Lebanon, and Israel would be a good place to start if expansion was considered (although again not at the current moment given their instability). I also think that encouraging cultural exchange through programs like EuroVision, NATO, and European sports leagues would be a good first step at improving relations. I think Europe as a cultural zone should end with the Zagros mountains, urals, Caspian Sea, Arabian desert, and Sahara desert, and I think as we move into a more globalized world, that will become clearer and clearer.",

  "selftext": "Edit: u/Phage0070 did a good job. I'm convinced that this movie may be evil. A great point some users picked up on was this:\n\n1. POC of girl is subservient to a white patriarch. White abusive love interests who she changes herself to appeal to rather than love herself. Her mother is gone and her father is a hispanic white passing male. This all perpetuates the white male patriarchs. \n\n2. Asian women as one of the main casts and other POC of women. But lack of black and Asian men. Asian men are typically invisible in American white media, but blatantly so in this movie. Black men are typically portrayed as funny tropes similar to Asian men but zero to be seen. Except Sebastian who is played by Daveed Diggs. \n\n3. Potential male romance role is once again a white male. While black, asian, and other POC of males are shafted. No black Eric. This could reinforce white patriarchy and white male worshipping while POC males are shafted, either played as joke roles or not at all\n\n\nMovie is very concerning now. May have to really reconsider my position and view. Hopefully the movie doesn't perpetuate white male worshipping and white patriarch. Shame disney.\n\n[ORIGINAL POST]\n\nWorking with children in a very diverse area. It's nice to see better representation for children of color. Ariel is a good step in the right direction, it's not about us old timers anymore, it's about the children. \n\n\n\nThink about it like this, while it's nice to see white men in there 30s heavily concerned about the race of a mermaids in a children's movie. Growing up, it's always this:\n\nWhite man saves the day, is the hero, is the main character. \n\nWhite female is the princess, the main character, sometimes hero, center of attention, is the main character. \n\nBut we hardly see much positive representation of people of color, only recently changes have been made, but with a lot of push back. \n\nBlack men? Often times portrayed as male thugs, gangsters, needing a white savior, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Black women portrayed loud and obnoxious.\n\nAsian men? Weak, feminine, thugs, or smart but expendable resources, never a male lead role who kisses a white women or a person of color, this is taboo in America. Asian women are made to hate the Asian men and worship a white man, while hating and denouncing Asian heritage and culture.\n\nThese things propagate into our real world through in a sense manipulation and have extremely negative consequences. \n\nSo I'm happy for this movement for better representation. Is it perfect? Nope. But I'm optimistic and think our kids will have a bettee time with more relateable and positive role models through the media.",

In fact, so much so that it has become a bit of a comedy genera. Just type SJW into YouTube and you'll see many of examples passionate activists not being able to respond to simple questions about their own claims.\n\n**I am not claiming:**\n\n1. That all activism is bad or irrational (I think sometimes it is very important).\n2. That the activists need to know EVERYTHING about their topic and be able to answer every question.\n\n**I am claiming:**\n\n1. There are many activists who can't answer basic questions with anything more than an oversimplified slogan.\n2. Have not thought about their message - at all.\n3. Need to be able to formulate a reasonable argument defending the basics of their position BEFORE telling everyone else to change the way they see and live in the world.\n\nAgain, I am not trying to paint *all* activists as irrational or wrong. However, there is good reason to believe there are a lot of irrational activists who have not done the cognitive work required to claim any authority on the matter they preach.\n\nI will try to upvote and reply to all respectful comments - even if I don't agree. But if I don't get the chance thank you for your input. I will at least try to read them all.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you for all the input. I got a lot from it and it made me think I have definitely modified my view (although I haven't completely changed it) after engaging with everyone here. I think the sources I used exaggerate the number of irrational activists. I also recognize that often activists may have thought about their topic but may lack the communication skills to effectively communicate their position when put on the spot. So although I still think there are a significant amount of irrational activists there are probably a lot less than I initially thought. But there are still enough of them for me to encounter at work, in college, and to compile thousands of videos on - so there still is enough of them in my opinion.\n\nI also see that putting too much thought into something can inhibit action. At some point, you just need to act. You can't wait to have all the answers. But if you put no thought into it then it may be a case of the blind leading the blind which I still think happens - just maybe not as much as I originally thought. There have been extreme groups in the past (on the left and right) who have led people over the cliff into disaster. \n\nSo thanks again for helping me to think about this issue. \n\nAnd thank you to all thoughtful activists for your work :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

  "selftext": "If you are born with nicer genes, good family upbringing, culture that values kindness and helping others, smart and talented at things that will earn a good living, born into a safe and stable country -- it gets man a lot easier to be a \"nice person\".

I actually believe with time it'll be more understood how much qualities like kindness are actually genetic tendencies some trend towards while others trend towards being meaner. At that point how much of anyone being good or a nice person is just random luck?\n\nIn light of that understanding I do strongly believe in social welfare programs because it truly just may not be possible for some people to be \"integrated\" and \"functional\" even if they seemingly have the cognitive capacity -- they may just need living stipends and being given homes otherwise you will have things getting worse and worse. I don't know if everyone in prisons can be rehabilitated to being friendly and great parts of society unless they receive lots of help and continued help even outside prison. I think lots of crime would be easily addressed by simply accepting goodness is largely luck. Loads of people would not be committing crimes right now if they had medical care, places to live, food stipends -- it would resolve a lot of issues to simply accept a ton of who people are is pure luck which means telling people, just pick yourself up by the bootstraps is not meaningful advice.

For example, when someone has anger issues, it would mean that you should neither date them nor be friends with them. It's not just a preference or incompatibility. It's an issue that can end badly when starting a relationship or a friendship.\n\nBack to my view. I think that having red flags isn't the end of the world. Why? Because red flags could be applied differently. For example, if you are love bombing, then you shouldn't date or have friends, but you can still communicate with your work partners. If you are physically aggressive, then you can't be in physical contact with people, but you can still communicate online because you are not aggressive when you are talking online.

  "title": "CMV: Rule by educated citizens selected by lottery would be preferable to a democratic republic.",
  "selftext": "***This is gonna be pretty long; TLDR below.***\n\nBefore I say anything else, I want to clarify that **this is NOT a post in defense of fascism or any other form of despotism.** The very inspiration for my belief is the threat reactionary ideologies pose to nations around the world. However, I do have several other reasons, which I will elaborate here.\n\nI also understand that all of my criticisms of uninformed voters, confirmation bias, etc. extend to myself as well. I learned many new things just researching for this post.\n\nTo put a finer point on it, \"rule by educated citizens selected by lottery\" means pretty much what it sounds like: citizens interested in public office must pass a test covering the basics of the country's political system, and those who pass are selected at random every four/five years to serve in the legislature. (In my version, those selected would serve only a single term.)\n\nThe titular name for this system is obviously quite long, so going forward I will call it *lottocratic epistocracy* or *LE*.\n\nWhy I think this:\n\n1. A lottocratic legislature would be **more likely to implement policies which actually benefit everyday people,** since it would be *composed* of everyday people.\n\n2. Such a legislature would also have no need for campaign contributions — there would be no elections, after all — and would therefore be **less susceptible to corruption or bribes** and more likely to pass regulations against itself.\n\n(A quick footnote: I don't believe that, say, the President of the United States should not be selected randomly. I would only suggest sortition for large multi-member bodies. Perhaps the President could still be popularly elected, or instead be elected indirectly by the lottocratic Congress.)\n\n3. Democracy is sometimes defended on the grounds that all persons should have a say in how they are governed. I can sympathize with this view. **However, I would argue that democracy is much more about exercising power over how** ***others*** **are governed.**\n\n4. **Huge numbers of voters are uninformed/misinformed.** The results of elections and referenda have real, measurable consequences, and not just anyone should be given the power to influence those consequences.\n\n[For example:](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2019/09/24/how-little-we-know-reflections-on-our-ignorance-of-the-eu/)\n> 72% of Leave voters and 50% of Remain voters endorsed the statement that “More than ten per cent of British government spending goes to the EU.” [...] According to the Europa.eu website, the correct figure [in 2019 was] 0.28%.  So the majority of people think that we [sent] the EU at least 36 times more money than [was] the case.\n\nFast forward to the present day, and inflation in the UK is the worst of any G7 country, thanks in part to the economic barriers imposed by Brexit. ([source A](https://www.statista.com/chart/30398/inflation-rates-in-g7-countries/)/[source B](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jun/22/brexit-is-making-cost-of-living-crisis-worse-new-study-claims))\n\n5. **Uninformed voters are everywhere.** For example, [much of the EU remains hostile to immigrants](https://news.gallup.com/poll/320678/world-grows-less-accepting-migrants.aspx) when multiple studies have shown that no reliable connection exists between European immigration and violent crime or unemployment. ([source A](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/20635-eu-research-disproves-link-between-immigration-and-increased-crime)/[source B](https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/library-document/crime-and-immigration-evidence-large-immigrant-waves_en))\n\n6. **Uninformed/misinformed people actively resist correct information.** Some may argue that expansion of access to information and education would help to combat voter ignorance. I agree that it would and it does, some. But the grim reality is that we *all* suffer from some level of confirmation bias — though this is especially true for the most divisive issues *and of the most misinformed people,* the latter of which are often [unwilling to even consider viewpoints which conflict with what they already believe](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/06/study-finds-political-bias-skews-perceptions-of-verifiable-fact/). Reliable information is more easily accessible now than at any other time in human history, yet we still have to have debates with people over verifiable facts such as [vaccine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-02185-4) [efficacy](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/02/09/heres-how-many-americans-are-actually-anti-vaxxers/) and [evolution](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/02/11/darwin-day/).\n\n**\"But how would you design a fair test?\"**\n\nThis is the most common argument against requiring a test to vote that I have personally encountered. It's a fair question.\n\nIn the same way that most citizens of democratic republics trust the state to administer tests and licenses for people to drive or own firearms (in most places), I think we could broadly trust a lottocratic state to administer a fair test on politics.\n\nFor example, imagine the first lottocratic US Congress were mostly belligerent racists, and sought to design a Jim Crow style literacy test with the aim of disenfranchising Black people. Even so, it would probably have little or no effect on the demographic composition of Congress, since representatives are otherwise selected at random; you're therefore basically guaranteed 14% or so of them will be Black (especially if [stratified sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratified_sampling) is used). Under this system, such a biased test would probably be quickly undone by later sessions of Congress.\n\nIdeally, the test would be designed in collaboration with people formally educated in political science and/or on the politics of their specific country.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n**We tend to think of a vote as an expression of self, rather than the exercise of power over others. The elections those votes are cast in often give power to demagogues who ignore the public good and seek only to line their own pockets. This is made all too easy by our electorate(s), wrought with people who are not only misinformed but actively resist information which would help them understand things as they actually are.**\n\n***I would like to believe that democracy isn't beyond saving.*** **But for now, my view is this: political power should be exercised with careful thought, and democratic systems encourage anything but. We would therefore be better off ruled by educated citizens selected by lottery.**\n\nThanks to everyone and anyone who read all this. I look forward to your responses.\n\nEdit: Tried to fix list formatting to no avail\n\n**Edit 2: Haven't been able to post this the first few tries, so I'll try to condense it: my view has indeed been changed! I still think sortition may have a place in public policy, but it should be done carefully and with accountability in mind. A test to vote, however, is not worth the risk of concentrating even more power into the hands of bureaucrats and lobbyists.**",

  "title": "CMV: Drag is akin to black face",
  "selftext": "First let me preface this with : I’m a woman and 70% of my entertainment is drag race, drag Youtube Channels, drag related subs on Reddit...It’s been that way for years now. I also label myself a feminist and from the left. I also don’t care if kids are seeing drag queen at the library. With all that info you can guess my general value system. \n\nI don’t know if you’ve seen the recent Jimbo debacle . Jimbo is a drag queen whose currently getting pushback for the way she portrayed women via his artistic choices.\n\n\nI did not follow this particular story up close, but saw some arguments online that got me thinking. Here’s the idea that emerged in my head.\n\nDrag can be considered akin to black face/cultural appropriation. \n\nHere is my definition of appropriation:\n\nGroup A, who in a position of power regarding Group B, is using key components of group B’s identity. \n\nIn some cases the appropriation hurts group B via mockery because group B endures discrimination for displaying historically those signifiers.\nFor example: black face (darker skin and racism) or making fun of east asian face features, wearing natives ceremonial apparel as halloween costume, etc. \n\nIn other cases group A adopts/steal ls the cultural signifier to use it as its own. I used adopting/stealing here because depending on the case, members of group B can react positively or negatively. Example: white people wearing dreads, adopting ghetto or queer language, jazz and rap, wearing kimonos, eating sushi, etc. I’m thinking of cases like that one kid of wore a Moana costume for Halloween that sparked the debate: is it appropriation or appreciation?\n\nNow, if I apply those ideas about drag. \n\nAt the baseline, drag comes from men portraying women using signifiers that women historically have been belittled for (Makeup, clothing, sparkling everything, pink extravaganza). And drag is for entertainment, so it’s not men starting to wear glittery dresses day to day as a form of appreciation for dresses. It’s to make a show.  Like comedian stretching their eyes with tape to mimic asian features to get a laugh. The latter is frowned upon but not drag?\n\nIf drag is showing appreciation of women features, why some languages in drag sounds derogatory toward women ? One example that has been brought up in Drag Race itself is that the word  “fishy” is being used to say someone looks so much like a women that he begins to smell like them. Associating fish smell and women does not sound celebratory. \n\n\nNow reflecting on the thoughts I just wrote. Can some drag be hurtful to women ? Jimbo got a lot of flack for , like some say, portraying women in a hurtful manner. While others say it’s just comedy and camp. Aren’t those arguments used for blackface defenders? \nJimbo replied with something along the lines of: I respect and love my mother, sisters, aunt. Isn’t that a response akin to “but I have black friends, I can’t be racist “\n\n\nAnd finally, as a drag entertainment enjoyer myself, I can see that a lot of drag queens celebrate and show appreciation to the feminine realm. Does that make drag immune to feminist criticism ? Am I partaking in and enjoying something that is historically and inherently sexist ?\n\nAnd if drag is acceptable, would there be a context where blackface or yellowface would be acceptable.

  "title": "CMV: The War on Plastic is a Mistake",
  "selftext": "In the last decade or so plastic (especially in single-use products) has become the subject of a moral panic that is unjustified and foolish. Think for example of the successful campaigns to replace plastic straws with paper ones, or to ban or tax plastic bags and fastfood packaging. \n\nOf course the production, use, and disposal of plastic products does cause harms to people, animals, and the wider environment. But everything causes harms when 8 billion people do it. The significant thing is that using plastics for these purposes causes far less of these harms than anything else would. e.g. an organic cotton tote bag has a hugely greater environmental impact compared to a single-use plastic shopping bag ([link](https://qz.com/1585027/when-it-comes-to-climate-change-cotton-totes-might-be-worse-than-plastic)). Likewise, plastic packaging of food, e.g. meat, reduces food waste and hence reduces the total environmental impact of food production. \n\nMost of the criticisms of plastics focus on its disposal. e.g. because it doesn't break down quickly and is hard to recycle it persists 'in the environment' - e.g. causing unsightly garbage patches in the oceans, and killing animals in a particularly horrible way. But the problems plastics cause to the environment are really caused by inadequacies in countries' waste disposal systems, rather than the long-life of plastics. If you live in a first world country and put your plastic straw in a garbage bin after using it, then you can be pretty certain it will go to a landfill or incinerator and not end up washed into a river and hence to the ocean where a dolphin will choke on it. (And we are not going to run out of room for landfills.) Other risks commonly cited seem the product of the moral panic rather than a justifiable cause for it, such as the so far evidence-free claims about the dangers of 'micro-plastics' ([link](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/microplastics-human-body-know-dont-know-rcna23331)).\n\nOf course humanity should try to improve the way we make, use, and dispose of plastics (e.g. researching and improving the safety of different kinds of different chemicals used in them; creating shorter-life plastics; helping poorer countries improve their waste-management systems; etc). But it is a huge mistake to see plastics themselves as an enemy of the environment that we are locked in some kind of moralistic struggle against (like cancer). The war on plastic is a huge political distraction from addressing actually significant environmental challenges, such as climate change. And even if it were achieved, a world with without plastic would be a much worse world than we have now, for both humans and the environment. \n\n&#x200B;",

Where did we get this notion that humans are naturally monogamous? Why do some societies believe that their god created them to be monogamous. There's no evidence to suggest everyone is monogamous. \n\nI'm not arguing no natural monogamous people exist but that humanity as a whole, not every human will feel most comfortable monogamous",

  "selftext": "The argument that the Soviet Union wasn't genuinely socialist boils down to a pretty clear distinction between socialist ideals and the way things actually played out.\n\nWhile socialism traditionally advocates for collective ownership of the means of production, the Soviet Union under especially under Stalin exhibited a top-down, authoritarian control over the economy and society. State ownership of the means of production did not translate into genuine worker control or empowerment in a meaningful enough way to count as Socialism, as decision-making was concentrated in the hands of a bureaucratic elite. The absence of true worker self-management and the suppression of dissenting voices demonstrate a departure from the core principles of socialism. Additionally, the existence of a privileged political class, stark economic inequality, and a lack of meaningful democratic processes in the Soviet system underscore how the Soviet Union deviated from the ideals of socialism, portraying it as a state-capitalist entity if anything rather than a truly socialist society.\n\nEDIT: Here, i'll summerize what i'm asking, Do you think that the Soviet Union, during a point it's time, Meaningfully applied the socialist principles (which I would say is worker control and Collective Ownership) that Socialists are wanting to apply today? Or Maybe do you think they had an asperation to that, due to outside interference or internal Corruption, they were never able to?",

  "title": "CMV: watching porn should not be normalized within committed sexual relationships",
  "selftext": "Lately I see so many reddit posts from wives complaining that their husbands watch porn and that it bothers them. Most of the responses would be like, \"its none of your business what your husband does\", \"its his body he can jerk off whenever and however he wants\", \"your'e just insecure, go see a therapist\", etc. But I feel this is wrong on so many levels. This practice has become so normalized that women don't questions this anymore, it's something that they have come to accept as part of life, as if  all males behave that way and that it is inevitable, so they are stuck with these conflicting emotions not knowing how to process them.\n\nRegardless of whether porn is a form of cheating or not, I think this practice should not be normalized within committed sexual relationships, for the reasons below:\n\n1. It's simply not true that all men need to watch porn. If you wanna make the argument that all men need to jerk off every once a while that's one thing. But to say that watching porn is a necessity is simply a lie. Plenty of my friends do not watch porn but have healthy sex lives instead.\n2. There's a difference between jerking off and watching porn. I find that ppl conflate these two, its like if he can't watch porn then you're not letting him release his sexual energy and you're hindering him and his natural urges. But that's another lie. There are plenty of ways for men to jerk off without resorting to porn. Porn is just a heightened form of imagination and fantasy, men masturbated for thousands of years before the advent of porn and they did just fine. It's just not a necessity.\n3. This is really my main argument. **Watching porn in most cases will hinders one's sex life with their spouse.** I know this to be the case as I experienced this firsthand. First off, porn addiction is a real thing and it can ruin one's sex life, but that may be an extreme case; even if someone is not actually addicted to porn, it undoubtedely affects one's sex life whether they are aware of it or not. Men lie to themselves that they are just not in the mood of sex, or that they are simply too tired to do it, but the truth if they wouldn't be watching porn they would be having sex much more often. Not the same argument can be made in regards to masturbation. Masturbation on the most part does not hinder one's active sex life, because it is a completely different experience, and is usually used in addition to sex. But porn, besides for the unhealthy expectations it sets, is a lot of times used as a substitute for sex. Yes I know, sex with the same person can get boring at times, but instead of focusing on making things better and spicier in the bedroom, its just easier for men to jerk off to their fantasy hottie, so its the easy way out, but not necessarily the most effective and most healthy way for men to cope with their sexual energy. I may be overgeneralizing here, but I know that this is true for so many men. And [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1988.tb00027.x) seems to back this up.\n\nI'm not arguing that porn should be banned, I'm just saying that porn shouldn't be normalized to the point that all women must accept the fact that men need to be able to watch porn. Let's be true to ourselves, porn has a lot of negatives and its not something men NEED (they WANT it alright, but they also want to cheat and hang out in strip clubs), and it's ok for women not to be ok with their men jerking off to porn. This has nothing to do with them owning their husbands body. If porn is affecting their sex life (and I think it does) then I think they should have every right to make resonable demands and set normal healthy boundaries on what is or isn't allowed in a committed sexual relationship.\n\nEdit for clarity: my first two points are not that since porn is not a need then men should be ok without it. My point is that men use statements like those to maipulate women to make porn more acceptable and normalized, they compare it to masturbation as if to say, that if you don't let me watch porn then youre not letting me be a healthy functioning male, which is simply not the case. There's a chasm between the two.",

The idea that a university degree is similar to a vocational education is an idea perpetuated by many high schools across the country. \n\nYes, a university degree can absolutely help you get a better job. However, the main goal is to educate you in a field and often to prepare you for further research and education. The correlation between education attainment and income is clear to any economist, yet, if you break it down by field this varies greatly.

Soooo... When this happened, I was not aware of how cruel people are capable of being for the stupidest of reasons, since I had been very reclusive.

Needless to say, I don't answer that question like that anymore.\n\nLater, my parents were trying to get me a therapist, and asked me which of the available ones I preferred. The problem was that they had asked about \"Autism therapists\", when there were therapists specifically for people with Asperger's. My PARENTS, who knew about the distinction, still though it would work just as well to have an Autism therapist as an Asperger's therapist. It annoys me to no end that people think that by \"being on your side\", they can treat the situation however they feel.\n\nThe point is that with the distinction being slim for the average person, people assume that we can be treated the same way, and feel the same way about it. It's been hurting me for years, and I'm sure others have been hurt by this too.

  "title": "CMV: Policies that involve the extra-territorialization (off-shoring) of asylum seekers, e.g. Sunak's Rwanda plan, are not necessarily, i.e., in principle, morally unjustified.",
  "selftext": "**Background**\n\nBritish conservative prime minister Sunak has been wanting to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda for the processing and carrying out of their asylum. A few days ago, Sunak and his party suffered a major blow when the UK Supreme Court shot down the plan as being unlawful under the terms of the European convention on human rights. In reaching their decision, the judges partly relied on evidence from the UN Refugee Agency regarding a failed attempt by \\[a certain Jewish state\\] and Rwanda to form a similar pact in 2013.\n\nAccording to the judges, Sunak's Rwanda plan involved an unacceptable risk of *refoulement*, meaning that deported refugees could have their claims wrongly assessed and therefore be returned to their country of origin, where they would be threatened with violence and persecution.\n\nSome members of the conservative party are now proposing to leave the European convention on human rights. Sunak, however, is considering the less drastic route of upgrading the UK's 'memorandum of understanding' it signed with Rwanda into a *full-blown treaty*. This treaty is meant to guarantee minimum quality standards for the asylum process and the shape of the asylum regime.\n\n**Argument**\n\nDecisions such as this one by the UK Supreme Court are often taken by open-borders advocates and progressives of all sorts as pointing to the conclusion that the off-shoring of asylum seekers is morally wrong, full stop. I think this is, sorry for the jargon, a form of *non sequitur* reasoning.\n\nFor, even if the UK Supreme Court may be correct that the *current version* of Sunak's Rwanda plan is morally unacceptable, this in no way makes it the case that a *future version* of the plan or any other off-shoring plan of another state is morally unacceptable.\n\nI would argue that, in principle, it is not morally wrong for a state to choose to off-shore certain asylum seekers, for instance, those who try to illegally reach its borders.\\* However, this comes with an important caveat: the country must not violate its moral duty to take in a proportional share of the global total of asylum seekers. \n\nHere is what the argument roughly looks like:\n\n* P1: States have a moral duty to take in their proportional share of the global total of asylum seekers.\n* P2: The right to asylum does not entail the right to choose one's asylum location: neither for the asylum process, nor for the ensuing asylum regime.\n* P3: If it is possible for a state to take in its share of the global total of asylum seekers, **whilst**, **at the same time**, deporting irregular asylum seekers to a third country that can plausibly promise minimum quality standards for the asylum process and asylum regime, **then** the off-shoring of asylum seekers is not necessarily morally unjustified.\n* P4: It is possible for a state to do both of these things.\n* Conclusion: Policies that involve off-shoring of asylum seekers are not morally unjustified in principle.\n\n**Explanation**\n\nOne extra note regarding premises 3 & 4, a state could take in its share of the global total of asylum seekers by proactively selecting asylum seekers from conflict zones or neighbouring areas, for example, with the help of humanitarian and resettlement programs.\n\nMore positively, I would argue that the off-shoring of asylum seekers, in combination with proactive resettlement policies, is morally preferable to the current asylum system, for two reasons.\n\nFirst of all, unpredictable illegal immigration, with all its housing and integration problems and waste of human lives, would rapidly decrease, since would-be illegal migrants would no longer attempt the journey.\n\nSecond, the current system is unfair, since able-bodied, young men who live geographically close to wealthy states, are much more likely to make a successful illegal journey and claim asylum, than women and children who live very far away.\n\nAll in all, if this argument is sound, then progressives should accept that — in theory — it is possible to design policies for the off-shoring of asylum seekers that, amongst other things, do not infringe on the non-refoulement principle, and are morally justifiable.\n\n\\* I am not saying it is morally wrong of an individual irregular migrant to do so. In fact, I think it is often highly understandable. If you nonetheless dislike the word 'illegal', you can replace it with the word 'irregular'.",

  "selftext": "The whole premise behind life insurance is that you should feel safe knowing that there will be some amount of benefit to the loved ones you leave behind in the event of a tragic accident. Given how society has come to accept mental health's importance as being tantamount or equivalent in magnitude of importance to physical health, as well as the equivalence of mental illness with other physical illnesses, it makes no sense that if you die of a physical illness it should be rewarded whereas if you die of a mental illness it is punished by society.\n\nThere is, of course, the argument that paying the death benefit for individuals who take their own lives would incentivize perverse behaviors, or abuses of the system, tantamount to enabling insurance fraud. But I would argue that seeing as how the very action quite literally terminates your ability to exist, that total cessation of all consciousness and any future in this world being calculated as worthwhile for something like a death benefit should raise alarm bells not for the possible fraud, but for the fraud being enacted on behalf of the insurance companies. After all, if the society we have created is so completely devoid of value to exist within, and has made life so unbearably intolerable for specific individuals, it is a slap in the face to deny them any benefit for the misery they have endured. How can you insure one's life, and then refuse to pay out any amount for one of the leading causes of death? \n\nFurthermore, life insurance that does not pay out for suicide can be considered disgusting and perversely incentivized in its own manner. For example, under the present system, insurance companies will oftentimes be caught manipulating evidence or the system in order to \"prove\" that a deceased individual played some level of willingness in their own demise in order to avoid paying the benefit. Your husband or your father died in a tragic workplace accident? What if we just randomly cherrypicked conversations, or conjured up testimony from coworkers that he \"wasn't feeling too well\", and used that as evidence to submit that they threw themselves into that piece of machinery? Self-inflicted, purposeful, and case closed; your bereaved widowed family is now income-less and that life insurance was worth nothing. \n\nA society that does not make life worth living should not have companies that exist solely to insure against death, refusing to do so when said death is caused by society. There is no consistent or morally justifiable stance against this practice in the face of societal expectations for reality, or at least that is what I think.",

What I mean with uninteresting is that I never really care about people, but about Things. I never really engage with people for the sake of engaging but because I want something, be it information, someone to listen or to help, but never because I care about the other person. People often say I'm an introvert and shy because I don't talk a lot, but the reason is just that I don't see the point in talking with other people. What do I get out of knowing what they think about their favorite Sportsteam, while I don't care about sports at all? What do other people get from such Interactions? It just seams so pointless. I mean I can do it, but there has always been a reason why I would do something like that. For example: to not be seen as a coplete asshole I will listen and nod along with other people in a group and even give the occasional comment when it aligns with my interests. But I find it very hard to ask anything about the other person because there is the immediate though of \"why would I even care about the answer?\". \n\nNow I know I sound like an absolute psychopath that manipulates people for his own gains, but that can't be quite true rither. Why? Because I have been depressed for a very long time and also feel guilt over things I do that harm other people(althoug I dont know if it's guilt over their suffering, or me having to see them suffer). But that is also relative there are situations where I don't feel guilt at all. Now what about animals? Well they for some reason are more interesting then humans, I don't know why but it is probably their lack of personality, or their perceived \"innocence\" I don't know maybe I just see them more as things? \n\nThen we come to the reason as to why I'm here at all, if I don't care about people, why would I want people to change my mind?\nBecause I slowly losing interest in anything and am starting to lose sight of the future.\nWhen I was younger I just thought I was shy and introverted, but that wasn't the case I just had a fundamental lack of interest in people. All my plans for the future have shattered since then. Why would I get married and get a family if I don't really ever care about them? Why would I pursue romance If I'm never really interested in the person, but just a vague Idea of what a relationship should be like?

One solution I propose is that if someone reaches certain target they should get a financial reward in the form of cash or credit when they file their taxes. There could be different ways to do this but I think quarterly examinations including drug tests with your doctor would be a great start.\n\nIt would be funded from a tax on unhealthy foods: fast food, cookie and cake-based dessert snacks, candy, etc. There already similar systems in place with sin taxes and the resulting income going towards society like free community college, road repair, infrastructure improvements.

By making sure they stay in shape they would get rewarded with essentially free rent for a couple months. Now this is for society as a whole and not the 1% who can afford to work out all day. So there should be income limits who qualify ($500,000 + disqualifies from the program). This program would only be for 18+ (dangerous to let developing teens to try and max for income also don't want parents abusing the program with their children as tools) and the tests would be very strict and would large over sight (hefty penalties and jail time for lieing about your results). This system initially would see very few qualifying for the rewards as design because we don't want weak requirements where everyone qualifies. It's not a handout nor is it welfare. It is design to reward and incentize people to get into shape. Being apart of the tax system would also give encouragement and a yearly reminder as well. If people don't want to stay in shape that's fine they don't get the reward come tax time. Ideally this reward would also encourage others who don't try initially but seeing friends and family workout for a reward they would be encourage to try as well. Also having that motivation whether it be for rent a nice toy or even help towards a vacation would do wonders for many.",

And it's always the same whenever you call someone out in the city for being filthy, they're more offended by the fact they've been called out than the act itself. Sure, there's a good bit of that outside the city too (after all, we do have a reputation for being a very, let's say \"proud\" people), but like the rest of my points, it just seems so much worse in the city. \n\nTl:dr: if you live in the city and you complain about how dirty it is, you better drop the entitlement and pick up a broom.",

  "selftext": "There's this popular notion that sex is the ultimate expression of love. The idea goes even further that the sex is an indication of how strong your love to your spouse is. And if you dont have much sex (say you don't find your spouse attractive anymore) then that somehow shows that you don't love your spouse unconditionally, or that your love to them is somewhat diminished. But this idea of equating love and sex is so foreign to me.\n\nSexual attraction and love are very much unrelated. I love my kids, my parents, or my platonic friends, yet I have zero sexual attraction to them. I can lust after a sexy man/girl yet have no love for them whatsoever. Rape actually illustrates that very well, you are sexually attracted to the victim (I guess you love the way the victim arouses you), but no one would call this love in any shape or form, that would a gross misinterpretation of love. A less extreme example would be a one night stand, where there is no real love involved, just sexual gratification, the act of sex serves the latter purpose well. Now of course you can love your wife **and** be sexually attracted to her, but thats not always the case, and if I somehow lost sexual attraction to her, that doesn't say anything about my platonic love towards her, I can still love everything else about her, and my love would arguably even more genuine than the love someone has towards their spouse that is based on their mutual sexual attraction.\n\nLet's face it: Sex is a selfish and exploitative act. It can be reciprocal for sure, and we usualluy strive for that in a loving and healthy relationship. But sex by definition is a form of gratifying your sexual urges by exploiting someone else's body for your needs, albiet with consent. So sex is really at odds with love (this may be the idea behind the incest taboo, but I digress). Sex by consent can definitely coexist with love in a loving relationship, but if it doesn't, that shouldn't be an indication that they somehow fell out of love (although I do understand why someone would want out of such a relationship, since sex is an integral part of a traditional marital agreement and they are not being provided).\n\nBut for some reason, this myth has been so ingrained in our culture, that it's hard to even think that sex is not an expression of love at all. It's almost taboo to argue otherwise. Why do you think I'm wrong? And where do you disagree with me?\n\nEDIT: I agree that sex can be an expression of love, just like playing a game with your spouse, or serving them dinner, can be. But I don't think it is superior to the other forms, and more importantly I don't think that it is a good metric by which we can measure one's love to their spouse. There are so many reasons ppl have sex other than because they simply want to express their love. In most cases it is done for more selfish and mundane reasons, hence the reason for why I think it is not a *genuine* expression of love.\n\n&#x200B;",

  "title": "CMV: Romantic relationships with only children generally require an unfair amount of effort.",
  "selftext": "I’m not a psychologist, and I’ve done zero archival research into the topic. My opinion formed from two past relationships with women who grew up without siblings. I acknowledge that I’m generalizing. \n\nI believe that maintaining romantic relationships with only children is much harder. I believe that growing up with siblings teaches us important social lessons about emotions, sharing living space, and how to communicate. These lessons can be learned elsewhere, but are easiest learned by loving and living with someone (or someones) for the first 18 years of your life. \n\nI will begin by stating that only children live increasingly “me-centered” existences. They’ve rarely had to compete for a parents’ attention, love, or care. Onlies generally grew up without the child-aged jealousy after craving a parents’ affection or time and watching a sibling receive it instead. For example, a young kid may think “I would like to cuddle with mom,” but mom may choose to cuddle a brother instead because its his turn. These experiences teach a person to form realistic expectations about love and attention, which translate down the road to emotional maturity in a relationship. Onlies generally never experience what it’s like to have a sick sibling, and being told to fend for oneself (at a reasonable age), or even being cast away to another caregiver. For example, when I was 12, my brother was seriously ill for two months. Hospitalized. My dad worked and my mom stayed with him in the hospital. Unless dad was home, I was stuck caring for my younger brother and myself. A neighbor checked in on us hourly. This experience teaches a person the importance of priorities, and prevents a “drop every one else for me” mindset that I’ve come to find Onlies develop throughout their lives. \n\nOnly children typically grow up with their own living space to themself. Typically decorating, furniture choices, and habits are never challenged by someone else. Siblings might have to share a bathroom, a bedroom, or other portions of the living space. Siblings are quick to point out “you don’t need to take up the entire bathroom with all of your make up.” Onlies grow up without these experiences, and when confronted as adults about how they might have tough to handle habits, they are discovering this for the first time in their life. Decoration and furniture conflicts might be the first challenges they’ve ever experienced. I had an ex girlfriend tell me she hasn’t had to “deal with” other people’s stuff in her space before. \n\nCommunication is also very important and growing up with siblings, a person (hopefully) learns a healthier way to express their thoughts and feelings to someone that they love and have to see every day. Siblings teach you that even though someone is bothering you in the moment, they aren’t going anywhere for a long time, so it’s important to confront the issue instead of avoiding it. Siblings teach us how to go about confronting issues in a way that doesn’t make the conflict worse. \n\nSiblings are kind of like a non-gross dry run at a relationship that only children miss out on. Obviously there are ways to learn these skills and have these experiences later in life, and obviously some house holds with multiple children aren’t perfect. There are plenty of people with brothers and sisters who don’t communicate, share, or are jealous. Again, I’m generalizing. Communication can fix a lot of these issues, but I hated telling a 26 year old woman that she needed to share and compromise almost daily, as if she were 4 years old. \n\nFeel free to tell me that my past relationships made me bitter, maybe I need to hear that. Not a joke.",

If someone is wanting to be understood in what they’re trying to convey, why is that upsetting? It’s like gatekeeping humor or communication or something?

  "selftext": "Part of the problem of consumer debt is that payments towards a loan are applied to interest prior to the principal, which extends the loan life as it is more difficult to make progress on the interest generating portion of the loan. Further, the interest capitalizes into the principal which compounds the problem. \n\nIt doesn’t make sense that payments made towards the loan are applied to interest prior to principal, because the principal investment is what is used to generate the interest returns. One could not make the interest income without investing into some sort of asset in which the asset then generates the profit/value of the interest. \n\nIf interest is the combination of opportunity cost and risk, then once the principal amount is paid off, how is the initial loan offerer assuming risk? It ought to be the case that the value of the principal has already been recognized and cannot grow in value. The profit would still need to be paid off (interest) but it cannot grow further. Assets aside from land and human capital are subject to depreciation, so the model of a principal investment as an asset that cannot depreciate (but does carry risk in the form of default) is incorrect. \n\nThe strongest counter argument I can think of is that money is fungible and that one cannot differentiate between the dollar that generated the revenue and the one that was the initial investment. The consequence of this is that capitalization should occur instantly and not on a schedule.\n\nI’m sure there are other arguments against this and would love to hear them!

  "title": "CMV: No state or provincial political party should be allowed to have the same name as a federal political party",
  "selftext": "When a state, provincial, or regional political party shares their name with a federal political party, voters have trouble distinguishing the two. This impedes these parties' ability to tailor their policies to their region. And for states that are significantly more right wing or left wing than the country as a whole, this often leads to uncompetitive elections and extended single-party rule, which are cancer to democracy. The solution is obvious: prohibit any regional party from having the same name as a federal party.\n\nThe best evidence supporting my argument comes from the US. But I want to encourage people to look at this with fresh eyes, so let's focus on an example from a different country.\n\nAlberta is significantly more right wing than Canada as a whole. So it's no surprise that in federal elections, 85%-100% of the people Alberta elects to parliament consistently come from the most prominent right wing federal party.\n\nThis lack of competition isn't great, but it's acceptable. Because unless a country can sustain a high number of prominent, competitive federal parties, it makes sense that people in the country's most right wing (or left wing) region are going to feel like they only have one viable option in national elections.\n\nProvincial elections should be much more competitive. Provincial parties should be free to fine-tune their policies to Alberta, since other Canadians don't get to vote. So although Albertans consistently vote for a single party federally, on the provincial level they should have a competitive, thriving democracy.\n\nThis should be true, but it isn't.\n\nFrom 1971 to 2015—*44 years*—Alberta's Progressive Conservative Party ruled the province. They won a majority government in 12 consecutive elections, so no other party had any negotiating power for nearly half a century.\n\nAll three major provincial parties—the Progressive Conservatives, the Liberals, and the NDP—shared their names with the three biggest federal parties. Albertans already knew the federal Liberals and the federal NDP were too left wing for their taste, so it was incredibly difficult for the provincial Liberals or the provincial NDP to gain a foothold.\n\nTake oil as an example. Alberta has tons of oil, so Albertans tend to support pro-oil policies. The federal NDP generally opposes oil extraction. The provincial NDP, however, is far more pro-oil because they know their voters and they want a shot in hell at winning elections.\n\nBut most Albertans don't know this. The federal NDP gets more media coverage than the provincial NDP, so Albertans naturally associate the provincial NDP with the federal NDP's policies. The provincial NDP can shout until they're hoarse that they support the oil sands, but few Albertans hear them and fewer believe them.\n\nThe provincial NDP tries to tailor their policies to Alberta, but their name holds them back from gaining as much support as they otherwise could.\n\nSo why doesn't the Alberta NDP simply change their name? This seems like a problem that should fix itself.\n\nFor three reasons:\n\n1\\. They still benefit from the name recognition of the NDP moniker, which every Canadian is familiar with.\n\n2\\. Their ties to the federal NDP help with organization and fundraising.\n\n3\\. The dominant Alberta party, the Progressive Conservatives\\*, have no reason to change their name and break their association with their federal counterparts.\n\nThis last point is the most important. The provincial NDP adopting a new name would do nothing to diminish the enormous boon the provincial Progressive Conservative Party gets from being heavily associated with the only federal political party most Albertans find acceptable.\n\nIf the provincial NDP changed their name, it would be unilateral disarmament. They would suffer in terms of name recognition, organization, and fundraising, while their rivals would retain all these benefits.\n\nThe dominant party will never voluntarily give up this advantage, so they need to be forced. No state, provincial, or regional political party should be legally allowed to share a name with a federal party. At least not any federal party that gets more than 1% of the vote, so provincial parties don't need to worry about sharing a name with one of the dozen tiny federal parties no one pays attention to.\n\nIf this rule were adopted, Alberta would be a big beneficiary. But there are a bunch of American states that would benefit even more.\n\nPolitical tribalism is so entrenched in the US that the winner of many state elections is a foregone conclusion. If you're hoping, for example, that Democrats will lose the next California election or that Republicans will lose the next Texas election, you're going to be disappointed.\n\nWith no competition, the dominant party has little motivation to provide for their people. They grow incompetent, like the California Democrats, or vindictive, like many state Republican parties. If you're virtually guaranteed to continue winning elections, you're free to attack people who oppose you instead of trying to gain their support.\n\nThe nationalization of politics has made it nearly impossible for regional parties to get out of the shadow of their federal counterparts. Most people establish their political identity based on federal issues, since that's what we hear about most. We put much less thought into regional politics. So if there's a regional party with the same name as the federal party you support, you're likely to vote for that party without putting much thought into it.\n\nIf state political parties all had different names than federal parties, people would actually have to think before voting in state elections. You couldn't blindly transfer your judgements about federal parties over to the state level. You would actually have to pay attention to local news, read the state parties' policies, and watch the debates.\n\nStates and provinces deserve to have competitive elections and parties whose policies are tailored specifically to the needs of their region. Democracy works far, far better with competitive elections than with single-party rule.\n\nLet's look at some counterarguments:\n\n1\\. Regional parties already have different policies than their federal counterparts. The former are not carbon copies of the latter.\n\nThis is true to some extent. But not nearly to the extent it would be if regional parties weren't handcuffed by their names.\n\nYou may even be able to find examples where this is true to a large extent. But the clear trend is that regional parties have significant trouble differentiating themselves from their identically named federal counterparts.\n\n2\\. This regulation wouldn't accomplish as much as you think it would. Sure, it would stop people from conflating federal parties with regional parties. But some states and provinces would still have uncompetitive elections and extended single-party rule. And people still wouldn't pay enough attention to regional elections.\n\nNo, my idea is not a panacea. It wouldn't fix these problems completely. It would just help fix them.\n\n3\\. If regional parties are forced to change their names, people will still figure out which regional parties are similar to which federal parties.\n\nThis is only nominally a counterargument. Because making voters figure out where regional parties stand is one of the primary aims of my idea. If you do research and discover that Texas' new Armadillo Party shares 90% of their policies with the federal Republican Party, then you've become a much more informed voter.\n\n4\\. Regional parties will try to skirt the rule. Instead of the Texas Republican Party changing their name to the Armadillo Party, they'll just call themselves the GOP, which is a nickname for the Republican Party.\n\nIf parties try to skirt the rule, the rule will need to be enforced strictly. The country's elections agency should make rulings on whether a regional party's proposed name is too closely associated with a federal party.\n\nWill there be tough calls?\n\nYup.\n\nThe fact that it won't be easy to draw the line is a horrible argument for drawing no line at all. There will always be edge cases that are difficult to decide. This shouldn't deter us from striving to strengthen democracy.\n\n5\\. But the elections agencies in many countries suck. For example, the Federal Election Commission in the US is doomed to perpetual gridlock, with votes on most important things resulting in a 3-3 tie.\n\nMy proposal is not a good solution for countries with elections agencies that are corrupt or structurally designed to be ineffective. If this describes your country, you need to deal with this problem first.\n\n6\\. Would a regional party be allowed to have the same name as a regional party in a different part of the country? If this were prohibited, it would be much more difficult to enforce because there would be a much larger list of names that regional parties have to avoid.\n\nIt *could* be somewhat harmful for parties in different regions to share the same name. But I'm not convinced it'll be harmful enough to forbid it.\n\nPeople pay little attention to local news in other parts of the country, so a Texan is unlikely to conflate the policies of the Texas Armadillo Party with the policies of the Louisiana Armadillo Party. It's also far less plausible that a Louisiana political party would have influence over a Texas political party than it is that a federal political party would have influence over a state/provincial/regional political party.\n\n7\\. This puts too much of a burden on voters. If we can't blindly vote for the same party regionally that we vote for federally, then we'll have to pay attention during election campaigns and think before we vote.\n\nOh no. How horrible.\n\n8\\. There are many problems with elections, such as gerrymandering and low turnout, that this would do nothing to fix.\n\nThis isn't supposed to fix everything. It's just supposed to be an improvement.\n\nFootnote:  \n\\*I know they're not called the Progressive Conservatives anymore. But if I talk about the Wildrose Alliance and the United Conservative Party, this post is going to get longer and it's already too long.",

So morality is not objective \n\nPeople who argue like this don’t usually state (2), but this is an assumption that’s required for the argument’s validity. And it’s an assumption that’s implausible: it doesn’t follow from the fact that people disagree about a matter that there is no objective fact about the matter. Intelligent, thoughtful people have debated the existence of God for millennia. And today, we have flat earthers who disagree with the prevailing science. There is also intense debate about the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. But no one would say that there is no fact of the matter in any of these issues - either God exists or he doesn’t; either the earth is flat or it isn’t; either some or other interpretation of QM is correct or it isn’t. The fact that people disagree is irrelevant. \n\n**The argument from lack of epistemic access**\n\n1. If there is no reliable way to come to know moral truths, then morality is not objective \n2. There is no reliable way to come to know moral truths \n3. So morality is not objective \n\nAn argument of this sort was given by J. L. Mackie. Firstly, premise (1) needs some defence. It may be that there is a fact of the matter even if humans don’t have the required capacities to determine those facts. We can’t know everything, after all. \n\nBut suppose it’s true that we don’t have any reliable way to come to know moral truths. Even if not an argument against objectivism, it would be an argument for moral *skepticism*—we wouldn’t be justified in thinking that any moral claim is true. We would have to suspend judgement on all things morality, and this is plainly a challenge to the moral realist. \n\nIn response, we can say that there are reliable methods for coming to know moral truths—relatively uncontroversial methods that we use to come to know other kinds of truths. Suppose utilitarianism is true: An act is right iff it produces greater overall well-being than any other action that could have been done in the circumstances. In that case, we can establish moral claims using observation. This is about as reliable a method as any. \n\nOr suppose you’re the sort of person who thinks we can have substantive a priori knowledge. In that case, very basic moral principles seem to be just the sort of things that can be known a priori.",

I'm not refuting this, but what I do refute is that being the root cause of why [ADHD diagnoses have tripled since 2010](https://epicresearch.org/articles/number-of-adhd-patients-rising-especially-among-women). It makes too much sense to me that dwindling attention spans and constant hits of dopamine received through engagement on social media are a root cause of the massive increase in ADHD diagnoses we see today. I see this as a frightening issue when one of the most common medications to treat this disorder is amphetamines, which is essentially legalized meth. The difference between 30mg of Adderall and 30mg of methamphetamine is not actually that much; meth addicts just don't take 30mg of the stuff in practice. I am worried for us as a society when we are so quick to treat this problem with a potentially even bigger problem, without having serious concern for the root cause of it. \n\nADHD is a disorder characterized by a dopamine deficiency in the body, and we treat it with amphetamines because, like meth, it is a drug that causes your brain to release dopamine. Outside of tolerance it does not build up in your system, meaning if you miss one single dose, your symptoms that day will be much worse than if you never started taking amphetamines at all. I am not trying to imply that we should ban amphetamines for people with ADHD who benefit from it, but I feel strongly that we should treat it as the sharp double edged sword that it is, and question why it was taken from its sheath to begin with. Many children these days grow up with smart phones and tablets watching YouTube and other forms of social media that have been proven to be incredibly addictive, that is a known issue. What doesn't seem to be debated as much though is the potential this has to turn into permanent drug dependency problems later on in life. Again, I'd love to be proven wrong on this.",

Men are told they’re toxic, misogynist, lacking emotional intelligence, bad at dating – everything is wrong with us. Regardless of what you think about whether this is justified or not, or how much of it is, the fact is that by far the most that men hear from this side is negativity: **what not to do** and **how not to be**.\n\nWhat men get comparatively little of, is any kind of indication of positive alternatives: **what to do** and **how to be**. If not this, then what? What is expected of us? What would be the right things to do? Sure, there are some positive narratives or role models on the progressive side, but as far as my searches show, it's a small minority. There are many on the conservative side though. The progressives hate them, but rarely offer anything in their place, only double down on the criticism.\n\nBut there is something very basic and primal about human psychology: we like the people who are nice and help us, and don’t like the ones who are mean and criticise us.

  "selftext": "To expand on this: it seems like most people who watch professional sports do so because they have a specific team they cheer for.

If you're friends with someone on a pro sports team, go ahead and cheer them on.  You're not who I'm talking about in this post. \n\nThe way I see it is this: lots of games are exciting.  Surprise plays, turnovers, and things like that can be thrilling to witness.  But if you're rooting for one specific team, then there's always this sort of \"NO NO NO NO NO!\" reaction when these plays aren't in your favor, or even when a completely different team that you're not even playing against wins a different match and adversely affects your playoff chances.  \n\nBut if you're just watching for the sake of seeing a bunch of professional athletes excel at what they do, then there's never any drawback.  An exciting game is an exciting game, regardless of who wins, so you come away happy for having watched it.  \n\nHere's an analogy: compare a horror movie to an entire sports season.  Say you pick a character or actor who you want to see survive until the end of the movie, but they get killed (eliminated from the playoffs) long before the movie is even over.  Now you're bummed that the character is gone, right?  But what if you're just watching the movie for the sake of seeing the story play out, regardless of who lives or dies by the end?  No matter what happens, as long as it's an interesting movie, you've won.\n\nThis is meant to be a light-hearted CMV.  I do not begrudge anyone for cheering for any given team.  I'm not trying to say that people who cheer for a given team are somehow bad in any way.  I just think it makes more sense to watch the game without putting your hopes into any particular outcome, and tying your enjoyment of the match to the relative number of points scored by one group versus another.  \n\nAnd let me throw this out here: yes, I have seen my local professional teams win championships before.  I have witnessed, in-person, the home team be down almost the entire game before coming back to win the championship in the final three minutes.

  "selftext": "The Supreme Court is scheduled to make a ruling within the next 3-4 weeks, and many are expecting it to rule against Harvard (in the upcoming *SFFA vs. Harvard* case) and strike down affirmative action to some extent.\n\nThe facts of the case are that Harvard is being accused of discriminating against Asian applicants in two ways: first, by requiring Asians to have a higher SAT score in order to be considered for admission (than other races) and secondly, by assigning a lower \"personality score\" to Asian applicants than other races.\n\nNow, it's not ideal for Harvard to have to resort to such practices. But the alternative is that Harvard would wind up with a student body that's 40% Asian. How is that ideal, and how does that benefit other students or diversity as a whole?\n\nLet's look at the University of California system for an example. Decades ago, Californian voters abolished race-conscious affirmative action via referendum. The result was that Asians shot way up in college admissions at the UCs while black, Hispanic and other students fell in representation. (If I recall correctly, universities like UCLA and Berkley became 30-40% Asian.)\n\nAdmissions is a zero-sum affair; every college has limited seats. You admit more of one race, and the other races must necessarily fall behind and be less represented. Given the benefits that diversity has to offer for student learners, how can a (hypothetical) Harvard student body of 40% Asians, 50% whites, and 10% all other races possibly be more beneficial for the learners (and society overall) than something like 15% Asians, 50% whites, and 35% everyone else?\n\nIt should also be pointed out that Asians are already way over-represented even **with** affirmative action (they are only 6% of America's population but are already represented at around 20% in the Ivy Leagues.) If anything, Asian students should be held to an even *tougher* standard than they currently are, so that their representation can plummet down to something more suitable like 10-12% (which would **still** be over-representation.)\n\nSo, how else is Harvard supposed to achieve a diverse student body **without** resorting to tactics like making Asian students score higher on the SAT than other racial groups? Bear in mind that many other racial groups, such as African-American students, suffer from growing up in poverty or dysfunctional families in a way that many Asian-American students do not.",

  "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nWhile I'm sure AI can be good (see: Star Trek or any futuristic utopian setting), the current global situation and the way humanity is won't benefit from it. I don't think this is specifically about our *modern* situation, it's just how humanity has always been and -most likely- will always be. Humans seek value, and will to benefit themselves, we are not purely altruistic.\n\n\n\nAI will displace humans out of jobs that previously required mental effort. Copy writing, content creation, writing articles etc. Inlucing producing visual art. Companies will these programs and tools instead of relying on humans. \n\n\n\n1) While some may argue that the level of skill isn't the same (which is a reasonable claim *currently*) the gap in skill isn't great enough for many companies to care about.  While big companies or projects will seek out top talent, the majority of the work force won't find vacancies with smaller or medium companies.\n\n\n\n2) Previously human physical labor could be replaced with machines, but the reason this hasn't taken over completely was because these machines were very expensive. AI tools and programs are not so expensive as to be a financial burden.\n\n\n\nIt isn't necessary (as some may imagine) to *completely* remove humans from the workforce to create a dystopia. Unemployment at 10% is a problem, if that skyrockets it will be enough to create dystopian poverty.\n\n\n\nGoing back to my first paragraph, some have argued that AI will give us a chance to build a utopia, however I find this to be based on little other than pointless hope. It's no different than saying there's a chance Jeff Bezos might decide next to give away his entire fortune. Companies and powerful entities in power would never let go of wealth without sufficient reason.\n\n\n\nUBI is a great idea but there's no reason to actual think it might happen. The only probable solution to this problem is if governments decide to put heavy restrictions on companies utilizing AI, but not only is that chance unreliable, even if it did happen the restrictions most likely won't be enough to deter the negative outcomes.\n\n\n\nI don't have enough of an opinion to talk about other points, although I do believe in them, such as problems in logistics, where AI can flood institutions with submissions to the point where human submissions are pushed out (accordig to an article on The Verge). Or how art can lose its meaning and people cna just use it to produce their own music (such as the Drake AI). A big part of the issue is that even low-quality AI content can be severely harmful.\n\n\n\nGiven all that, I've come to consider that people partaking in developing AI are performing an immoral act by harming humanity (I would not call these people immoral themselves, simply the act). Yet many do so out of a belief in the necessity to \"progress\" believing that advancement is an objective good and that no harm can come out of it. Or that that they do it because they can, or they do it because they know it will happen and they just want to be a part of it (instead of choosing not to support it).\n\n\n\nThe only counter-arguments I hear are \"people said the same thing about cars or computers\", and to be honest the difference between mechanical machines and AI are so vast I don't believe this argument is even worth addressing.\n\n\n\nHowever, I'm open to the concept that there's reasonable argument for AI actually being a *good* thing now and later on in history, and that this probability isn't merely hinged on blind hope. So I'm trying to see if I can change my view.",

  "selftext": "*Moore vs Harper* is essentially a case where the right is trying to argue that state constitutions don’t apply when the state legislature is acting on a federal power, in this case election law. The issue is that state courts have had judicial review over all affairs of the state for years, and taking this away would likely destabilize democracy and allow politicians to run amok of their own state constitutions, which is generally how democracies and republics end. There is a possibility that the NC legislature loses the argument but that is unlikely so it’ll be the death of the country we knew. \n\nI do think we will retain our status as a global power but one mired in one of the world’s worst cases of minority rule ever seen.",
